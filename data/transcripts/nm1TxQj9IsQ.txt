[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.680]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.060]   Today's podcast episode is all about sleep.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.020]   We're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep,
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.820]   which is wakefulness.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180]   Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness,
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.600]   govern everything about our mental and physical health.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.160]   And we're not just gonna talk about
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.140]   what's useful about sleep.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.120]   We're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.840]   And that will include how to get better at falling asleep,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.920]   timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.620]   In doing so, we're also gonna discuss
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.780]   how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.620]   So because sleep and wakefulness are related,
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.960]   we really can't have a conversation
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   about one without the other.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.700]   Now, in keeping with this theme,
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020]   you may catch a few snores in the background.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.980]   Unlike me, my bulldog Costello
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.900]   can fall asleep anywhere, anytime,
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.180]   and he happens to be sleeping over there in the corner.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.320]   So if you hear snoring, that's what that's about.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.700]   As always, I wanna just mention that this podcast
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.460]   is part of my effort to bring zero cost to consumer,
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.260]   public education about science and science-related tools.
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.820]   It is unrelated to my teaching and research roles
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.180]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.240]   Today's podcast is brought to us by Helix Mattresses.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   Having the proper sleep environment,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.960]   both the environment you're sleeping in
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840]   and the object you're sleeping on,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.640]   is critically important to getting a good night's sleep.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.120]   Helix Mattresses are a little different than most
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.020]   because they're matched to your specific sleep needs,
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.320]   as well as whether or not you tend to run hot or cold
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.620]   as you sleep through the night,
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.860]   what position you sleep in, and so forth.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.480]   So if you go to their website,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.760]   they have a quiz that you can take
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.720]   that matches you to the particular mattress
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   that's gonna be best for your sleep needs.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.900]   I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.660]   I'm one of these people that can fall asleep easily,
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.500]   but then I wake up and I have a hard time
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.720]   getting back to sleep.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840]   And once I switched to a Helix Mattress
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.400]   that was precisely matched to my sleep needs,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.720]   I found I could sleep through the night,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.020]   which has made a tremendous difference for me.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.660]   If you wanna try Helix Mattresses,
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.400]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.480]   and that will give you up to $200 off on a mattress order,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.760]   as well as two pillows free with your mattress order.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640]   And of course, having the proper pillows
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.780]   is just as important as having the proper mattress.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.880]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.560]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   that teaches you how to meditate.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.280]   It's fair to say that now there's a ton of research
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.320]   out there in peer-reviewed journals
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.560]   supporting the fact that mindfulness meditation
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.600]   can support mental and physical health.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   But many people find it hard to meditate.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.280]   In fact, I'm one of these people.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   I started meditating in my teens,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.980]   but then I would drop it every few weeks or so,
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.220]   and then I'd get back to it
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.160]   maybe the following week or every year.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.920]   I just was not very regular about my meditation practice.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.540]   And then a few years ago, I was flying a lot for work
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.000]   and I was on JetBlue flights,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.360]   and they have Headspace as part of the choice of things
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.120]   that you can watch on the TV screen.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.780]   And as I started meditating more regularly,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.880]   what I found is my sleep was better,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.000]   I would arrive feeling more rested.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.920]   It just had tremendous effects on my work performance
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.020]   and other aspects of my life.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.020]   If you wanna try Headspace, you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.300]   If you do that, you'll get one month
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.120]   of all of Headspace's meditations for free.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.760]   That's the best offer right now.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.360]   So if interested, go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.180]   So let's talk about sleep.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.000]   Sleep is this incredible period of our lives
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   where we are not conscious.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.480]   We might dream, we might twitch, we might even wake up,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.180]   but in sleep, we are only in relation
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.860]   to things that are happening within our brain and body.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.880]   Outside sensory experience, in most cases,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.820]   can't really impact us.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.100]   And yet sleep is this tremendously important period of life
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.620]   because it resets our ability to be focused, alert,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.200]   and emotionally stable in the wakeful period.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.500]   So we can't really talk about wakefulness, focus,
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.120]   motivation, mood, wellbeing without thinking about sleep.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.140]   And that's why we're devoting this entire month
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.220]   to the discussion about sleep.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.700]   But we also can't talk about sleep and think about sleep
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.340]   without thinking about wakefulness,
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.100]   because it turns out that the period that we call sleep
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.740]   and the period we call wakefulness
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.660]   are tethered to one another.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.420]   What we do in the waking state determines
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.880]   when we fall asleep, how quickly we fall asleep,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820]   whether or not we stay asleep,
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.500]   and how we feel when we wake up the next day.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.140]   And today, we're gonna talk mostly
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.820]   about how to get better at sleeping.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.440]   And the reason for starting the conversation that way,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.460]   as opposed to just diving into a lot of biology about sleep,
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.340]   is because first of all, there's a lot of information
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340]   out there already about the biology of sleep.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.760]   We're gonna touch on a little bit of this,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.740]   things like stages of sleep and sleep spindles,
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.360]   melatonin, and dreaming.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.440]   But I think that by now, most people are aware
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.360]   that getting a really good night's sleep
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.540]   on a consistent basis is critically important.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.060]   But most people don't know how to do that.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.340]   In fact, I'm guessing that very few of you out there
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.320]   are consistently getting seven to nine hours
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.260]   of really terrific sleep, waking up feeling rested,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.900]   like you're ready to attack the day,
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.100]   and being able to go through the day feeling focused
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.560]   and alert without dips in energy or focus.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.880]   So if you're like most people, which includes me,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.740]   you have some challenges with sleep,
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.080]   at least every third or fifth night or so,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.680]   and maybe even more often.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.540]   So we're really gonna go tool heavy today
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.000]   and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.660]   sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.300]   And we're gonna do that by grounding our discussion
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.400]   of tools in peer-reviewed studies,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.300]   mostly from the last 10 years,
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.500]   although some even more recent than that.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.080]   And we're gonna start by discussing what is sleep
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.500]   and what governs the timing of the onset of sleep.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.540]   In other words, what makes you get sleepy
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.500]   at a particular time of day.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.060]   So what determines how well we sleep
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.180]   and the quality of our wakeful state?
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.680]   Turns out that's governed by two forces.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.320]   The first force is a chemical force.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.580]   It's called adenosine.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.860]   Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.740]   that builds up the longer we are awake.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.020]   So if you've just slept for eight or nine or 10
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.420]   really deep restful hours,
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.860]   adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.940]   If however you've been awake for 10, 15 or more hours,
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.700]   adenosine levels are going to be much higher.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.460]   Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.980]   And actually hunger is the appropriate word here
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.860]   because for most of what we're gonna discuss today,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.380]   we can think of it in an analogous way to nutrition.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.340]   Your nutrition and how well you feel
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.340]   after you eat certain foods,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.740]   your overall level of fitness and your cellular health
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.100]   and your heart health isn't governed by any one food item
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.600]   that you might eat or not eat.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.400]   It's governed by a number of different factors.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   How often you eat, how much you eat,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.380]   which items you eat, et cetera,
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.420]   and what works best for you.
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.140]   In the same way, your sleep and your wakefulness
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.860]   are the product of kind of the average
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.700]   of a number of different behaviors.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.720]   How long you've been awake is a key one
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.300]   because of this molecule adenosine.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.980]   So the reason you get sleepy
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.940]   when you've been up for a while
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.820]   is because adenosine is creeping up steadily
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.620]   the longer you've been awake.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.900]   And a good way to remember this and think about adenosine
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.340]   is to think about caffeine.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.240]   Caffeine for most people,
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.300]   except a very small percentage of people, wakes them up.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.040]   It makes them feel more alert.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.740]   In fact, some people are so sensitive to caffeine
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.180]   that they feel jittery if they drink it
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.620]   even in small amounts.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.780]   Other people can drink large amounts of caffeine
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.740]   and not feel jittery at all.
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.260]   Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.220]   What that means is that when you ingest caffeine,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.400]   whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.720]   or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.780]   It sort of parks there,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.500]   just like a car would park in a given parking slot,
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.920]   and therefore adenosine can't park in that slot.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.100]   nothing really happens downstream of that receptor.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.940]   The receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.540]   of making that cell and you feel sleepy.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.340]   So the reason caffeine wakes you up
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.100]   is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.820]   It blocks the sleepy signal.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.500]   And this is why when that caffeine wears off,
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.580]   adenosine will bind to that receptor
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.380]   sometimes with even greater, what we call affinity,
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.060]   and you feel the crash, you feel especially tired.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.020]   Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.740]   I love caffeine.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.500]   I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.260]   But I'm one of these people that either
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.240]   because of my tolerance or because of some genetic variations
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.700]   that exist among people
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.340]   in terms of their adenosine receptors,
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.820]   I can drink caffeine as late as four or 5 p.m.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.700]   in the evening and still fall asleep just fine.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.360]   Some people can't have any caffeine at all
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.720]   or can't have any caffeine past 11 a.m.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.000]   or else their sleep is totally disrupted.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.780]   All of this has to do with the relationship
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.820]   between adenosine and these adenosine receptors,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.700]   genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.120]   except experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.820]   and figure out for yourselves
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.640]   whether or not you can tolerate caffeine
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.280]   and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.540]   So rather than demonize caffeine or say that,
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.760]   everyone can drink caffeine until late,
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.320]   you need to figure out what's right for you.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.180]   Caffeine has a lot of health benefits.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.280]   It also, for some people can be problematic for health.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.380]   It can raise blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.660]   Caffeine increases this molecule
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.220]   that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.160]   We discussed this in episode one,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.780]   which tends to make us feel good,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.180]   motivated and give us energy
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.380]   because as you may have learned in episode one,
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.260]   dopamine is related to another neuromodulator
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.380]   called epinephrine, which gives us energy.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.840]   In fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.120]   So let's just take a step back
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.860]   and think about what we're talking about
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.620]   when we're talking about sleepiness.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.900]   Sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.460]   that happen naturally.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.320]   Caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.960]   of making us sleepy by blocking that receptor.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.460]   So it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.500]   but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.620]   Other people can tolerate it just fine.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.260]   So you need to determine that experimentally.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.860]   All the data say there's tremendous variation
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.020]   and right now the only way that I'm aware of
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.660]   for you to decide whether or not caffeine
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.780]   is a good or a bad thing for you
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.540]   and whether or not you should ingest it
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.020]   at a given time of day or at all
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.700]   is really to figure that out on your own.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.820]   In fact, there's a small subset of people
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.420]   that can drink caffeine until very late
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.060]   and they have no trouble falling asleep
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.380]   because they actually have a mutant form
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.020]   of the adenosine receptor.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.920]   So in keeping with the theme of science
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.520]   and science-related tools,
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   this is one of those cases where I can't give you
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.920]   a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.660]   you need to experiment with caffeine
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.080]   in a way that's safe for you and explore that
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.160]   and figure out what works for you and then stick with that.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.540]   Okay, so adenosine is driving the sleep hunger.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.420]   When adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed,
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.540]   we're not very hungry.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.520]   And when adenosine is high,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.160]   it's like we're fasted for a long time
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.820]   and we tend to be very hungry.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.500]   So when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.840]   If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment,
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.320]   but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.540]   than you're used to staying up
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.200]   and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.860]   That's because adenosine is building up
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.580]   at levels higher and higher
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.780]   because you've been awake for those extra four hours.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.280]   However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.160]   you'll notice something interesting.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.540]   As morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.460]   in your energy and alertness again.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.260]   Even though adenosine has been building up
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.560]   for the entire night.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.100]   Why is that?
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.660]   The reason that is is because there's a second force
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.760]   which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.700]   And that force is a so-called circadian force.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.380]   Circadian means about a day or about 24 hours.
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.140]   And inside all of us is a clock
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.560]   that exists in your brain and my brain
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.860]   and the brain of every animal that we're aware of
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.940]   that determines when we want to be sleepy
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.980]   and when we want to be awake.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.800]   Just think about it.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.780]   We don't go through the day
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.900]   wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.220]   and then feeling like we're wide awake.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   Our sleep and our period of sleepiness
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.660]   tends to be condensed into one block.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.140]   Typically one six to 10 hour block.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.820]   Although there's also variation
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   in terms of how much people want to sleep.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.020]   And we're going to discuss
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.340]   how you can diagnose your absolute sleep need
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.660]   as well as how to recover sleep that you've lost.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.460]   That block of sleep
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.660]   and when it falls within each 24 hour cycle
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.940]   is governed by a number of different things.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.700]   But the most powerful thing that's governing
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.060]   when you want to be asleep
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.780]   and when you want to be awake is light.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.400]   And in particular, it's governed by sunlight.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.820]   Now I can't emphasize enough how important
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.700]   and how actionable this relationship is
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.540]   between light and when you want to sleep.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.500]   It's quite simple on the face of it.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.060]   And it's quite simple to resolve
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.900]   but people tend to make a big mess
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.460]   of this whole circadian literature, frankly.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.260]   So let's just break it down from the standpoint
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.180]   of what's going on in your brain and body
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.360]   as you go through one 24 hour day.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.820]   Let's start with waking.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.940]   So regardless of how well you slept at night
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.120]   or whether or not you were up all night,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.940]   most people tend to wake up sometime
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.200]   around when the sun rises.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.580]   Maybe not right at sunrise,
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.100]   but within an hour or two or maybe three of sunrise.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.900]   I realize there are night shift workers
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.740]   and there are people traveling and experiencing jet lag
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.400]   where this is not gonna be the case.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.140]   We are gonna deal with jet lag and shift work
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.040]   at the end of this podcast.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.840]   But for most people, we tend to wake up
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.380]   about the time that the sun is rising or so.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.320]   And as we do that, adenosine levels tend to be low
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.120]   if we've been asleep for reasons that you now understand
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.380]   and our system generates an internal signal
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.400]   that is in the form of a hormone.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.540]   Now I've talked a lot about neuromodulators
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.460]   and neurotransmitters.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.480]   I haven't talked a lot about hormones yet on this podcast.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.220]   The definition of a hormone is it's a substance,
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.060]   a chemical that's released from one organ in your body
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.760]   that goes and acts on other organs elsewhere in your body,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.980]   including your nervous system.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.700]   When you wake up in the morning,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.360]   you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.660]   is released from your adrenal glands.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.780]   Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.000]   and there's a little pulse of cortisol.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.120]   There's also a pulse of some, and when I say a pulse,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.400]   I just mean that the release of a little bit.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.360]   There's also a pulse of epinephrine,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.280]   which is adrenaline from your adrenals
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.600]   and also in your brain and you feel awake.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.320]   Now that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.520]   and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.160]   It might come from you naturally waking up,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.440]   but it tends to alert your whole system in your body
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.040]   that it's time to increase your heart rate.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.560]   It's time to start tensing your muscles.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.960]   It's time to start moving about.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.040]   It's very important that that cortisol pulse
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.120]   come early in the day
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.880]   or at least early in your period of wakefulness.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.720]   I say that because some people are waking up at 8 p.m.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.200]   and are sleeping all day,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.400]   but it's very important that that pulse of cortisol
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.040]   occur early in the day
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.120]   and that it happens all at once.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.100]   It sort of sets a rising tide of cortisol in your system.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.460]   Now, many of you have probably heard about cortisol
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.880]   in relation to stress.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.840]   And indeed, as we go through our day and our life,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.120]   different stressors, different events happen in our life
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.160]   that make us feel more alert.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.440]   Some of the more stressful ones
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   might be looking at your credit card bill
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.680]   and seeing what seems to be a fraudulent charge
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.380]   or looking at your phone and suddenly seeing a text
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.760]   that something you thought was gonna happen
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.340]   in a particular time is not gonna happen
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.580]   or you're running late.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.960]   Those will tend to increase norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.920]   and adrenaline in your system.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.480]   And if they're severe enough,
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.000]   you'll start getting some pulses of cortisol
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.400]   released from your adrenals throughout the day.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.240]   But there's this normal, healthy, rising tide of cortisol
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.560]   that happens early in the day.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880]   And I say healthy because it wakes you up.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   It makes you feel alert.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.760]   It makes you feel able to move and wanting to move
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.400]   and to go out about your day for work, for exercise,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.680]   for school, for social relations, et cetera.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.600]   So when you wake up in the morning
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.720]   is when that cortisol pulse takes off
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.980]   and something else important happens.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.840]   A timer is set in your body and in your nervous system
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   that dictates when a different hormone called melatonin,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.920]   which makes you sleepy,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.700]   will be secreted from a particular brain region.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.680]   So let's talk about that.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.800]   When you wake up in the morning
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.000]   and you experience that rise in cortisol,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.560]   there's a timer that starts going,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.040]   and these are cellular timers,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.740]   and they're dictated by the relation
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.620]   between different organs in your body
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.200]   that says to your brain and body
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.400]   that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone,
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.320]   this hormone we're calling melatonin,
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.280]   will be released from your pineal gland.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.680]   So there's two mechanisms here,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.400]   a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.200]   And the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.280]   for the sleepiness signal.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.560]   Now that sleepiness signal that we call melatonin
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.920]   that's released from the pineal comes only from the pineal.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.120]   Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   you're supplementing with melatonin,
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.880]   the only source of melatonin in your body
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.900]   is going to be this pineal gland.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.480]   So let's talk about the pineal gland for a second.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.920]   The pineal gland is a gland that sits
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.720]   kind of in the little structure
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.460]   for the aficionados out there.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.560]   It's kind of near the fourth ventricle.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.400]   It's about the size of a pea.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   Descartes, the philosopher,
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.280]   said that the pineal was the seat of the soul.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.120]   He said that because it's one of the few structures
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.680]   in the human brain that there's only one of them.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   Most structures, there's one on either side of the brain,
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   so-called bihemispheric, but the pineal, there's only one.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.080]   I don't know anything about souls really,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.800]   certainly not the science of souls,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.320]   but I think it's very unlikely
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.840]   that the pineal is the seat of the soul,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.200]   but it is a very interesting organ
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.520]   because it's the only organ in our body
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.360]   that releases melatonin,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.160]   and that melatonin makes us sleepy and lets us fall asleep.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.360]   Now, I'm guessing that many of you are probably asking,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.460]   should I take melatonin?
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   My personal bias on this is, except in rare cases, no,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.960]   for the following reason.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.200]   Melatonin has a second function,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.900]   which is that melatonin also suppresses the onset of puberty.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.800]   In kids, and especially in babies,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.400]   melatonin isn't just released in the evening,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.200]   12 to 16 hours after we wake.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.840]   Melatonin is released chronically or tonically
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.600]   throughout the day and night,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.340]   and that chronic or tonic release of melatonin
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.680]   is known to suppress some of the other hormones
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.120]   in other regions of the brain
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.240]   that trigger the onset of puberty.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.520]   Now, if you or your child has been taking melatonin,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.880]   don't freak out.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.720]   As always, any kind of supplement
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.220]   or anything that you're going to take
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.900]   or think about taking,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.920]   you really need to consult with your doctor.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.800]   I've said this many times on this podcast,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.640]   and it's in the show notes, et cetera,
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.560]   but before you remove anything or add anything
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.960]   to what you're already doing,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.460]   please do consult with a healthcare professional.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.460]   However, melatonin is known to suppress the onset of puberty,
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.000]   so much so that regular cyclic cycled periods
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.040]   of melatonin release from the pineal
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.260]   really correlate with the onset of puberty
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.000]   and early adulthood,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.760]   meaning as we start secreting melatonin only at night,
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   that's also when we tend to transition out of puberty.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.160]   Now, there are a lot of things that correlate
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.040]   in our nervous system,
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.120]   so it doesn't necessarily mean it controls it,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.360]   but in this case, we know based on lots of data,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.040]   endocrinology and so forth,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.160]   that melatonin suppresses the onset of puberty.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.760]   So supplementing melatonin could be problematic
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.360]   for that reason,
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.080]   but if you've already gone through puberty,
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.400]   it could also have some impact
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.500]   on other hormone systems in your body.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.460]   So that's why I personally don't like
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.040]   to use melatonin to fall asleep.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.880]   There's another reason,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.840]   which is that melatonin will help you fall asleep,
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.680]   but it won't help you stay asleep,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.420]   and many people who take melatonin find that they wake up
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.760]   three to five hours later, unable to fall back asleep.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.140]   Part of the reason for that might be
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.760]   that melatonin purchased,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.440]   you can buy it over the counter in most areas of the world,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.260]   even though it's a hormone, which is a little unusual,
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.540]   you can't just go into a pharmacy, at least in the US,
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.380]   and buy testosterone or cortisol or estrogen,
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.360]   you need a prescription,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.540]   but you can go buy melatonin for whatever reason,
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.720]   I don't know the reasons for that legality,
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.900]   but it's been shown many times,
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.400]   and now I'm borrowing from some items
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.080]   that were in Matt Walker's book, "Why We Sleep,"
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.760]   where he stated there is evidence
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.200]   that in commercially available melatonin,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.560]   the amount of melatonin has been tested for various brands,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.540]   and it can range anywhere from being 15%
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.840]   of what's listed on the bottle,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.880]   so if they list up, this is 100 milligrams,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.920]   would be a tremendously high dose,
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.120]   it turns out it's only 15 milligrams
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.420]   in that particular pill or capsule,
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.980]   or up to 400 times more than what's listed on the bottle,
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.800]   so it's completely unregulated,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.000]   and so for those of you taking melatonin,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.700]   I will discuss at the end of the podcast
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.760]   some other potential alternatives that are probably safer
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.580]   and don't have these issues,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.960]   so should you take melatonin?
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.020]   My personal bias is no, but for many people,
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.480]   they find that it does help them,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.000]   and so if you do find it helps you,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.760]   then just consider what I'm saying
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.180]   in light of the other practices that you're doing
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.120]   and talk to your healthcare professional.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.440]   Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.080]   is what we call endogenous,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.140]   it's happening in us all the time
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.040]   without any external input,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.400]   in fact, if we were in complete darkness,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.520]   living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever,
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.220]   or we were in complete brightness,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.120]   where we never experienced any darkness,
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.040]   you would have a bump in cortisol or a pulse in cortisol
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.480]   that would drop off with time,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.140]   and then melatonin would come up
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.240]   about 12 to 14 hours later,
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.360]   but these endogenous systems of our body,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.600]   which are both hormonal and neural,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.900]   were set so that external things
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.880]   could govern when they happen.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.100]   Now, this takes us back to episode one of the podcast
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.680]   that if you haven't listened to already,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.720]   you might wanna listen to,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.320]   where we talked about sensation and perception and all that,
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.240]   I'm not gonna review it again here,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.060]   but there's one particular sensory event,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.960]   one particular influence on your nervous system
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.040]   that determines when that cortisol
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.320]   is going to start to rise.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.520]   So if you were in complete darkness,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.600]   it would happen once per 24 hour cycle,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.280]   but it would be somewhat later and later each day,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.540]   whereas under normal circumstances,
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.840]   what happens is you wake up,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   and what happens when you wake up?
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.000]   You open your eyes.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.400]   When you open your eyes, light comes into your eyes.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.140]   Now, the way this system works
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.820]   is that you have a particular set of neurons in your eye,
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.440]   they're called retinal ganglion cells.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.780]   You don't have to remember that if you don't want to,
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.380]   but these retinal ganglion cells are brain neurons.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.120]   Again, the retina is just the one piece of your brain,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.960]   actually two pieces,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.860]   'cause most of you have two retinas,
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.880]   that resides outside the skull per se.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.560]   When light comes into the eye,
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.580]   there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.920]   or type of retinal ganglion cells
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.120]   that perceives a particular type of light
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   and communicates that to this clock that resides
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.020]   right above the roof of your mouth,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.360]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.960]   So I know this can get a little complicated,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.420]   but these retinal ganglion cells,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.740]   when you open your eyes, light comes in,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.800]   and an electrical signal is sent to this central clock
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.080]   we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.180]   and the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.800]   with essentially every cell and organ of your body.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.680]   Now, it's vitally important that we get light
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.880]   communicated to this central clock
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.760]   When I say properly, I can say that with confidence,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.280]   because we know based on a lot of evidence
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.680]   that if you don't get your cortisol
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.000]   and melatonin rhythms right,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   there are tremendously broad and bad effects
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.800]   on cardiovascular health, dementia, metabolic effects,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.520]   learning, depression, dementia.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.000]   In fact, there's so many negative effects associated
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.600]   with getting this wrong
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.320]   that I don't want to go into it in too much detail.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.220]   In fact, I feel like we've been bombarded
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.500]   with all this information about how we're not sleeping well,
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.700]   we're not sleeping at the right times,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.880]   we're not sleeping enough,
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   to the point where people now have sleep anxiety.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.660]   If they can't sleep well for a night,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.200]   they're feeling overwhelmed by that,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.520]   and it's sort of now they're stressed
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.700]   about not being able to sleep,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.120]   which is making it harder to sleep, et cetera.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.520]   I really want to focus on what we can do
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.880]   to anchor these systems properly.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.160]   So let's think about what happens when we do this correctly
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.580]   and how to do it correctly.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.840]   When we wake up, our eyes open.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240]   Now, if we're in a dark room,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.320]   there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.340]   of this cortisol melatonin thing, these rhythms.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.420]   You might say, well, why won't any light do it?
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.660]   Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.320]   that set the circadian clock
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.300]   and then allow our circadian clock to set all the clocks
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.980]   of all the cells and organs and tissues of our body
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.420]   responds best to a particular quality of light
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.740]   and amount of light.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.320]   And those are the qualities of light
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.380]   and amount of light that come from sunlight.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.080]   So these neurons, what they're really looking for,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.040]   although they don't have a mind of their own,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.460]   is the sun at what we call low solar angle.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.100]   The eye and the nervous system don't know anything
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.900]   about sunrises or sunsets.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.360]   It only knows the quality of light that comes in
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.940]   when the sun is low in the sky.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.880]   The system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.980]   there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.460]   that triggers the activation of these cells.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.080]   So if you wake up and you look at your phone
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.820]   or your computer, or you flip on a bunch
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.940]   of artificial lights, will these cells be activated?
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.620]   And the answer is sort of.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.960]   They'll be activated, but not in the optimal way.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.560]   What you want to do is get sunlight in your eyes
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.920]   as close to waking as possible.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.360]   Now, I wanna be really clear about this
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.880]   'cause I've talked about it on other podcasts
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.400]   when I was a guest, and I've talked about it
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.580]   on my Instagram feed, and there seemed to be
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.200]   the same questions coming up again and again.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.100]   These neurons don't know sunlight per se.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.400]   They don't know sunrise or sunset for that matter.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.540]   They don't know artificial light from sunlight.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.340]   What they respond best to, however,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.060]   is the quality and amount of light that comes in
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.140]   when the sun is low in the sky.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.540]   That means that if you can watch the sunrise, great.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.980]   That's perfect for triggering activation of these cells.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.180]   However, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.100]   which I tend to most days personally,
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.820]   you still wanna get outside and view sunlight.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.660]   You don't need the sunlight beaming you
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.780]   directly in the eyes.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.140]   There's a lot of photons, light energy,
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.740]   that's scattered from sunlight at this time.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.460]   But the key is to get that light energy
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.040]   from sunlight ideally into your eyes.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.140]   Now, I know many of you are already asking,
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.980]   well, I live in Scandinavia or I can't get sunlight.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.640]   There's buildings around me, et cetera.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.700]   We will get to all of that.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.940]   But it's critically important that you get outside
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.460]   to get this light.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.340]   I had a discussion with a colleague of mine,
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.700]   Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in the Department of Psychiatry
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.500]   and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   And he tells me that it's 50 times less effective
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.540]   to view the sunlight through a window,
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.160]   through a car windshield or through a side window of a car,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.180]   than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.740]   and view light early in the day.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.140]   Now, if you can't see the sunrise, like I said,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.500]   you can see this within an hour or two of sunrise,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.120]   but it has to be low solar angle.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.540]   Once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.620]   so that you miss this opportunity
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.500]   to time the cortisol pulse.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.960]   And that turns out to be a bad thing to do.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.140]   You really wanna time that cortisol pulse properly
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.320]   because we'll get into this a little bit more later,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.460]   but a late shifted cortisol pulse,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.500]   in particular in 9 p.m. or 8 p.m. increase in cortisol,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.500]   is one of the consequences and maybe one of the causes
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.480]   of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.620]   So it's kind of a chicken egg thing.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.600]   We don't know whether or not it's the correlated with,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.560]   it's the cause or the effect,
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.840]   but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.680]   Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period,
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.960]   earlier in your day, has positive benefits
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.480]   ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.520]   I'm not gonna list them all off
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.200]   'cause there's just so many of them,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.400]   but many, many positive things happen
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.580]   when you are getting the cortisol early in the day,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.360]   far away from your melatonin pulse.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.060]   Okay, so how long should you be outside?
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.260]   Well, this is gonna vary tremendously
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.840]   because some people live in environments
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.680]   where it's very bright.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.520]   So let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.520]   there's a snow field, there's no cloud cover,
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.000]   and you walk outside.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.180]   There's going to be so much photon light energy
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.680]   arriving on your retina
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.820]   that it probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.440]   to trigger the central clock
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.080]   and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.120]   and get everything lined up nicely.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.960]   Whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.160]   and you wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.720]   and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.160]   then goes back down again a few hours later,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.880]   you probably are not getting enough sunlight
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.220]   in order to set these rhythms.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:27.200]   So many people find that they need to use sunlight simulators
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.040]   in the form of particular lights
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.800]   that were designed to simulate sunlight.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.600]   However, I'm not out to attack the companies
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.880]   that produce those.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.760]   There's another solution to that.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.040]   You can simply go outside for longer.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.240]   Even if there's a lot of dense cloud cover,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.600]   you're probably getting anywhere
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.360]   from 10,000 to 50,000 lux, L-U-X,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.520]   which is just a measure of light energy.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.140]   And that should be sufficient to set the circadian clock.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.420]   You could say, well, the lights in my house or my phone
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.920]   are really, really bright, right?
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.700]   Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.240]   because they're really bright.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.120]   But guess what?
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.320]   It turns out that early in the day,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.240]   your retina is not very sensitive,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.120]   which means you need a lot of photons,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.520]   ideally coming from sunlight,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.280]   to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.080]   So looking at your phone or artificial lights
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.840]   is fine if you wake up before sunrise,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.160]   but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.660]   And this is supported by dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.120]   of quality peer-reviewed studies.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.640]   So you want to use sunlight.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.800]   If you can't see sunlight because of your environment,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.120]   then you are going to have to opt for artificial light.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.640]   And in that case, you're going to want an artificial light
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.040]   that either simulates sunlight or has a lot of blue light.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.800]   Now, without going off course here,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.920]   you might be saying,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.880]   wait, I've heard blue light is bad for me.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.920]   Actually, blue light is great
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.720]   for this mechanism during the day.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.060]   We can talk about blue light and blue blockers,
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.120]   but you really want a lot of blue and yellow light
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.020]   arriving on the retina early in the day.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.820]   Let me be clear about something.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.280]   You never ever want to look at any light,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.980]   sunlight or artificial light, that is painful to look at.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.740]   If you find that your eyes are watering
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.660]   or you're having challenges maintaining,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.140]   looking at this thing for a while because it's painful,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   that light is too bright
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.020]   and you do not want to damage your retina.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.180]   So you don't want to gaze at the sun,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.840]   refusing to blink and burn your retina.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.080]   That's actually possible to do.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.360]   You don't want to do that.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.040]   You have a proper blink reflex installed in you since birth.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.980]   And if you feel like something's too bright
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.660]   and you need to blink, it means you need to blink,
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.780]   that it's too much light.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.820]   So please don't beam your eyes with really bright light.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.300]   But blue light, in particular,
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.980]   blue light and yellow light coming from sunlight is ideal.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.040]   If you're going to get it from artificial light
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.600]   because you can't get enough sunlight,
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.380]   well, then artificial lights that are rich in blue,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.600]   blue wavelengths are going to be ideal
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.320]   for setting this mechanism.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.160]   A lot of people will say,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.240]   "Oh, I should be wearing blue blockers throughout the day."
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.960]   No, that's the exact wrong thing.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.560]   If you're going to use blue blockers, we can talk about that.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.360]   That should be reserved for late in the evening
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.660]   because light suppresses melatonin.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.880]   I've been asked many times before about this pineal gland.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.400]   And there are a lot of ancient practices
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.040]   that map to some of the things that I'm saying.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.880]   And people always say,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.680]   "Oh, I heard that sunlight is great for the pineal."
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.360]   Well, perhaps, but we have to be careful about that phrase.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.160]   Sunlight inhibits the pineal.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.260]   It prevents it from releasing melatonin.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.160]   Darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.960]   So the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.860]   It is the gland of darkness.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.240]   In fact, melatonin can be thought of
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.940]   as a sleepiness signal that's correlated with darkness.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.040]   So get up each morning, try and get outside.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.680]   I know that can be challenging for people,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.080]   but anywhere from two to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.840]   is going to work well for most people.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.680]   And you want to do this on a regular basis
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.600]   and you don't have to do it exactly at sunrise.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.180]   I realize I'm repeating myself,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.340]   but somehow, despite barking at people about this
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.960]   for a couple of years now,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.400]   I keep getting the same questions
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.660]   and somehow it hasn't been sinking in,
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.800]   which could be related to some circadian disorder.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.640]   I'm just kidding.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.000]   If it's not sinking in, it's probably
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.200]   that I'm not being effective
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.680]   in communicating the information.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640]   But get that bright light early in the day from sunlight.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.860]   And if you can't get it from sunlight,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.220]   get it from artificial light.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.000]   What kinds of artificial lights will work?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.140]   Well, there are these sunrise simulators,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.280]   but the ring lights that people use for selfies
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.800]   and this sort of thing for posting on Instagram,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.100]   those generate a lot of blue light.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.080]   If you want to get experimental about this,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   there's a free app.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.680]   I have no relationship to the app,
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.840]   but it's a great app called Light Meter
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.620]   that you can use your phone
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.080]   and you can measure the amount of photon energy
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.120]   in your environment.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.400]   And it's kind of a fun experiment to do.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.640]   You can go outside in the morning
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.180]   and you'll see that there's 10,000, 20,000 lux,
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.120]   even though it might seem like it's kind of dim
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.740]   or there's tree cover or cloud cover.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.080]   You go inside and you shine
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.680]   that artificial light at your phone,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.140]   press the button on Light Meter,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.040]   and you'll find that it's only 500 or 1,000 lux.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.360]   And you realize that even though it seems really bright,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.880]   the artificial light is very condensed,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.400]   whereas the outside light is scattered in the atmosphere.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.440]   And so you can think that you're not getting much sunlight,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.080]   but you're actually getting much more outside.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.280]   So get outside, get that sunlight early in the day
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.240]   and try and do it on a consistent basis.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.400]   If you can't do it every day
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.780]   or you sleep through this period of the early day,
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.220]   low solar angle, don't worry about it.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.600]   The systems in the body,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.140]   these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.640]   that make you awake at certain periods of the day
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.560]   and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.080]   when you view the brightest light.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.860]   Now, that can immediately tell us
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.680]   that what most people are doing is terrible.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.520]   They're waking up and they're looking at their phone,
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.280]   which isn't triggering activation of these cells in the eye
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.000]   and the central circadian clock.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.080]   Then a few hours later,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.460]   they might get in their car with sunglasses and drive.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.280]   Now, a note about sunglasses and prescription lenses.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.320]   Absolutely never, ever, ever compromise safety
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.960]   for the sorts of things I'm talking about.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.260]   So if you need to wear sunglasses for safety reasons,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.280]   wear them.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.160]   Absolutely, if you wear prescription lenses or contacts,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.720]   wear them, they won't filter out the wavelengths of light
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.100]   that are necessary for setting these central clocks.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.160]   So safety first, of course.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.440]   If you have a retinal degenerative disorder,
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.320]   retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration or glaucoma,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.380]   or those run in your family,
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.660]   you want to avoid excessively bright light all the time.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.300]   You want to be very cautious about that.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.380]   You're going to want to get your light exposure
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.780]   by through seeing dimmer light, including sunlight,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   but for longer periods of time, perhaps.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.260]   You might immediately ask,
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.800]   what about low vision or blind people?
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.340]   How do they set these central clocks?
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.980]   Well, it turns out that low vision and blind people,
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.260]   most of them, provided they still have eyes,
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.540]   that the eyes weren't removed because of a burn or tumor
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.660]   or something like that,
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.780]   still maintain these neurons that set the circadian clock,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.260]   which brings me to a really important point.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.720]   It's not about seeing and perceiving the sun.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.580]   This is a subconscious mechanism by which these neurons,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.860]   which are called melanopsin ganglion cells,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.580]   these neurons set your central clocks
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.060]   by getting activated by the particular wavelengths of light
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.540]   that are present in the atmosphere,
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.000]   even coming through cloud cover,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.180]   and you don't need to see or perceive the sun
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.580]   in order to get this mechanism to start.
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.540]   Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.100]   because it dictates how well and what time
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.260]   you will want to fall asleep later in the day.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.860]   So for those of you that are night owls
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.380]   and you insist that you're a night owl
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.100]   and you have the genetic polymorphism
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.080]   that makes you a night owl,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.820]   you may very well have that genetic polymorphism,
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.900]   those genes that make you want to stay up late
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.660]   and wake up late.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.360]   But chances are about half of you
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.940]   that think that your night owls
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.840]   are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.380]   So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.480]   is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.400]   and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.740]   Now, it's not gonna make sure
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.640]   that all that happens every single time,
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.200]   but it is the foundation of proper sleep
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.420]   and what we call circadian health.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.600]   It governs metabolism and so many other things
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.160]   that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.140]   Some of you, many of you might be asking,
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.940]   what else can help set this rhythm?
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.480]   Well, it turns out that light
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.960]   is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver,
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.140]   but other things can help establish this rhythm
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.940]   of cortisol followed by melatonin
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.480]   12 to 16 hours later as well.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.020]   The other things besides light are timing of food intake,
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:01.380]   timing of exercise, as well as various drugs
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.440]   or chemicals that one might ingest, not illegal drugs,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.300]   although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.520]   But the reason we focus so heavily on light
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.520]   is that light is the main way that the central clock,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.960]   the suprachiasmatic nucleus, was supposed to be set.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.440]   We know that because it's the only direct input to the clock.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.560]   These neurons in the eye that are also part of the brain
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.720]   that we call melanopsin ganglion cells
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.240]   that not so incidentally were discovered
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.100]   by my friend and colleague, David Berson
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.700]   at Brown University and others,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.340]   Samir Hatar, King Wayao, et cetera,
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.500]   worked out the mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms,
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.520]   but it was really David Berson
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.400]   that discovered these incredibly fascinating non...
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.520]   These are cells that aren't important for sight
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.940]   like pattern vision, but are for setting our clocks.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.040]   David's really credited with making that discovery.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.580]   Those cells are the main way
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.460]   and the only direct way to set the clock.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.620]   In fact, it's fair to say that light
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.600]   viewed by these melanopsin cells, particular sunlight,
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.460]   is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.040]   than say getting up in darkness and just exercising.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.600]   That doesn't mean that you shouldn't exercise
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.040]   early in the day in darkness if that's what you like to do.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.320]   It will have somewhat an effect
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.080]   on raising your wakefulness early in the day
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.600]   and setting these rhythms.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.440]   And this is because of some other pathways.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.040]   For the aficionados out there
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.860]   who want to know more neuroscience, here's how it goes.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.880]   You've got this clock above the roof of your mouth
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.680]   that churns out this 24-hour rhythm
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.600]   and is communicated to all the other organs
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.120]   and tissues of your body.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.560]   But there's another structure, has a cool name.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.840]   It's called the intergeniculate leaflet,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.280]   which sits a few millimeters away in the brain.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.540]   And it's involved in regulating the clock output
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.640]   through what's called non-photic, non-light type influences
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.420]   like exercise and feeding, et cetera.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.360]   So if you are not feeling awake during the day
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.160]   and you're having trouble sleeping,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.120]   get the sunlight exposure that we just talked about.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.140]   But in addition to that,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.500]   if you want to become an early riser, for instance,
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.540]   and you want to feel more awake
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.160]   during the early part of the day,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.440]   by getting that light exposure
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.960]   and exercising early in the day,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.220]   you will, after two or three days,
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.640]   you will naturally start to wake up earlier in the day.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.520]   And that's because these clock mechanisms
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.820]   have shifted, it's like setting the clock earlier
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.240]   as opposed to delaying the clock.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.480]   And that takes us to a somewhat complicated
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.780]   but very important aspect to all this,
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.360]   which is what sets the clock and keeps it anchored.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.520]   The main thing is that bright light early in the day.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.460]   The other thing is sunset.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.640]   When the sun is also at low solar angle,
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.300]   low, close to the horizon,
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.480]   by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.360]   or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.280]   and where you are in the world,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.760]   these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eye,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.940]   signal the central circadian clock
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.060]   that it's the end of the day.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.480]   And there's a really nice study
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.900]   that was published last year,
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.720]   and I will put links to these references on a website
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.820]   not too long from now.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.760]   There was a really nice study that showed
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.880]   that viewing sunlight around the time of sunset,
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.280]   doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.240]   but circa sunset, within an hour or so of sunset,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.880]   prevents some of the bad effects of light
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.800]   in preventing melatonin release later that same night.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.760]   So let me repeat this.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.280]   Viewing light early in the day is key.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.460]   Viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.920]   or around that time can help protect these mechanisms,
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.240]   your brain and body,
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.760]   against the negative effects of light later in the day.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.260]   So let me talk about how you would do that.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.600]   You'd go view the sunset,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.880]   or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.320]   Again, if you safely can do that with sunglasses off,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.600]   you will, if you need to wear sunglasses, fine,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.760]   but it will take probably 100 to 1,000 times longer
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.120]   with dark sunglasses than if you take them off.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.640]   Again, if you want to do this through a window at work,
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.040]   that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.200]   So the best thing to do is just to get outside
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.040]   for a few minutes,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.720]   anywhere from two to 10 minutes, also in the afternoon.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.100]   Having those two signals arriving to your central clock
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.540]   that your body, your internal world,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.720]   knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.980]   is tremendously powerful.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.000]   Maybe think about it this way.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.040]   Every cell in your body needs glucose and energy.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.200]   It needs, whether or not it gets that from meat
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.280]   or it gets it from ketones
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.840]   or it gets it from carbohydrates or fruit or vegetables,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.680]   doesn't matter, it is eventually converted
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.960]   into a certain form of energy that all your cells use.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.720]   But you don't take glucose,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.000]   you don't take a bread or a steak or a nice orange
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.260]   and shove it in your ear, you put it in your mouth,
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.120]   it goes into your stomach, it's digested,
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.640]   and then that resource is distributed
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.500]   to all the cells of your body.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.860]   Every cell in your body needs oxygen
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.300]   and you don't put a hose through your nostril
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.160]   or through your ear or through some other orifice
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   in your body.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.220]   You inhale air and it's then distributed via the lungs
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.320]   to the cells in your bloodstream
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.360]   and that's distributed to all the organs of your body.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.440]   Every cell and organ in your body needs light information.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.160]   And the way to get that light information to all those cells
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.480]   because you have a thick skull
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.200]   and inside of you is dark inside your skin,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.760]   there's no sunlight getting in there,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.720]   is by viewing sunlight with your eyes
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.480]   at the two times a day that I'm referring to, okay?
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.380]   That's the only route.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.000]   There was a study published in Science,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.200]   an excellent journal, well over 10 years ago,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   that showed that light shown on the back of the knee
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.140]   could set these circadian rhythms.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.640]   That study was retracted
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.080]   and unfortunately most people don't know
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.360]   that it was retracted.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.960]   There were some experimental flaws
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.460]   that people were actually viewing light through their eyes.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.720]   That study was repeated.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.400]   Turns out there is no extra ocular photoreception in humans.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.800]   Whatever somebody tells you that light to the skin
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.460]   or light to the wherever is beneficial for your health,
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.660]   we can talk about that,
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.100]   but there's no way that light information is setting
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.700]   your clocks.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.940]   You need these cells in your eyes to perceive
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.660]   or to see light at the particular times of day
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.020]   that I'm referring to.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.060]   Some animals like snakes and other reptiles
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.740]   actually have a hole in the top of their skull
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.300]   to get light information directly to their pineal
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.900]   to suppress melatonin.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.960]   We don't have that hole.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.100]   I mean, most of you don't have holes in your skull.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.700]   These holes in your skull
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.300]   that we call the sockets for the eyes
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.340]   are actually there primarily to allow light information
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.620]   to the central clock.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.660]   And then vision and pattern vision and color vision
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.540]   came much later in evolution.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.320]   We know this on the basis of genetic studies
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.100]   we get to discuss in a future podcast.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.900]   So get that light information
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.020]   to the cells of your brain and body
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.420]   by viewing sunlight at the two times a day
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.380]   that I referred to.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.260]   There's always a lot of questions about how long,
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.840]   how much, how do I know if I've had enough?
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.020]   You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.160]   into some degree of normalcy.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.580]   You'll start to wake up at more or less
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.660]   the same time each day.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.340]   You'll fall asleep more easily at night.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.040]   Generally, it takes about two or three days
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.720]   for these systems to align.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.960]   So if you've not been doing these behaviors,
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.180]   it's gonna take a few days,
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.300]   but they can have tremendous benefits
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.340]   and sometimes rather quickly on a number of different mental
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.140]   and physical aspects of your health.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.780]   Now let's talk about the bad effects of light
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.300]   because light is not supposed to arrive in our system
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.520]   at any time.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.440]   And nowadays, because of screens and artificial light,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.540]   we have access to light at times of day and night
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.560]   that normally we wouldn't.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.260]   Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   in particular sunlight to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.060]   That's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.180]   to the way all this works,
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.920]   which is the longer you've been awake,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:08.020]   the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.800]   So that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours,
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.720]   it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.440]   coming from a screen or from an overhead light
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.760]   to trigger the activation of the clock
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.560]   and make you feel like you wanna stay up late
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.880]   or make it harder to fall asleep
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.040]   and disrupt your sleep pattern.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.440]   Okay, so the simple way to think about this
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.240]   is you want as much light as is safely possible
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.600]   early in the day, morning and throughout the day,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.800]   including blue light.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.840]   So take those blue blockers off during the day,
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.820]   unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.840]   And you want as little light coming into your eyes,
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.560]   artificial or sunlight, after say 8 p.m.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.520]   And certainly you do not want to get bright light exposure
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.040]   to your eyes between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., and here's why.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.120]   David Berson, who I mentioned before,
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.280]   and another friend and colleague, Samir Hattar,
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.020]   who's director of the Chronobiology Unit
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.200]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.740]   published a paper in Cell, which is a journal,
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.920]   another excellent journal, very high stringency,
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   showing that light that arrives to the eyes
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.840]   between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., approximately,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.320]   suppresses the release of dopamine,
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.220]   this neuromodulator that makes us feel good
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.760]   as sort of an endogenous antidepressant,
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.000]   and can inhibit learning
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.600]   and create all sorts of other detrimental effects.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.280]   It does this through a mechanism,
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.440]   for those of you who want to know the neural pathways,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.880]   that involves light to the eyes
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.800]   that then signal to a structure called the habenula.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.600]   The habenula looks like two little bat ears
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.880]   sitting right in the middle of you,
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.520]   structuring your brain called the thalamus.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.600]   Don't worry about these names
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.680]   if you're not interested in this stuff.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.400]   If you are, these are just avenues to explore.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   When that habenula gets activated,
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.100]   it's actually called the disappointment nucleus,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.040]   because it actually makes us feel less happy
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.160]   and more disappointed
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.640]   and can lead to certain forms of depression
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.140]   in the wakeful state.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.400]   Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.420]   and you need to use the bathroom,
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.720]   or you're on an all-night flight
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.280]   and you need to read or whatever it is, fine.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.320]   Every once in a while,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.280]   it's not going to be a problem
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.380]   to get bright light exposure to your eyes
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.820]   in the middle of the night.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.480]   But if you think about our lifestyle nowadays
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.080]   and being up late looking at phones,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.800]   even if you dim that screen,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.660]   you're triggering this activation,
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.120]   because your retinal sensitivity
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.240]   and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.680]   late in the day.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.040]   Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.020]   but for those of you that are experiencing
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.280]   challenges with mood,
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.360]   those of you that have anxiety, learning problems,
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.160]   issues focusing,
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.320]   the questions I usually get are, how can I focus better?
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.040]   Well, we will get to that.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.020]   But one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.520]   for good mood, mental health, learning,
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.800]   focus, metabolism, et cetera,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:55.640]   is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.760]   and not get much or any bright light exposure
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.920]   in the middle of the night.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.580]   Red light won't trigger this pathway,
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.200]   but very few people have the kind of infrared lights
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.240]   that are set up or floor lights.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.120]   And that brings me to an important point,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.640]   which is about the location of light.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.560]   This hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.360]   These cells in our eye,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.200]   these neurons that signal the central clock
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.460]   reside mostly, not exclusively,
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.120]   but mostly in the bottom half of our retina.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.720]   And because we have a lens in front of our retina
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.840]   and because of the optics of lenses,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.580]   that means that these cells
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.960]   are actually viewing our upper visual field.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.480]   There's an inversion of the visual image, et cetera.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.300]   You can look that up
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.640]   if you wanna learn more about retinal optics.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.560]   It's fascinating, but not the topic for today.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.920]   These cells are in the bottom half of your retina mostly,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.920]   and so they're viewing the overhead visual space around you.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.840]   This is probably not coincidental
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.260]   that these cells were essentially designed
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.080]   to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.600]   So if you want to avoid
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.620]   improper activation of these neurons,
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.920]   it's better to place lights that you use in the evening
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.800]   low in your physical environment,
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.080]   so on desktops or even the floor,
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.600]   if you wanna go that way,
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.940]   as opposed to overhead lights.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.900]   So overhead fluorescent lights would be the worst.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.300]   That would be the worst case scenario.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.740]   Lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.000]   of the sort of yellow or reddish tints
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.040]   would be slightly better,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.660]   but dim lights that are set low in the room
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.700]   are going to be best
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.180]   because they aren't going to activate these neurons
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.140]   and therefore shift your circadian clock.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.540]   So that's a goal.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.580]   Some people like Samir Hatar that I mentioned earlier,
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.660]   he turns his home basically into a cave in the evenings.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.080]   Candlelight actually does not
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.660]   trigger activation of these cells.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:55.660]   So candlelight and fireplaces and campfires are fine.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.260]   Dim lights, very dim lights are fine,
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.000]   and lights low in the physical environment.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.660]   Of course, the problem with candlelight and fireplaces
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.260]   is the fire hazard, but you're smart people.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.620]   You know what to do about that.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.820]   Don't burn down whatever structure you're in,
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.220]   including forests, please.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.840]   So keep the lights low in your environment.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.960]   What if you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.020]   and you find yourself watching TV or on the computer?
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.780]   And well, in that case, you might want to wear blue blockers
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.060]   and you certainly would want to dim the screen,
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.580]   but ideally you're not doing that.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.620]   It's remarkable the positive effects
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.600]   of getting that bit of sunlight early in the day,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.060]   maybe even also around sunset and avoiding bright lights
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.520]   and especially overhead bright lights
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.680]   between about 11 PM and 4 AM.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.440]   Now I'm not talking about shift work.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.620]   I'm realizing that we're probably going to have to have
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.360]   an entire discussion devoted just to shift workers
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.800]   because there's some good information there
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.700]   about how they can protect themselves
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.300]   against some of the very bad health effects of shift work,
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.800]   getting light in the middle of the night.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.640]   But we rely on shift workers and they're super important
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.420]   to culture and society and the economy.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.540]   So I want to acknowledge them and let you know
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.540]   that we will do a discussion about shift work and jet lag.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.300]   But let's talk about what light can do
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.540]   in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.200]   So the way to think about this whole system,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.940]   again, is you've got adenosine building up
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.040]   depending on how long you've been awake
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.100]   and it's making you sleepy.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.780]   And then you've got the circadian mechanisms
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.460]   that are timing your wakefulness
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.060]   and timing when you want to be asleep,
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.360]   mainly through cortisol and melatonin.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.420]   But there are a bunch of other things
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.500]   that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:40.040]   Like we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.000]   than late at night.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.760]   Some people like to eat it late at night,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.660]   but if you're finding that you can't become a day person
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.980]   or a morning person, shifting your light exposure exercise
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.900]   and food intake to the daytime will help.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.720]   Some people like to stop eating around six or 8 p.m.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.880]   because of metabolic reasons
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.300]   or they're trying to maintain their weight or lose weight.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:05.640]   That's actually not supported so well by the literature.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.460]   The literature around nutrition essentially says
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.840]   that it's best to restrict your feeding
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.080]   to a certain period of each 24 hour cycle
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.140]   to not be eating around the clock.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.100]   And whether or not that's four hours or eight hours
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.560]   or 16 hours is a much lengthier discussion
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.580]   than we have time for now.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.500]   I would refer you to Sachin Panda's book,
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.580]   "The Circadian Code," which talks all about that.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.340]   He's an expert, a former colleague of mine
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.700]   from the Salk Institute in San Diego.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:33.320]   You can explore intermittent and circadian fasting,
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.540]   so to speak, through Sachin's literature.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.380]   We'll talk about that.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.540]   We might even get Sachin in here
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.820]   if we're lucky at some point in the future.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.340]   But you can actually use light to wake up earlier.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.400]   Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   showing that if you turn on the lights before waking up,
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.820]   so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up,
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.340]   even if your eyelids are closed,
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.640]   provided you're not under the covers,
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.720]   after doing that for a few days,
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.420]   that increases your total sleep time
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:07.360]   and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.700]   It makes you want to go to bed earlier each night.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.160]   Now, in a kind of a diabolical way,
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.720]   they did this with teenagers who are notorious
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.480]   for wanting to wake up late and stay up late.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.920]   And what they found was bright light flashes,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.400]   just turning on the lights in their environment,
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.800]   overhead lights, 'cause they're trying
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.040]   to activate the system,
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.480]   and that's why they're using overhead lights.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.080]   Even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.640]   then made those kids naturally want to go to bed earlier
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.180]   and they ended up sleeping longer.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:35.200]   So that's something you could try.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.600]   You could put your lights on a timer to go on early
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.960]   in the day before you wake up.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.240]   You could open your blind so that sunlight is coming through.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.560]   And again, if you curl up under the covers,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.280]   then it's not going to reach these neurons,
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.380]   but it's remarkable the light can actually penetrate
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.080]   the eyelids, activate these neurons,
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.480]   and go to the central clock.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.920]   That study illustrates a really important principle
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.040]   of how you're built, which is you have the capacity
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.000]   for what are called phase advances and phase delays.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.160]   And I don't want to complicate this too much.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.480]   So the simplest way to think about phase advances
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.480]   and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day,
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.880]   and in particular in the middle of the night,
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.300]   your brain and body, for reasons that now you understand,
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.400]   will think that that's morning light,
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.540]   even though it's not sunlight,
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.120]   because you have this heightened sensitivity,
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.880]   and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.000]   It will essentially make you want to get up later
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.740]   and go to sleep later.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.520]   So if you get light exposure too late in the evening
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.900]   or in the middle of the night,
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.140]   it's going to make it hard to want to wake up
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.800]   the next morning early and to go to bed early.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.940]   The opposite is also true.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:51.900]   If you wake up early, say, 6 a.m. or 7 a.m.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.960]   and get light exposure, or even earlier, 4 a.m.,
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.080]   and get light exposure, it will phase advance your clock.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.580]   It's going to make your clock think it's earlier,
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.360]   and you'll want to wake up earlier.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.680]   So the simple way to think about this
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.840]   is if you're having trouble waking up early
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.660]   and feeling alert early in the day,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.260]   you're going to want to try and get bright light exposure
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.520]   even before waking up, because it will advance your clock.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.180]   It's sort of like turning the clock forward.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.680]   Whereas if you are having trouble waking up early,
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.880]   you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.360]   or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.220]   and in the middle of the night,
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.140]   because it's just going to delay your clock more and more.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.420]   So rather than get into the specifics
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.680]   of everybody's situation,
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.040]   because there are many of you out there
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   with different situations and lifestyle requirements,
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.960]   et cetera, the way to think about this
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.220]   is that you have these internal mechanisms
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.960]   of adenosine and circadian clocks,
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.580]   and they're always operating.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.420]   And what you're trying to do is provide them anchors.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.860]   You're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.240]   so that your cortisol, your melatonin,
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.420]   and then everything that cascades down from that,
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.140]   like your metabolism and your ability to learn
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.220]   and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin,
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.580]   all that stuff is timed regularly.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   One of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:19.980]   with focus and anxiety and depression,
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.260]   there are a lot of reasons for that,
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.380]   but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.640]   aren't anchored to anything regular.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.620]   Now, this doesn't require being neurotically attached
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.380]   to getting up at a very specific time,
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.220]   going outside, viewing the sunlight, same time every day.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.760]   These systems, again, will average,
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.860]   but if you can provide them consistent light anchors
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.760]   early in the day and in the evening
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.320]   and avoiding light at night,
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.700]   you will be amazed at the tremendous number
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.980]   of positive effects that can come from that
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   at the level of metabolic factors, hormones,
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.420]   and just general feelings of wellbeing.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.300]   In fact, most of us are familiar
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.340]   with what it is to not sleep well
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.960]   and all the terrible effects that has.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.180]   Maybe one night you're fine,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.220]   two nights even for the new parents out there,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.120]   I sympathize with you,
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.540]   but most people are not familiar with what it is
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.380]   to sleep really, really well on a consistent basis.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.140]   And when you start doing that
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.000]   by controlling your sleep environment, right,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.780]   get the proper sleep surface, get the proper pillow,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.800]   get the temperature in the room right,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.760]   get your light exposure right,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.720]   start timing your exercise at normal periods or times
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.760]   throughout the day and week.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.320]   It's amazing how many other biological systems
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.080]   just naturally fall in line.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.800]   And this is why whenever people ask me,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.760]   "What should I take?"
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.380]   Which is one of the most common questions I get,
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.520]   "What supplements should I take?
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.680]   What drugs should I be taking?
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.280]   What things should I be taking?"
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.280]   The first question I always ask them is, "How's your sleep?"
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.560]   And 90% of the time they tell me
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.760]   they either have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.400]   or they don't feel rested throughout the day.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.600]   A brief note about naps.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.600]   Naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.540]   provided they're 20 minutes or 30 minutes or even an hour,
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.600]   can be very beneficial for a lot of people.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.240]   You don't have to take them,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.020]   but many people naturally feel a dip in energy
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.600]   and focus late in the afternoon.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.760]   In fact, if we were gonna look at wakefulness,
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   what we would find is that
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.440]   you get that morning light exposure, hopefully,
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.520]   your cortisol goes up, people start feeling awake,
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.840]   and then around two or three or four in the afternoon,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.420]   there's a spike in everything from alertness
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.420]   to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop,
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.560]   and then it just naturally comes back up,
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.200]   and then it tapers off as the night goes on.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.720]   So for some of you, naps are great.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.320]   I love taking naps.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.400]   Some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.320]   That's probably because they're not sleeping as well
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.720]   as they should at night or as long as they should at night,
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.340]   and so they're dropping into REM sleep
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.120]   or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.240]   And then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.860]   Other people feel great after a nap.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.440]   So that's another case where just like with caffeine,
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.960]   you sort of have to evaluate for yourself.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.600]   As we discuss this, you're probably realizing
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.120]   this is a lot like nutrition,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.680]   where nowadays it's just crazy.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.200]   I mean, if you go on social media,
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.320]   it's like you've got people who are pushing carnivore,
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.260]   you've got other people who are pushing vegan,
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.040]   other people who are pushing paleo,
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.000]   every variation of every diet,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.920]   and there's a lot of data to support any and all of those,
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.320]   and the arguments go on and on.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.480]   And there's probably a lot of genetic variation
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.880]   and lifestyle variation that's going to dictate
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.440]   whether or not something is good for you,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.280]   whether or not you like it,
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.000]   whether or not you'll stick to it.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.800]   The same thing is true for circadian
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.640]   and sleep and wakefulness behaviors,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.360]   except the light viewing behavior
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.380]   that I talked about before.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.320]   There's no way around that.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   That's hardwired into our system.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.200]   The same way we could factually say
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.720]   that everybody needs some nutrition
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.560]   at some level from some source,
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.160]   everybody needs light information arriving in their system
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.640]   in some way at regular intervals.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.040]   So that's really what this is about.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.960]   Okay, so naps are going to be good for some people,
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.800]   not for others.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.240]   I have a colleague, a very accomplished neuroscientist
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.800]   who likes to take naps just after lunch.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.080]   I personally like to take a nap around three or 4 p.m.,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.200]   but there's a practice that I've adopted
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.800]   in the last five years
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.340]   that I've found to be immensely beneficial
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.280]   that is sort of like napping, but isn't napping.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.720]   It's a thing that they call yoga nidra.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.960]   Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.760]   And it's a sort of meditation that you listen to.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   There are a number of scripts.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.420]   I've talked about this on podcasts before,
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:29.680]   but I'm going to post a link to the two that I like most
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.680]   that allows you to consciously bring your entire body
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.080]   and mind into a state of deep relaxation.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.160]   And sometimes you fall asleep and sometimes you don't.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.120]   This is done for 10 to 30 or even 60 minutes at a time.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.240]   The other thing that works really well is meditation.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.120]   So I'm talking about naps,
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.680]   but I'm also talking about yoga nidra,
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.480]   which is sort of a form of meditation,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.440]   and then more standard forms of meditation.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.140]   All three of those do something powerful,
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.960]   which is that they bring our mind into a state
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.000]   of less so-called sympathetic nervous system activation.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.680]   Go back and listen to episode one
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.840]   if that doesn't make any sense,
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.440]   which is what governs your alertness.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.440]   And instead it activates cells and circuits in your body
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.940]   that promote the parasympathetic nervous system
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.680]   or the calming system.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.880]   A lot of people are not good at falling asleep
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.780]   because they're not good at calming down.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.160]   So some people have no trouble falling asleep,
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.600]   but many people have a hard time falling asleep
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.040]   or at least every once in a while
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.280]   experience challenges falling asleep.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.040]   I don't have problems falling asleep most nights,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.100]   but I've noticed that if I'm working very hard
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.000]   or if the world is particularly stressful,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.360]   my mind gets into a bit of a kind of OCD loop
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.820]   where I tend to ruminate on things.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.800]   And I'm not even thinking about anything in particular.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.160]   It's just challenging for me to disengage and fall asleep.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.560]   Meditation and yoga nidra scripts
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   have been immensely helpful for me
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.880]   in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.720]   So they involve taking a few minutes,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.480]   10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap,
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.520]   and just listening to a script almost passively.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.680]   And it has you do some particular patterns of breathing
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.560]   and some other kind of body scan-like things
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.120]   that can really help people learn to relax,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.640]   not just in that moment,
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.480]   but get better at relaxing and turning off thinking
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.680]   in order to fall asleep when they want to do that at night.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.320]   There's another thing that's similar to this,
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.000]   which is certain forms of hypnosis for sleep.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.820]   For that, I'll just refer you to the website
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.600]   of a colleague and collaborator of mine, David Spiegel,
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.040]   who's our Associate Chair of Psychiatry
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.560]   and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.200]   He's developed a website, which is reverie,
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com, so reveriehealth.com,
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.260]   that has a lot of science-supported,
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.320]   clinically-supported hypnosis scripts
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.680]   that essentially take the brain
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.100]   into states of deep relaxation
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.820]   for sake of rewiring the brain and neuroplasticity.
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.400]   But one of those scripts that's there
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.880]   and is available free is for sleep.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.940]   And we'll talk more about hypnosis at a later time
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.280]   because it has a ton of other effects
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.200]   that aren't just limited to sleep.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.160]   So a period of time each day that you devote
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.400]   to getting better at falling and staying asleep
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.080]   is actually a really good practice to adopt.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.560]   The other thing about these practices
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.760]   like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.160]   is people always say to me, "Well, when should I do them?"
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.120]   And I always say, "Well, the best time of day to do it
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.040]   is when you first wake up in the morning,
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.440]   provided you've gotten your sunlight already,
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.080]   anytime you wake up in the middle of the night
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:30.920]   or any time of day."
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.840]   In other words, they're always good for you
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.480]   because it's a training mechanism
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.720]   by which you self-train your nervous system
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.260]   to go from a state of heightened alertness
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.040]   that you don't want to heightened relaxation
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.400]   that you do want.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.280]   And so it's really teaching you to hit the break.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.960]   And that brings us to an even more important point perhaps,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.520]   which is we've all experienced
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.360]   that we can stay up if we want to, right?
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.880]   If we wanna stay up late on New Year's
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.240]   or we wanna push an all-nighter,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.780]   some people can do that more easily than others,
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.340]   but we're all capable of doing that.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.840]   But it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.680]   And so there's a sort of asymmetry
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.600]   to the way our autonomic nervous system,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.820]   which governs this alertness, calmness thing,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.320]   the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system,
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.560]   there's an asymmetry there
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.440]   where we are more easily able to engage wakefulness
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.480]   and drive wakefulness.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.660]   We can force ourselves to stay awake.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:26.360]   Then we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.320]   And one of the things that I say over and over again,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.480]   and I'm gonna continue to say over and over again,
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.440]   is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.260]   When you have trouble falling asleep,
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.240]   you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.040]   And all the things I described, meditation, hypnosis,
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.720]   yoga nidra, all involve, exhale emphasized breathing,
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.780]   certain ways of lying down and controlling the body.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.080]   We're gonna get into breathing
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080]   in real depth at another time.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.580]   But all of those involve using the body to control the mind
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:00.060]   rather than trying to wrestle your mind
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.600]   into a certain pattern of relaxation.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.600]   So earlier in episode one, I talked about the Mobius strip,
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.200]   this continuous loop that is the brain-body relationship
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.020]   or the mind-body relationship.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.120]   And when we're having trouble controlling the mind,
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.620]   I encourage people to look towards the body,
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.720]   look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.580]   if that happens to be late at night.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.760]   So there's a theme that's starting to emerge,
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.120]   which is in order to control this thing
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.520]   that we call the nervous system,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.720]   we have to look back to some of the things
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.960]   we discussed earlier like sensation, perception, et cetera.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.120]   But we have to ask, what can we control?
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.760]   Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure,
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.000]   controlling your breathing and body.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.460]   I'm not going into details right now,
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.140]   but you can see the yoga nidra script
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.880]   or the reveriehealth.com or Headspace would be a great place
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.400]   to adopt the meditation practice.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.040]   Any of those are really teaching you to use your body
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.000]   to control your mind and to allow you to explore
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.760]   the mind-body relationship in a way
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   that gives you more control over your mind
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.320]   and the mind-body relationship, okay?
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.600]   So we talked about light,
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.200]   we talked about activity and timing of light,
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.040]   talked about the usefulness of naps
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.360]   and these things that I'm calling non-sleep deep rest,
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.840]   which include meditation, yoga nidra and hypnosis.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.280]   Non-sleep deep rest or what I hear after
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.000]   we will refer to as NSDR, not to be confused with EMDR.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.640]   I don't think I've ever heard NSDR.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   So I'm planting a flag for NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.280]   as a way to reset one's ability to be awake
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.100]   after you emerge from NSDR.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.560]   So to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend,
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.520]   some emotional stability reset,
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.640]   as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.440]   when you wanna go to sleep at night.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.160]   Now, non-sleep deep rest does have some research
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.140]   to support it.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.180]   There's a beautiful study done out of a university
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.640]   in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.380]   that showed that this meditation
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:06.880]   and yoga nidra type meditation allows dopamine
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.840]   and other neuromodulators in an area of the brain
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.080]   called the striatum that's involved in motor planning
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.360]   and motor execution to reset itself.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.840]   In other words, this NSDR can reset our ability
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.280]   to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.940]   in not to throw in another acronym,
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.200]   but NSDR resets your ability to engage in DPOs,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.800]   duration, path and outcome.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.240]   So now you're probably rolling your eyes,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.880]   like, oh my goodness, the number of acronyms.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   But just bear with me because NSDR is so powerful
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.240]   because first of all, it doesn't require
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.360]   that you rig yourself to any device.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.400]   It doesn't require that you take much time out of your day.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.800]   It doesn't require that you ingest anything except air.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.240]   And it can have so many positive effects
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.400]   right down to the neuromodulator level.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.240]   So I think in years to come, my lab's exploring this
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.420]   in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.060]   but other labs are looking at this as well.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.040]   I think NSDR is going to start to play a more prominent role
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.120]   in what we call wellness and health,
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.520]   both mental health and physical health.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.920]   So I encourage you to explore those practices.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.280]   Okay, so what about things that we can and maybe should
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.880]   or should not take in order to control
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.860]   and access better sleep and better wakefulness?
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.840]   We've talked about things you can do or not do.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.240]   We've talked about nutrition and the timing of nutrition.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.680]   Now let's talk about compounds.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.080]   Those could be prescription drugs.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.820]   Those could be supplements.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.880]   There are a number of different things
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.060]   that will affect your circadian timing and behavior.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.440]   In fact, almost everything that you could take
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.020]   will affect your circadian timing and behavior.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:44.860]   That's right.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.480]   So years ago, when I was in graduate school,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.440]   I had a professor, unfortunately he passed away now,
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.100]   but his name was Ted Jones, the late Edward Jones,
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.920]   who was a world-class neuroanatomist.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.820]   He wrote the book on the thalamus.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.440]   In fact, it's called "The Thalamus"
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.980]   and an expert on patterns of activation
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.480]   in the brain during sleep.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.980]   And I'll never forget that during one of these lectures,
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.300]   someone asked Ted the question,
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.100]   what is the effect of some drug on these waves of activity
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.340]   in the thalamus or something?
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.400]   And his answer was incredible.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400]   He was a pretty gruff guy.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.700]   And so his answer was delivered in the form
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.480]   of a kind of aggressive direct statement.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.340]   He said, "A drug is a substance that when injected
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.920]   into a person produces a scientific publication."
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.800]   And what he was saying is actually quite true,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200]   which is that most every compound will have some effect
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.180]   on some aspect of biology.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.880]   This is why it's hard to sort through everything
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.720]   that's on PubMed.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.520]   If you put any molecule or compound or drug into PubMed
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.120]   and then you put sleep next to it or alertness next to it,
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.900]   you're likely to find a paper where there's an effect.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.380]   But that's not necessarily telling you
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.820]   that that drug is useful or helpful for that.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.440]   What it's telling you is that anytime you change
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.700]   what you take or you stop taking something,
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.200]   say you're taking sleeping pills, Ambien or whatever it is,
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.760]   and you stop taking them, your sleep behavior will change.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.000]   Let's say you take an aspirin,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.120]   you don't normally take aspirin,
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.280]   you will shift your circadian rhythm.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.200]   Now you might not shift it perceptibly,
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.100]   you might not create problems for yourself,
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.820]   but anytime you ingest a compound at high potency,
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.120]   you're going to provide some shift to your circadian rhythm.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.960]   Now that said, there are a couple of things
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.600]   that are directly in line with the biology related
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.880]   to falling and staying asleep
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.920]   and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.440]   There's a whole category of things like stimulants,
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:39.920]   cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.040]   that are, the prescription ones were designed
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.440]   for the treatment of narcolepsy,
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.740]   so things like modafinil or armadafinil
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.140]   that are designed to create wakefulness.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:52.680]   They are all essentially chemical variants
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.600]   of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.080]   Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.600]   that things like cocaine and amphetamine
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.160]   are just across the board bad.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.040]   They have so many addictive and terrible effects.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.080]   In the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional,
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.280]   things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.560]   I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall,
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.080]   even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.360]   in order to increase wakefulness.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.000]   That is essentially, well, it's illegal for one,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.540]   but it's also, it's abusing the system in the sense
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.720]   that you're pushing back on the adenosine system
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.100]   slightly differently than you do caffeine.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.340]   It will make you feel more alert.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.560]   There tends to be a heavy rebound,
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.340]   and they do have an addictive potential.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.900]   There are also some other effects of those
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.740]   that can be quite bad.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.020]   So we're going to explore stimulants
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.840]   in a whole month related to drugs,
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.900]   but there are some supplements and some things
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.280]   that are safer, certainly safer,
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.160]   and that in cases where you're doing
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.200]   all the right behaviors,
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.720]   you're exercising and eating correctly,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.420]   and you're still having trouble with sleep,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.040]   that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.540]   Now, I want to be very clear, I am not pushing supplements.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.760]   I'm just pointing you towards some things
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.340]   that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.380]   to have some benefit.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.820]   The first one is magnesium.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.340]   There are many forms of magnesium,
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.740]   but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.860]   on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep,
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:23.620]   mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA,
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.760]   which help turn off the DPO,
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.260]   the kind of thinking about the future,
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.880]   duration path outcome analysis,
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   and make one's mind kind of drift in space and time
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.700]   and make it easier to fall asleep.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.480]   There are a lot of forms of magnesium out there,
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.180]   but one in particular is magnesium threonate,
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.980]   T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.300]   which you have to check to see if this is right for you,
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.420]   check with your doctor,
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.420]   but magnesium threonate is associated with transporters
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.480]   in the body that bring more of it into cells
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.320]   that allow people to feel this kind of drowsiness
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.380]   and help them fall asleep.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.100]   So I personally, I can only talk about what I personally do.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.380]   I personally take three or 400 milligrams of magnesium
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.380]   threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.820]   and it helps me fall asleep.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.580]   The other thing is theanine,
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:20.140]   100 to 200 milligrams of theanine for me
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.980]   also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.940]   I take it 30 to 60 minutes throughout the day.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.320]   Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.320]   to a lot of energy drinks
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.520]   in order to take away the jitters
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.920]   that are associated with drinking too much caffeine
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.100]   or with some other things that are in the energy drinks.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.120]   Energy drinks can be problematic.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.780]   They can contain a lot of L-torine.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.780]   I'll just tell you an anecdote.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.620]   When I was a postdoc,
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.780]   I was drinking a lot of a particular energy drink,
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.820]   has a lot of taurine in it,
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.080]   and actually the whites of my eyes,
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.440]   the sclera as it's called in my eyes turned beet red,
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.680]   and I went to a friend who's an ophthalmologist.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.780]   I said, "Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.880]   I haven't been hit on the head.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.000]   I don't know what's going on."
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   And he looked and he said,
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.380]   "I think you've got some microvascular damage."
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:08.400]   And we walked through what I was taking and doing,
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.420]   and he said, "Oh, it's probably the taurine,
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:11.560]   excessive levels of taurine
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.880]   can create some microvascular damage.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.920]   So if you're having the microvascular damage in your eye,
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.400]   you'll probably have microvascular damage
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.900]   deeper in your skull."
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.740]   So I stopped.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.720]   That's the reason why I don't take energy drinks.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.960]   So just a consideration.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.900]   Again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do,
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.120]   but just want to arm you with information.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.800]   The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.400]   They do, for some people,
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.200]   they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.960]   that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.140]   So you have to play with these things and titrate them
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.240]   if you decide to use them.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.780]   Again, if you decide to go this route.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.080]   I would not start by taking supplements.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.420]   I would start by getting your light viewing behavior correct
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.000]   and then think about your nutrition
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.280]   and then think about your activity
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.760]   and then think about whether or not you want a supplement.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.860]   We already talked about melatonin earlier.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.820]   There's another supplement that could be quite useful,
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.700]   which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.680]   which is a derivative chamomile.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.000]   50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment or support
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.160]   this kind of creation of a sleepiness
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.400]   to help fall asleep and stay asleep.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.120]   A note about sleepwalkers and people with very vivid dreams.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.720]   Theanine can often make your dreams very vivid.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.400]   Sleepwalkers should be careful about taking theanine.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.800]   Everyone should be careful about taking anything
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.560]   and don't take anything without consulting
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.860]   your board-certified MD or healthcare professional first.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.720]   Your health is your responsibility.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.120]   I am not going to take responsibility
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.740]   for what you decide to do experimentally in any case,
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.640]   but especially as it relates to supplementation and drugs.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.880]   As a important point,
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.560]   apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.280]   So women who want to keep their estrogen levels high
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.200]   or at whatever levels they happen to be at
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.720]   should probably avoid apigenin altogether.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.320]   And men take that into consideration as well.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.580]   Men need estrogen also.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.960]   You don't want to completely eliminate your estrogen.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.640]   That can create all sorts of bad effects
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.220]   on libido and cognition, et cetera.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.240]   So apigenin in some people
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.080]   is going to be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.640]   So keep that in mind.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.840]   There are other things you can take
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.460]   to help you sleep better.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.220]   Those are the legal ones that at least I'm aware of
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.760]   have pretty broad safety margins.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.300]   But again, you need to explore your safety margins
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.340]   with any compound.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:29.120]   I think a great website that I can refer you to
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.780]   is examine.com.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.620]   Examine the word, just as it sounds, .com is a website.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.060]   I have no relation to them.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:38.660]   But there you can find links to peer-reviewed studies
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.160]   for any compound or supplement,
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.800]   as well as some important warnings
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.360]   related to the things I discussed,
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.620]   as well as any other thing that you might decide
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.520]   to supplement with or ingest to help improve your sleep.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.120]   Okay, that was a lot of information
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.800]   about how to get better at sleeping,
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.740]   falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.760]   An important feature of this podcast, as you know,
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.320]   is that we dive deep into topics
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.440]   for several episodes at a time,
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.320]   at least a month at a time.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.160]   So by stopping here,
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.520]   I recognize that there are probably many more questions
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.800]   that you still have.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.480]   And the great thing about that
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.040]   is that we have another episode coming up soon.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.980]   I'm going to hold office hours
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.320]   where I'm going to answer your specific questions
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.500]   about episodes one and two.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.800]   So if you have questions about this episode,
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.280]   you have questions about episode one,
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.940]   write them down, put them in the comments.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.440]   I'll also do a post on Instagram
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.560]   where you can put them in the comments there,
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.340]   but put them in the comments to this episode.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:41.940]   As well, please recommend the podcast if you like it.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:44.320]   Please subscribe to it here on YouTube.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.420]   Please subscribe to it on Apple.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:48.320]   We're now on Spotify as well.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.860]   Recommend it to a friend.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.040]   The community that we're creating here
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.100]   around these topics of sleep and wakefulness
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.500]   and other neuroscience and health-related themes
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.020]   is best supported by your involvement and your questions.
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.140]   And so I'm going to be reading all of your questions,
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.580]   distilling those into the most commonly asked questions
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.780]   and liked questions.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.840]   So if you see something below
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.740]   that you are particularly interested in,
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.140]   you don't have to put that question in again,
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.780]   you can just give it a like, the little thumbs up tab.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:17.780]   And if you're listening to this on Spotify or Apple,
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.300]   please go to YouTube,
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.940]   subscribe and put your question there,
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.040]   or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.620]   and you can put your questions there
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.060]   so that next episode I can answer those questions
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.460]   and then we can move forward even more deeply
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:32.640]   into these critical topics around sleep and wakefulness
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.820]   so that you can be armed with all the information
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.060]   and resources that you need.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.180]   Last but not least,
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.020]   a number of you have very graciously asked
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.080]   how you can support the podcast.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.520]   The best way to support the podcast
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.800]   is to subscribe on YouTube or one of the other platforms,
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.820]   we're now on Spotify and Apple.
