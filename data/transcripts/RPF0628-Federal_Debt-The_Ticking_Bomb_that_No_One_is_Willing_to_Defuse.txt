[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:10.760]   the amount of money that we borrow each year to fund our collective promises and the increasing ever increasing federal debt.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:24.840]   Now this is of course a common theme on Radical Personal Finance. I've discussed this many times over the last five years of the show and today is no different. I have nothing as much has changed.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   However, I find it fascinating to look at what is not happening right now, which is why I'm reprising the title of this video.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:52.980]  , because I want to prove a point to you, namely, that no one is willing to even talk about spending less money. And if that is true, then why should we expect the future to be anything different? I'm especially interested in this with discussions of the recent Green New Deal legislation or proposed legislation, which has all the political power right now in the world of politics.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.980]   It's quite the interesting conversation. I think it's interesting to look at this and see what happens.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.980]   But I think it's interesting to look at this and see what happens.

[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   The first I want to first deal with a couple of big questions and there are two basic big questions that that are really.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   Rebuttals or people saying, oh, they're objections. And I want to deal with two objections. Number one, objection number one is federal borrowing is governmental borrowing a problem.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   Frequently when I do these shows, I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing a problem.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.020]   Frequently when I do these shows, I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing a problem.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:22.900]   Frequently when I do these shows, I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing a problem.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.960]   Frequently when I do these shows, I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing a problem.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.000]   Frequently when I do these shows, I've been asked a lot of questions about the government borrowing a problem.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   After a recent discussion of this listener of mine sent me a I thought particularly cogent question. I share it with you as an interesting rebuttal to that objection. The question is this since it is believed that debt has no negative consequences and we can print our way out of any problem. What's the logical objection to a good debt?
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:33.280]   stomach

[00:41:50.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   The reason asks this. By the mid-2030s, there are going to be benefit cuts in Social Security. That's not 2023, but maybe there's some sort of a political trigger there that can push reform? Riedel. In 2034, the Social Security Trust Fund goes bankrupt and will require an automatic 20% benefit cut. That's written in the law. The danger is, if we wait until 2034 to fix Social Security, we're dead. By that point, we will have already had a substantial debt crisis.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   The danger is, if we wait until 2034 to fix Social Security, we're dead. By that point, we will have already had a substantial debt crisis. By that point, we will have already had a substantial debt crisis.

[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:50.480]   I'm not sure if you know what the reason is. How do you expect that debt crisis to unfold? Riedel. The danger is that if the debt keeps growing, at a certain point investors will stop lending us money at reasonable interest rates. They will be reasonably concerned that the debt is growing beyond our ability to finance it. They will demand higher interest rates, and every one percentage point increase in interest rates will add $13 trillion in interest costs over 30 years.

[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   And every one percentage point increase in interest rates will add $13 trillion dollars in interest costs over 30 years.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:43:20.500]   Deswegen, in order to avoid a debt crisis, we will have to borrow even more money. As interest rates go up, we will have to borrow even more to make the interest payments, which causes the debt to go even higher. At a certain point, the investors will demand that we get our fiscal house in order. It will likely start with low-hanging fruit. Tax hikes for the rich, for example, but those won't be enough. Eventually, you'll be left with two choices. Either significantly raise taxes on the middle class, or significantly cut benefits to current seniors.

[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   And that's a maddening problem.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   If I thought that tomorrow, my neighbors were going to start shooting me for
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   and that's a maddening problem.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   that's a maddening problem.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:50:20.780]   I mean, I'm not sure how that's going to work.

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   But in terms of the future, I mean, I'm not sure how much more people are going to do things that are going to do.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:27.340]   But if I thought that, then maybe I would be willing to move to the boonies and live in a cabin with my family.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.600]   But at this point in time, it's hard.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:41.960]   It's very hard for me and the life that I want to live to conceive that it's right for me to move to the mountains and live in a cabin or to build a nuclear bunker under the world.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:49.260]   I respect those who do, but it's hard for me to fit that into my optimism for life and to figure out how does this actually integrate.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.800]   And so the problem is,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   and I'm not sure how that's going to work.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   But in terms of the future, I mean, I'm not sure how that's going to work.
