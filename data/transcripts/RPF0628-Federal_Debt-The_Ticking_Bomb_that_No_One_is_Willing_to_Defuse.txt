[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.500]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   My name is Joshua, and today we talk about the ticking bomb that no one is willing to
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.500]   defuse. Perhaps I should retitle that. The ticking bomb that no one is willing to talk
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.500]   about the possibility or desirability of defusing, namely the US federal debt, the growing federal
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.000]   debt, the current deficit, the amount of money we borrow each year to fund our collective
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   promises, and the increasing federal debt.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   This is of course a common theme on Radical Personal Finance. I've discussed this many
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   times over the last five years of the show, and today is no different. Nothing much has
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   changed. However, I find it fascinating to look at what is not happening right now, which
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   is why I'm reprising this topic, because I want to prove a point to you, namely that
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   no one is willing to even talk about spending less money. And if that is true, then why
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   should we expect the future to be anything different?
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   I'm especially interested in this with discussions of the recent Green New Deal legislation,
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.000]   or proposed legislation, which has all the political power right now in the world of
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   politics. It's quite the interesting conversation.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I want to first deal with a couple of big questions. And there are two basic big questions
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.500]   that are really rebuttals or people saying, "Oh, they're objections." And I want to deal
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.000]   with two objections. Number one, objection number one, is federal borrowing, is governmental
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   borrowing a problem? Frequently when I do these shows, I've received communication
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   from listeners saying, "Joshua, listen, you are wrong about the fact that federal
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500]   borrowing is a problem. It's not a problem. In fact, there's a healthy level of debt
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   that is good for a government to be engaged in. And don't you know, after all, you can't
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   compare, what might be tempting to compare the federal government with an individual
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   household. You can't do that because the individual household doesn't have taxing
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   ability. They don't have military ability to force that taxation upon their citizens,
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   etc. So you just have to leave it how it is. It's not a problem."
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000]   After a recent discussion of this, a listener of mine sent me a, I thought, particularly
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   cogent question. And I share it with you as an interesting rebuttal to that objection.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The question is this, "Since it is believed that debt has no negative consequences and
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.500]   we can print our way out of any problem, what's the logical objection to a 0% income tax?"
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.000]   I repeat, "Since it is believed that debt has no negative consequences and we can print
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   our way out of any problem, what's the logical objection to a 0% income tax?"
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Here's why I thought that particular question was so remarkable in terms of its phrasing.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.500]   There are only three sources of funds that a government has. There are only three sources
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.000]   of funds. And those three sources are, number one, taxation, create revenue for the government
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.500]   through taxation. Number two, borrowing, issuing of bonds or other debt instruments in order
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   to borrow money from people who want to lend money to the government in exchange for interest.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.000]   And number three, inflation, inflation of the money supply so that today's obligations
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.500]   can be paid back with larger, sorry, less, more dollars in the future that are worth
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   less. Those are the only three sources of government funds, taxation, borrowing, and
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   inflation. Those are the only three levers that a politician has to push on. Do they
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   want to tax? Do they want to borrow? Or do they want to inflate? I can't think of a single
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   additional source of government funds. I guess in theory we could make the argument fee for
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.000]   services, but whoever tries that. Taxation, borrowing, and inflation. So here's the question.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   "Since it is believed that debt has no negative consequences and we can print our way out
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   of any problem, what's the logical objection to a 0% income tax?" Now, lest you think that
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   we are fighting against a straw man here with a discussion of the idea that debt has no
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   negative consequences or that we can print our way out of any problem, let me refer you
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to your newspaper where I watch day after day after day mainstream publicly acclaimed
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   persons, including some with the title of economists and popular columns in large newspapers,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   say day after day, "Debt has no negative consequences and the government always has
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   the ability to print their money, print their way out of any problem." So why is it that
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   taxation is always attacked? Now consider that. Hopefully you find it interesting to
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.500]   consider in regard to your own situation. I'll give you some more specific examples
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   in a moment. Objection number two is a little bit thornier. The second objection is this.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:14.000]   "How do you know that this is the time that we'll be in crisis?" And here's where I think
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I'm very humble because I can trace back at least through the 1970s, the 1980s, the
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s, I can find article after article, prediction after prediction,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.500]   prognostication after prognostication saying, "This is the end. The government now owes
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   $1 trillion." Well, here we are $21 trillion later. Or, "Now we're running a trillion dollar
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   deficit." Well, here we are with years of trillion dollar deficits coming up. So I think
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.000]   we should be very humble about our timing because just to say that there is a problem
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   doesn't mean that we can know when the problem will manifest itself. In my mind, an engineering
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   metaphor is appropriate. An engineer can go and inspect something like a bridge, a highway
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.500]   bridge, and the things that lead to bridges falling down are not unknown. They're not
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   voodoo. It's not as though bridges all of a sudden fall for no reason. The vast majority
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.000]   of those things can be found with a proper and complete inspection. An engineer can find
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.500]   a crack in a bridge. An engineer can recognize that this particular equipment, this particular
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:45.000]   substance, this steel, this concrete is being stressed beyond its design parameters. Those
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.500]   things can be found. Recently, there was a devastating dam break in Brazil. What's usually
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   so amazing about those massive catastrophes is the engineers knew it was going to happen.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   They knew it was going to happen. A couple of years ago, I watched another documentary
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:15.000]   on the space shuttle, I think it was Challenger, the one that blew up on liftoff. The engineers
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   knew it was going to happen. It wasn't a shock to them. In fact, with the Challenger
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   explosion, it was a massive issue of management where everyone said, "No, we've got to
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.500]   get this thing. We've got to take this thing off." In that particular situation, forgive
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   me if I botch some of the details of this, but the liftoff weather was too cold. The
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.000]   O-rings that were supposed to be sealing the rocket fuel were not tested and were not certified
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   to be functional as they should be at that level of cold weather on the morning of liftoff.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   There were warnings being sent to the NASA management team, "No, this is not certified."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   The engineers had said, "No, we shouldn't do this." But the NASA management team
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.500]   had to press forward and they bowled over the people who tried to stand in the way.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.000]   They launched the shuttle and we all know the history, Challenger, everyone died. Of
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.500]   course, it was a massive loss. The same thing could be applied to bridges and space shuttles.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   If an engineer inspects a bridge and they can find a crack, they know that in time that
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   bridge will fail. The problem is, what does it mean in time? And there are various things
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.500]   that could change. So the bridge, if you were trying to make an estimate, you could start
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.000]   with the severity of the crack, but then you also have to take into account other stresses.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.500]   Is salt water weakening something in it or is it fresh water? What's the level of traffic
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.000]   going across the bridge, etc., etc., etc. I'm not an engineer. You engineers can come
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   up with many other things that affect it. And so when you're trying to make predictions
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   on things that have many, many factors involved, you can't necessarily always get it right.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.500]   About the best that you could hope for is to be directionally right, to know this is
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.000]   a problem and to watch it and to see what happens.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now one of the books that I read last year that really helped me more than almost anything
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   else to gain some historical perspective was a book called The Silk Road. And the author
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.500]   went through thousands of years of history of The Silk Road and talked about all the
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   things that happened. One of the things I was so struck by was the level of economic
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   analysis that was in that book. It's not an economics book. It's a history book.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   But there was a huge amount of discussion of what happened to bring down all of these
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.000]   different empires throughout history. And in my personal copy, all over the place, I've
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.500]   got dollar signs, I've got interest rates, I've got borrowing, I've got collapse.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   I see the threads throughout history in a way that's often hard to find. But the challenge
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   is that's dealing with hundreds, literally in that book, thousands of years of history.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   And yet none of us have that perspective on our lifetime. We are constrained by the shortness
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:14.000]   of our own lives. I personally have never lived in difficult economic times. I have
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   never lived in difficult economic times. The few times when the global economy has been
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   in recession, I've personally always been even insulated from those things. Yes, I've
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   lived through 2008. I was insulated from it. I wasn't in a financially vulnerable situation.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I wasn't in a town that had a bad economy. I wasn't in a rural area. I wasn't in Detroit.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Whatever. I was insulated from all of that. And so basically, my entire life, the economy
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   has been fine. It's been good. So it's especially hard for me to believe those warnings.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.500]   So I want to just move on now from these two questions. And I simply want to say, in response
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.500]   to number one, is government debt a problem? The answer has to be yes, or at least yes
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.000]   it can be. And we would look to certain factors to understand if it's a problem.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.500]   A crack that's small and off to the side of the bridge doesn't necessarily mean that the
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   whole bridge is going to collapse. A crack that's a hairline crack that's running right
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.500]   underneath the middle of the bridge is probably something we should pay attention to. I'm
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.000]   convinced, personally, that there's a hairline crack at the very least running right through
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   the middle of the bridge. And I'm going to use some data in today's show to show that
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.500]   to you. Number two, with regard to timing, I want to be always very humble, very humble
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:32.000]   with any kind of timing. I will say this. I do not expect there to be any kind of imminent
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   financial crisis that's caused by government borrowing within the coming years, perhaps
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   decade. I don't expect that. I don't expect that. I want to be prepared in case it happens,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.500]   but I don't expect that. Now, on the flip side, if I live a normal, long-lived lifespan,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.000]   as I expect and hope to live, I will be shocked if it doesn't happen during my lifetime. But
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   there's a whole lot of room in there. Now, we'll get to how to solve it. In fact, I've
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.500]   just finished a course on how to solve it with a minimal amount of cost because of this
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:14.000]   uncertainty. But today, I just want to talk about some of the problems. As I continue,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.500]   thus far, I have tried to answer two common questions or objections. Now, the bulk of
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.000]   this show is going to be divided into two basic theses. Number one, thesis number one,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.500]   no one in today's world is even willing to discuss the current problem. And that doesn't
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   give me confidence for the future. If today we're not even willing to discuss it publicly,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   I don't have any confidence that things are going to change in the future. And then number
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.500]   two, I think the problems are only getting worse. We'll get to that. Let's start about
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   discussion. For today, I'm going to read you a few excerpts from an interesting article
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:58.000]   that was published October 17, 2018. This particular article and its accompanying proposal
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   or essay was from September 2018, almost six months ago. The title of the article is from
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Reason Magazine, Reason.com. "We've never had deficits like this during peace and prosperity
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   before." Subheadline, "Brian Riedel has a plan to stabilize the national debt at 95%
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   of GDP. He says trying it might be political suicide, but the alternative is much worse."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.500]   Now, I repeat, this is from six months ago as I record this show. I want to read to you
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.000]   a few important paragraphs. "On Monday, the Treasury Department reported that fiscal year
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.500]   2018's budget deficit was the largest since 2012, and it is increasingly likely that America
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.000]   will see the return of a $1 trillion deficit before the end of 2019. We've been here before,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.500]   but this time it is different. When America ran a $1 trillion deficit in the years just
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.000]   after the 2008 economic collapse, the recovering economy quickly put a dent in the deficit.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And even though it's been more than 20 years since the last time the federal government
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.500]   ran a surplus, a sense of an impending disaster passed as annual deficits reached merely into
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.000]   the hundreds of billions of dollars. Now, after a decade of economic growth, the United
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.500]   States stands again at the edge of a $1 trillion deficit, not the result of a sudden economic
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.000]   downturn, but caused by the inexorable growth of entitlement programs, and exacerbated by
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   the current Congress' decision to hike spending while also cutting taxes. Unlike a decade
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   ago, this looming debt crisis won't be solved by a few years of economic growth. Even under
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.500]   the rosiest of scenarios, the federal deficit is on course to hit $2 trillion by the middle
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:51.000]   of the next decade. The national debt totals more than $20 trillion and continues to grow.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   On its current trajectory, it will surpass the size of the nation's economy, a level
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   that has been seen only at the height of World War II before 2030. Social Security will go
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   bankrupt a few years after that, and mandatory benefit cuts will be enacted. As America passes
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   those various harbingers of fiscal doom, it's likely that the rest of the world will take
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.500]   notice and stop lending money to the United States or demand higher interest payments
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.000]   for future borrowing, compounding the problem. "Eventually you'll be left with two choices,"
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Brian Riedel, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, tells Reason. "Either significantly
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   raise taxes on the middle class or significantly cut benefits to current seniors. If we do
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   neither, you will have a major financial crisis."
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It goes on and we talk about a report that Brian Riedel published. I want to skip to
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:00.500]   a couple of important questions where he talks about basically his idea of talking about
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   how he approaches his report, which is to say that if five years from now, that there
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.500]   are certain things that can be done now so that five years from now we can start to have
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.500]   a conversation about changing spending, changing taxes, changing something so that there will
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   be some sanity restored to our fiscal situation.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   So the Reason reporter starts with the questions. "I want to start with the numbers in this
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   report because there are some big, really scary numbers here, but also numbers that
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.000]   I think are very difficult for people to conceptualize. Within the next year, we will be running a
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   trillion-dollar annual deficit. That's a huge number. How should we think about that?"
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Riedel. "We're about to be hit with a fiscal tsunami that we're not prepared for.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.500]   The national debt right now is $20 trillion, and we're going to be hit with an $84 trillion
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.000]   shortfall over the next 30 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And that's
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   the rosy scenario. One way to think about it is, in order to pay for all of this, your
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.500]   federal tax burden would have to double. As a percentage of the economy, federal spending
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:13.000]   is going to grow towards European levels." Reason writes this. "You write a lot in this
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.500]   study about 2023, five years from now, as being a significant threshold for addressing
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   these problems. Why is that?" Riedel. "The proposals that I recommend to avert this debt
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.000]   crisis start five years from now, and it's not because we can afford to wait five years.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   As a matter of fact, waiting five years will make things a lot worse than if we do it now.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   It's an acknowledgment of the politics at play. Politically, we are not close to being
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.500]   ready for the kind of reforms we are going to need. Not only is the country in denial,
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   the House is in denial, the Senate is in denial, the White House is in denial. I think we may
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.000]   need five years of trillion-dollar deficits just to lay the groundwork." Reason. "Baby
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.500]   Boomers retiring, as you said, is driving this huge expansion in the cost of two old-age
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare. How much of this entire deficit
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.000]   problem is the entitlement spending? Can't we cut in other areas to offset that?" Riedel.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "Over the next 30 years, Social Security and Medicare will run a $100 trillion deficit.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.500]   Social Security will run an $18 trillion deficit, Medicare $41 trillion, and the interest on
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   that debt will be $41 trillion more. The rest of the budget is going to run a $16 trillion
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:34.000]   surplus over the next 30 years. In other words, our long-term deficit is 100% the result of
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Social Security and Medicare." Revenues, even if the tax cuts are extended, are going
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   to continue rising above historical averages. Every other part of the budget is shrinking
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.500]   as a percentage of GDP. This is 100% Social Security and Medicare, and that is the result
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   of two factors, 74 million retiring baby boomers and growing health care costs. In Medicare,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:06.000]   the average couple retiring today will have paid $140,000 into the system over their lifetime
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.500]   and will get $420,000 back. When you throw 74 million baby boomers into a system that
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:19.000]   pays you back triple what you put in, it's going to blow up. The reason I fixate so much
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   on Social Security and Medicare is because the hole is too big to be closed in any other
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   part of the budget. Reason goes on. When it comes to tackling this problem, it's helpful
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.500]   to think about these costs as a percentage of GDP. Because $1 trillion is hard enough
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.000]   to understand, and $84 trillion over 30 years is a figure I can't really wrap my head around
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.500]   either. But in this paper, you're presenting a series of ideas for addressing the debt
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.000]   crisis, and they're all scored by how much revenue they would raise as a percentage of
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.500]   GDP. It's a little bit like a choose your own adventure here. But before we get into
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   those proposals, explain why it's helpful to think in terms of percentage of GDP. Our
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   debt to GDP ratio, for example, is almost higher than it's ever been.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.000]   Riedel. Historically, the debt has been around 40% of GDP since the end of World War II,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.500]   on average. In fact, when the Great Recession started in 2007, the debt was almost exactly
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:16.500]   40% of GDP. If we just keep the current policies, it's going to be approximately 200% of GDP
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:22.500]   in 30 years. The danger is, as the debt gets bigger, interest rates go up. That means you
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.000]   have to borrow more money to pay the interest, but that just makes the debt bigger. So you
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   have a vicious cycle of debt and interest rates. My plan is to stabilize the debt at
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.500]   95% of GDP permanently. Now, let me interrupt here and just explain. This proposal and the
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:46.000]   numbers I'm about to go through with these ideas, quote unquote, don't pay off the
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:58.500]   debt. All it does is freeze it at 95% of GDP, which is more than double of what it was in
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:07.000]   2007. So listen to how impossible these numbers are that I'm about to go to and recognize.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   This is not about paying off the debt. This is not about reducing the debt. This is about
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.500]   stabilizing the debt at 95% of GDP. Reason. Let's go through some of your ideas. On the
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.000]   left, we often hear the idea that we can raise taxes on the rich to fund entitlements. Riedel.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.500]   The tax the rich argument is pretty common. It's not even close to sufficient. If you
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.000]   just look at an extreme example, let's have the government sees all income earned over
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   $500,000 per year, you would raise 5% of GDP. Even if you seized every dollar over $500,000
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.500]   per year, you still wouldn't close the gap. Another example, the two top tax brackets
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:59.000]   right now are 35% and 37%. If you double them to 70 and 74%, you get maybe 1.5% of GDP out
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   of the 6% you need. And that's with a doubling of federal tax rates on the rich. It is mathematically
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.500]   impossible to close this gap by tax hikes for the rich. Reason. That gets you maybe
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.000]   a quarter of the way there. Riedel. Yeah, you're a quarter of the way there, but that's
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   before you take into account any economic feedback effects for tax evasion or tax avoidance.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.500]   Reason. Our friends on the left also like to talk about a value-added tax, which is
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.500]   basically a more robust sales tax. This is something that's quite common in Europe,
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.000]   and on some level, this makes sense to me. If we're going to have a welfare state that's
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   as expensive as the ones across Europe, we'd probably have to tax like Europe to pay for
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.500]   it. Riedel. Realistically, if you're going to close this gap with tax, you're going to
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:51.000]   have to do what Europe does and tax the middle class. The United States would need a 34%
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   national sales tax just to pay for the current spending that has been promised in the pipeline
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.500]   and stabilize the debt at 95%. Alternatively, we could raise the payroll tax. That would
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   have to be raised to 33% to pay for all the spending. And importantly, you're not adding
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:16.000]   any new benefits. You're not adding any of Bernie Sanders' wish list here. This is just
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   to pay for the benefits of senior citizens. Do middle class families want to pay a 34%
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.500]   value-added tax for benefits they may never see? For benefits that flow exclusively to
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.000]   senior citizens? And let's remember that senior citizens today are the wealthiest age group
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   in the wealthiest country in world history. We're going to raise $80 trillion over 30
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   years and give it to the wealthiest group in the country rather than using it on any
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   of our other national interests? Reason. So we can't tax the rich to solve this. Let's
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   talk about some of the other options. On the right, we usually hear about closing tax loopholes
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   or doing away with tax credit programs, the earned income tax credit, the mortgage deduction.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Those ideas bring in more revenue, but how does that measure up against what we need?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Riedel, there is a policy case for closing tax loopholes, but in terms of the 6% of GDP
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   that has to be raised, they are not even a rounding error. Those add up to approximately
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   0.1% of GDP. It's okay to advocate those policies, but let's not kid ourselves. It
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   is pennies compared to what is needed. Reason. What about economic growth? The tax cuts were
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   going to pay for themselves, we were told, because of the economic growth they would
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   unleash. That didn't happen, of course, but the economy is doing well right now. Can
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   we roll the dice and hope this just continues forever? Riedel. If we had a historic surge
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   of economic growth, in theory, that could close 40% of the long-term gap, until you
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   realize that social security benefits are tied to the economy. The faster the economy
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   grows, the more incomes rise, and therefore the higher social security benefits you automatically
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   qualify for. Even if the growth comes, a lot of the money goes right back out in automatically
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   higher benefits. Reason. That might be worse than the feedback loop with the debt. Even
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   if the times are good, we can't get out of this hole. Riedel. If there were an easy
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   solution, we would have solved this decades ago. Reason. We've danced around this for
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   a while, but you really can't get away from it. The politics of what you are proposing,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   of what you are saying is necessary, just seem completely impossible to surmount. You're
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   pretty up front about the fact that this is going to take a combination of difficult choices
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   from both parties, but where is the appetite for that going to come from? Riedel. There
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   is no appetite for that in Washington. None. Republicans are cutting taxes, and Democrats
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   are proposing $42 trillion in new spending over 10 years. No one is taking this even
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   remotely seriously. The challenge right now is that when you talk to people about how
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   to solve the long-term debt crisis, everyone has their pet theory that is simplistic, easy
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   to understand, and completely wrong. As long as everyone has their pet theory on how to
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   fix this, no one is going to be willing to endure the real pain it is going to take.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Reason. Best case scenario probably is that a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   get together after the midterms, look at that looming $1 trillion deficit, read your report,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   and decide to pursue some of the options you've outlined here. Even if that were to happen,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   whoever proposes these huge tax increases or new taxes, I imagine, would be immediately
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   run out of office. Even if there were a centrist coalition in Washington that could make this
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   happen, would voters allow it? Listen carefully to Riedel's response.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   "My plan, as written, is political suicide. And this is probably the most politically
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   plausible plan that could probably solve the long-term problem, and even this would be
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   political suicide. It raises taxes across the board, it restrains Social Security and
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Medicare, it allows defense to continue falling as a percentage of GDP. The argument that
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I am making is that the status quo or any alternative solution is even worse."
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   That, my friends, is not a bright picture. Remember again that Riedel's plan here is
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   to stabilize federal borrowing and the federal deficit at 95% of GDP. And as he writes there,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   it is political suicide. Now that particular interview was from six months ago. And I ask
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   you this question, what has happened since the publication of that interview in October
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   of 2018 to March of 2019? Have we suddenly had a massive cadre of fiscally conservative
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Republicans and Democrats start to come together and say, "Let's tackle this problem
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   seriously. Let's start to talk about some solutions that we could engage in and think
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   about how we could solve our problem." Has that happened in the last six months?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Can you point me to a single person who is vigorously, repeatedly advocating for fiscal
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   restraint, who's dealing with reality? I can't point to anybody. Rather what we see
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   is a massive press with a lot of energy going in exactly the other way. Which brings me
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   to the Green New Deal. Now I was fascinated, I have been fascinated over the last weeks
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   to watch the conversation as it relates to the so-called Green New Deal. And I was
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   fortunate enough to bumble into this story in real time. I try to minimally pay attention
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   to politics. I have a disease, an addiction that I can't quite overcome. So unfortunately
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I pay more attention than I probably should. But I try to at least keep it modest and moderate
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   in terms of the amount of time that I spend on it. But a couple of weeks ago I happened
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   to bumble into the Green New Deal on the very day that it was starting to be published.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Where the various representatives started to publish all of their documents, etc. It's
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   fascinating for me to watch it develop in real time. Now the most important thing to
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   me has been to watch the way that public perception of documents is handled based upon putting
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   things out and not putting things out. My personal summary of what happened was the
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   proponents of the Green New Deal, sponsor in the House, in the US House, sponsor in
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   the Senate, started to put all the documents out. And then they started to receive massive
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   pushback on the silliness of their proposals. And then they started to take things back.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And then they tried to say, "Well listen, a bunch of stuff got out early that wasn't
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   supposed to get out." That's still the case of what is said. Now I took the original documents
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   as basically the opening gambit in negotiation. You go to a local bazaar and they say you're
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   going to buy something and you ask how much it is. It's $100. And you counter by saying
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I'll give you $5. And you both know you're making stupid offers and you're going to meet
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   somewhere around the middle but that's how the game is played. So that's how I took it.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But what's happened is I've watched the proponents of the Green New Deal dramatically even pull
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   back and not even be willing to say that rather to say, "Oh, well some stuff leaked out there."
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I don't buy that for an instant because I was watching it in real time. I carefully
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   sourced my data. I was having various documents and things on mainstream websites. And now
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   the idea is that the Frequently Asked Questions document, the Green New Deal fact, which is
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   not the same as legislation that was submitted, was released accidentally, which is nonsense
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   because somehow it was sent publicly to all of the mainstream news websites and published
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   on a US House of Representatives official website as a valuable document.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   But what I found in this particular document to be so fascinating, and if you're not familiar
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   with it, it calls for dramatic change. The idea that we have to make a massive investment
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   in our society by basically a laundry list of almost every single thing that the left
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   wing kind of dream list of everything that would be happening. So here's from the reading
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   directly from the Frequently Asked Questions that was published. It says this, "This is
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   a massive transformation of our society with clear goals and a timeline. The Green New
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Deal resolution, a 10-year plan to mobilize every aspect of American society at a scale
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   not seen since World War II to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   prosperity for all." It will move America to 100% clean and renewable energy, create
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   millions of family-supporting wage union jobs, ensure a just transition for all communities
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and workers to ensure economic security for peoples and communities that have historically
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   relied on fossil fuel industries, ensure justice and equity for frontline communities by prioritizing
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   investment, training, climate, and community resiliency, economic and environmental benefits
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   in these communities, build on FDR's second bill of rights by guaranteeing a job with
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   family-sustaining wage, family and medical leave, vacations and retirement security,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   high-quality education including higher education and trade schools, clean air and water and
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   access to nature, healthy food, high-quality healthcare, safe, affordable, adequate housing,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   economic environment free of monopolies, economic security for all who are unable or unwilling
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   to work." Now I'm reading directly from the Green New Deal Frequently Asked Questions
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   which was, according to the top of it, was scheduled to be launched on Thursday, February
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   7th at 8.30am. And it was a little bit later on February 7th when I pulled that document
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   from the official website after reading about it on an NPR story. Now today that document
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   is disputed. It's said that that document is not, that's not the official legislation
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   etc. You can dig into that. It's all lies. Now let's move on to here's what's most important
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   for you to hear from this particular document. Listen carefully to this Frequently Asked
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Question quoting from the document. "How will you pay for it? "The same way we paid
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   for the New Deal, the 2008 Bank Bailout and extended quantitative easing programs. The
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   same way we paid for World War II and all our current wars. The Federal Reserve can
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   extend credit to power these projects and investments and new public banks can be created
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   to extend credit. There is also space for the government to take an equity stake in
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   projects to get a return on investment. At the end of the day, this is an investment
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   in our economy that should grow our wealth as a nation. So the question isn't how we
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   will pay for it, but what will we do with our new shared prosperity." Now think back
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   to the three methods that the government has of creating money or revenue. Taxation, borrowing
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   or inflation. Think back to our discussion on taxation and notice what is missing from
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   here, from this Frequently Asked Question. Now I continue reading with the very next
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Frequently Asked Question. "Why do we need a sweeping Green New Deal investment program?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Why can't we just rely on regulations and taxes and the private sector to invest a loan
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   such as a carbon tax or a ban on fossil fuels?" Continuing verbatim quoting, "The level
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   of investment required is massive. Even if every billionaire and company came together
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment, the
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient. The speed of
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   investment required will be massive. Even if all the billionaires and companies could
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   make the investments required, they would not be able to pull together a coordinated
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   response in the narrow window of time required to jumpstart major new projects and major
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   new economic sectors. Also, private companies are wary of making massive investments in
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   unproven research and technologies. The government, however, has the time horizon to be able to
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   patiently make investments in new tech and R&D without necessarily having a commercial
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   outcome or application in mind at the time the investment is made." Skipping down a little bit.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Dropping down a few paragraphs. "Once again, we're not saying there isn't a role for private
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   sector investments. We're just saying the level of investment required will need every
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   actor to pitch in and that the government is best placed to be the prime driver."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Back to the sentence I said before. "Even if all the billionaires and companies could
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   make the investments required," or different sentence, "Even if every billionaire and
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   company came together and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   this investment, the aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient."
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Now, the document is very poorly written. And when I first read it, I laughed. I thought
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   it was a joke. And then I started looking at it and I said, "Wait a second." I said,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   "This has got to be a joke. I'm being trolled here. I'm being fooled. This is a joke."
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "No, mainstream news site, mainstream news site." So I checked all my documents.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Now, here are the public statements about this particular document referencing some
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   of these mainstream news articles, etc. You have Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a current
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   declared presidential candidate. "A Green New Deal is ambitious, it's bold, and I'm
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   co-sponsoring this resolution with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   because it's exactly the kind of action it will take to conquer the biggest threat of
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   our lifetime." Senator Cory Booker signs on, officially endorses it. Senator Kamala Harris,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   "I'm proud to co-sponsor this document with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and Senator Ed Markey. It's a Green New Deal. We must aggressively tackle climate
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   change which poses an existential threat to our nation." Senator Elizabeth Warren,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   declared candidate for leading, all these, by the way, these four leading candidates
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   for the Democratic presidential nomination. "If we want to live in a world with clean
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   air and water, we have to take real action to combat climate change now. I'm proud to
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   join Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey on a Green New Deal
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   resolution to fight for our planet and our kids' futures." So, in the United States
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   of America, we have one political party that is content with running trillion dollar deficits
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   in a time of economic prosperity where nobody wishes to show any fiscal constraint,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   at least that I can find, and we have another political party that wishes to completely
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   transform the U.S. American economy. Now, I appreciate realism in political leaders.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I really do. I appreciate that there are political leaders in the Democratic Party
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   that are somewhat dismissive of this particular type of approach. But when you have
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   major, when you have all of the energy is focused on this particular set of legislation,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   these particular ideas, it's very worrying in terms of our ability in the next five years
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   to get to the point of freezing the U.S. debt at 95% of GDP. I count that as impossible.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Now, here's what I would ask of you. Don't believe or disbelieve me. Don't necessarily
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   argue with me on these particular points. Rather, watch what's happening over the next
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   six months, over the next year, over the next couple of years. Recognize the absolute impossibility
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   as that as Riedel talked about in the article reference, the political suicide of anybody
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   getting involved just simply to try to freeze things in a bad situation. Recognize that,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   as Riedel wrote, I repeat, my plan as written is political suicide. And this is probably
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   the most politically plausible plan that could probably solve, could probably solve,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   the long term problem. And even this would be political suicide. It raises taxes across
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   the board. It restrains Social Security and Medicare. It allows defense to continue falling
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   as a percentage of GDP. And yet it's political suicide. I want to read back to the Reason
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   article. I want to read the next question from, the next two questions from the interview.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Reason asks this, "By the mid 2030s, there are going to be benefit cuts in Social Security.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   That's not 2023, but maybe there's some sort of a political trigger there that can push
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   things?" Riedel, "In 2034, the Social Security Trust Fund goes bankrupt and will require
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   an automatic 20% benefit cut. That's written in the law. The danger is, if we wait until
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   2034 to fix Social Security, we're dead. By that point, we will have already had a
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   substantial debt crisis." Reason, "How do you expect that debt crisis to unfold?"
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Riedel, "The danger is that if the debt keeps growing, at a certain point investors
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   will stop lending us money at reasonable interest rates. They will be reasonably concerned
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   that the debt is growing beyond our ability to finance it. They will demand higher interest
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   rates, and every one percentage point increase in interest rates will add $13 trillion in
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   interest costs over 30 years. As interest rates go up, we will have to borrow even more
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   to make the interest payments, which causes the debt to go even higher. At a certain point,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   the investors will demand that we get our fiscal house in order. It will likely start
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   with low-hanging fruit, tax hikes for the rich for example, but those won't be enough.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Eventually, you'll be left with two choices, either significantly raise taxes on the middle
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   class, or significantly cut benefits to current seniors. If we do neither, you will have a
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   major financial crisis. What that looks like remains to be seen, because we've never seen
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   an international power with such a huge economy go through what we are about to go through."
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   In the years that I have been paying attention to finances, years as a financial advisor,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and now years doing radical personal finance, I have never wanted, ever wanted to be an
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   extremist on issues like this. I have resisted it, I have rejected it, I have never wanted
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   to be lumped in with all of the other extremists. I've never wanted it. But at some point
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   in time, you've got to look at the data. And I would invite you to look at the data
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   for yourself, and to watch what happens in the coming six months, or year, etc.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   For me, I have decided that this entire realm of risk has to be moved from possible risks
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   to probable risks. Now, I don't know the extent of the risk, I don't know the extent
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   of the crack in the bridge, but when you look at this stuff and you say, an open, careful
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   analysis looks at it and says, "The numbers, everything is wrong in the numbers," and
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   a finger in the wind, to dope the wind to find out what's happening in the political
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   environment says, "All of the pressure in the political environment is wrong."
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I sure hope I'm wrong, but as far as I'm concerned, this is a ticking bomb that will
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   likely go off during my lifetime. Now, that's a big scant van of time, and I don't know.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   But I do know this, there are solutions. There are ways to protect yourself against
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   this, and I consider the risks efficient to not sit around and waste time, and not sit
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   around and not take action. I'm responsible for protecting those in my household, and
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   for caring for them. And let me tell you this, I have studied this subject, and the reality
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   of life in this kind of world is not pretty. Just last week, I was talking with a family
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   who was on vacation from Argentina, and there are a couple of current, basically ongoing
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   collapses that I have watched. It's all well and good for me to read about the Weimar Republic,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   but that was decades and decades and decades ago, and it's just not current. I can't
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   look at that on the internet, I have to read classical books and historically written books.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   But the ones that I have watched have been Argentina and Venezuela, what is currently
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   happening in both of those countries. And I was recently speaking with an Argentinian
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   family, and we were just talking about what's actually happening, and what's actually
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   happened in Argentina. And I won't share too much, but just put it this way, it is
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   awful. Living in Argentina right now is terrible. It is absolutely terrible, and you fear for
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   your life on a daily basis. Living in Venezuela right now is terrible. You fear for your life
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   on a daily basis. I've had a couple of friends from Venezuela who sought refuge in
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   the United States, and you hear some of the stories from their family and whatnot who
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   is still stuck in Venezuela. It is absolutely terrible. And as difficult as it is for me
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   to believe that the United States of America can go down the same path as a Venezuela
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   or an Argentina, the cold, logical side of me says, "These are not the Weimar Republic."
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Most especially and importantly, Argentina. Argentina is an incredible country, massive
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   country with huge wealth, and yet look at where things have been for the last almost
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   two decades now in Argentina. So, in coming days, I will share with you more on solutions
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   for it. But here's what you need to be prepared for. You need to be prepared for
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   higher taxes. What is your plan to escape those higher taxes, lest they ruin your wealth?
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Number two, you need to be prepared for loss of programs, loss of benefits. If you are
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   counting on Medicare, if you are counting on Social Security, if you're counting on
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   those things to prop you up, read the math. I would say read the tea leaves, but tea leaves
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   are not nearly as reliable as math. Read the math. You can't count on it. It absolutely
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   will change. The benefits will change. They have to change. And in fact, one of the things
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   that I've been fascinated by is I watch reproduction rates. And in the United States
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   as well as in much of the world, birth rates have fallen so much that in many ways the
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   disaster could be even worse. And when you compound that with problems of immigration,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   anyway, read the math. So don't count on government programs. You have to have a plan
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   to provide for yourself. And you have to have a plan to get out and provide for yourself
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   and your family should we face a worst case scenario of currency mass inflation and/or
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   hyperinflation because that is what destroys a society.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I have finished the outline for the course, the next course that I am launching. The outline,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   this particular course is called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Collapse,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   a Rational Modern Approach. Again, it's How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Collapse, a Rational Modern Approach. In just a minute, I'll give you a coupon code if you'd
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   like to get in early and buy the course and save some money. I'll tell you how to do that
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   in just a moment. But let me tell you why I wrote this course. I consider at this point
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   in time, it's my analysis, that the problems that we discussed won't be solved by the political
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   regime that we currently have. I don't see how it's possible that they could be solved.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   The people proposing solutions, the most optimistic of them don't actually solve much and I don't
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   see any discussion of actual solutions. So I don't see how it's possible that they be
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   solved. But the problem is, when do the problems start to reveal themselves? And that's a maddening
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   problem. If I thought that tomorrow, my neighbors were going to start shooting me for food,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   then I would probably do things a little bit differently. I've interviewed a lot of people
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   on this show, many of whom come from that perspective. One of the questions, Jim Rawls,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   James Wesley Rawls has been on the show a couple of times. One of the things I've always
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   posed to him is, "Jim, how do you have such certainty about the certainty of collapse?"
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   He's very strong on his level of certainty scale. I'm generally uncomfortable with those
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   kinds of levels of certainty. But if I thought that, then maybe I would be willing to move
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   to the boonies and live in a cabin with my family. But at this point in time, it's hard.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   It's very hard for me in the life that I want to live to conceive that it's right for me
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   to move to the mountains and live in a cabin or to build a nuclear bunker under the world.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   I respect those who do, but it's hard for me to fit that into my optimism for life and
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   to figure out how does this actually integrate. And so the problem that you face is, number
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   one, what do you do? And number two, how much money do you spend? Do you take all your money
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   out of the stock market and say, "Well, I'm going to go and buy food and guns so I can
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   live during the coming economic collapse?" Some people do. I have a hard time giving
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   that advice to people because I consider the timing to be so uncertain on these kinds of
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   affairs that it's just very uncertain. So in many ways, I'd rather have an insurance
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   policy if it were possible to have an insurance policy. And I'd rather have a plan that could
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   develop in time rather than my freaking out and moving to the top of a mountain or buying
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   a missile silo in Montana and moving into it, a decommissioned missile silo. I think
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   those things are cool, but that's not right for me right now. And so what I've outlined
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   in this particular course is my best solution, which is basically run away from problems.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   But here's how you run away from the problems in a thoughtful, intelligent way. And that's
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   what it is, how to survive and thrive during the coming economic collapse. So what I am
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   doing right now is putting in place all of the infrastructure necessary in order for
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   my family and me to survive and thrive during the coming economic collapse. And to me, this
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   seems to be the most rational perspective to take, is to say, "I think that there can
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   be problems. I acknowledge that the problems are probable. I don't know the timing of
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   those problems. So let me have a plan that I can adjust and adapt over time that allows
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   me to live well if everything goes wrong or live well if nothing goes wrong." Because
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   when we put things into historical perspective and you recognize that since the 1970s and
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   since the 1980s and since the 1990s and since before that, people have been preaching gloom
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   and doom from the mountaintop and yet it hasn't happened, I think it should give us today
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   a little bit more caution to preach gloom and doom and say, "By the end of this year,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   it's all going to fall apart." I don't think that's the case. So I would invite you at
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   this point in time, if this is interesting to you, to come by radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   click on "Store" and follow the link for my newest course called "How to Survive
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   and Thrive During the Coming Economic Collapse." I am launching that course on – well, you

[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   a little bit of insight, my working outline which you will download, my just simple outline

[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   with basically everything that I know of and can think of to share with you, to help you
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   put in place a robust and vigorous plan. And I think you'll find it to be a tremendous,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   tremendous value. I've worked very hard on it. I have recorded – I finished recording
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   about two-thirds of the content right now for the course videos. Within the next couple
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   of weeks, at least the first several of those videos will be launched by March 15. They'll
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   be edited and uploaded so they'll be ready to go for you. So if you would like to buy
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   during the prelaunch sale, I would invite you to come by radicalpersonalfinance.com,

[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   the things that I – reasons that I'm doing this is I would like to have a bunch of you
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   lined up to start that on March 15 because I'm going to be very active in answering
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   the questions and discussing with you during the first couple of months of this particular
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   course because although this is my plan and this is what I'm doing, I want to help you
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   also put in place practical plans for you. And one of the things you'll appreciate about
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   the course is everything in it is very scalable. You don't have to have a million bucks.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   You got to have at least a few thousand bucks. If you don't have a few thousand bucks,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   that's your first thing. Don't worry about economic collapse if you're worried about
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   being kicked out of your house. Go and do something else and fix that problem and then
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   come. But you don't have to have a million bucks to be prepared for this. So go to radicalpersonfinance.com,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   click on the store and join me for the prelaunch. Again, prelaunchdiscount is the coupon code
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   that will save you 25% off and expect us to talk about this more in coming years. I will
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   tell you this. First, my plan doesn't involve spending money that I would regret. And that's
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   one of the things I've tried very hard to do is to not let doom and gloom thinking cause
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   me to have regret. I think sometimes that can happen to people. If you don't want to
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   live out in the country in a missile bunker, then don't. But if you want to live in a
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   missile bunker, then you can do it without regret. So the point is, I don't want to spend
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   a bunch of money or a bunch of problems on something that I might regret. I've got to
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   have a plan that works if history of the future turns out to be much the way it has been for
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   past decades. If everything goes well during my life, I can't have a very expensive plan
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   that all falls apart. But on the other hand, I can't sit around with my head in the sand.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   And at this point, you can see that in the last six months since that particular article
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   and study was published, nothing good has come of it. No, no, no, no. National public
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   conversation between centrist Republicans and Democrats is happening. Nobody's talking
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   about fiscal restraint. If anything, it's getting worse. So the data is indicating yellow
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   and red lights all across the board. Now is time for you to provide for yourself. And
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   I need to say one last caveat as I close the show. This should factor into your investment
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   plans, but you always have to remember that the government is not the market. Companies
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   and governments are different. Now, how that works out varies depending on the actual circumstances
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   involved in. But I always try to be very careful. I'm not talking about the stocks or stock
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   market. I'm talking about the federal budget. And that is a key distinction. So talk with
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   your financial advisor about your stocks. I'm not here to do that today. Here today,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   I'm just simply here to say it's time, mom. If you see people talking about how to defuse
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   it, let's be very optimistic because I don't want to go through an economic collapse. But
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   at this point, I think prudence indicates it's time to prepare so that we survive and
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   thrive during what by all accounts seems to be a future economic collapse. Go to radical
