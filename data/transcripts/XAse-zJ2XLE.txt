[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   It's not impossible to convert all of your spend
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.620]   to welcome bonuses, but for me,
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.100]   I'm probably gonna end up with a hybrid approach
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.940]   where I maximize my return on the spend from cards
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.740]   in line with what I've done in my card tool
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.140]   without focusing on welcome bonuses.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.900]   But three to four times a year,
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.820]   when we see an amazing welcome bonus, we'll jump on it,
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.180]   especially if it's one that might have a lower rate of return
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.860]   than 15 to 25 points per dollar,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.980]   but that has a high amount of spending
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.540]   and even bigger bonus.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.560]   So yes, you might get the best bonus
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.440]   for 25,000 points on $2,000,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.700]   but I'm much more interested in a 250,000 points
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.820]   on $20,000 bonus because I get a similar return,
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.880]   but only having to open up one card to spend a lot more
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.060]   and get a much bigger bonus.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.620]   So I'm gonna be focusing on the absolute point return
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.880]   instead of necessarily ROI for each welcome bonus.
