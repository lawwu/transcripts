[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220]   Is the first commandment and the last commandment essentially the same
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.260]   commandment? It's a question worth thinking about as John Piper recently
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.400]   explained in a sermon. Here's how he posed the question and explained the
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.380]   implications. Have you ever asked the question whether the first of the Ten
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.780]   Commandments and the last of the Ten Commandments are the same commandment?
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.740]   I wonder if you can remember what they are. So the first commandment is, "You shall
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.860]   have no other gods before me." Exodus 20 verse 3. And the last one is, "You shall
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:58.980]   not covet." Paul says, Colossians 3:5, "Put away all covetousness which is
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.900]   idolatry." Oh, so the first and last commandments are the same commandment.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.460]   Only the last one bends it out horizontally so you know what's really
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.740]   going on. Let's try to define these commandments. So the first commandment is,
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.900]   "You shall not have any other gods before me." What does that mean?
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.700]   The words surrounding it, verse 5, "I am the Lord your God. I am a jealous God."
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.580]   So, okay, put jealousy together with, "You shall not have any gods before me." God is
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.180]   like a husband. Israel is like a wife, and he's jealous if she consorts
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.740]   with another man, God, another God. And so what does not have any other gods before
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.420]   you mean? It means your love, your affection, your delight belong to me, God
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.660]   says. It's belonging to me, only me. You can't mix it up. All throughout the Old
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.940]   Testament, idolatry was called adultery. So you're giving your affections away.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.940]   You're desiring things more than you're desiring me. I'm jealous. A husband ought
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.500]   to feel that. Jealousy is only a sin when it's all out of proportion and in the
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.220]   wrong places. A husband who sees his wife fall in love with another man and
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.540]   doesn't feel jealous is sick. He should feel rage of jealous, and he should win
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.420]   her back, and she should repent. God feels rage at his idolatrous people, and wrath
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.780]   comes from God. The last commandment is "you shall not covet," and Paul quotes it
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.060]   that way. He doesn't just say, "Covet your neighbor's wife, covet your whatever."
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.540]   He just, in Romans 7, he says, "The commandment, you shall not covet." What
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.020]   does "covet" mean? I remember as a kid trying to define "covet," and I never
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.980]   could. I always thought, "Well, it means want what you have. I want what you have."
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.900]   That's not what "covet" means. "Covet" is much more widely used than just
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.220]   wanting what somebody else has. And what's interesting is that in the Old
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.940]   Testament and the New, the Hebrew and the Greek, the word simply means "desire." And
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.060]   so the question then is, "Well, when does desire become covet?" Because desires
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.940]   aren't bad. You can desire what's good, and you can desire what's bad. So
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.740]   when does a desire along the way, either in intensity or for
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.820]   something, when does it become bad? When does it become the coveting kind of
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.620]   desire? And my way of answering that is to take the tenth commandment and put it
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.140]   together with what we just said about the first commandment. Paul says "covet"
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.380]   is idolatry, and we've just seen God as jealous for his wife's affection
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.500]   and attention and glorification and love and devotion and treasuring. And here we
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.340]   have covetous called idolatry, and it's just desire for anything. So
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:43.380]   here's my attempt at a definition based on that connection. I would say don't
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:53.500]   desire anything in a way that would express lack of contentment in God.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.140]   Covetousness is a desire that is going up because the desire for
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:10.500]   God is going down. For anything, for Bible reading, preaching, writing books,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.940]   anything that you desire and the desire is coming stronger because the desire
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.700]   for God is getting weaker, that's covetousness. It's evil. Doesn't matter
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.660]   what you're desiring. And so I think what we've seen from Romans 1 and now from
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:37.340]   the Ten Commandments is where our exchange for the glory of God, the value
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.860]   of God, the beauty of God, the all-satisfying worth of God, where that
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.620]   exchange is happening and our desire for Him and our satisfaction in Him is
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.820]   getting weaker, other desires are going to come in to fill the void and
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.700]   they get stronger, all that's called covetousness. Wow, that is quite a clip
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.740]   and it's a little window into everything we do at Desiring God as well. This
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.220]   message excerpt was taken from a message given last summer in a series titled
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.940]   "Living in the Light with Money, Sex, and Power." A four-part series, three messages
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.400]   and one Q&A, all available at DesiringGod.org right now. And those
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.380]   messages of course became the new book, "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.340]   A nice little hardcover available now at Amazon and downloadable free of charge at
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.420]   DesiringGod.org/books. Well, we show caution with our words,
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.620]   especially when those words are about other people. So how should we talk with
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.700]   our spouses about relational conflicts we may be having without gossiping about
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.060]   the people we struggle with? This is a really important question and it's asked
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.460]   of John Piper tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.740]   Ask Pastor John podcast with author and longtime pastor John Piper. We'll see you
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.860]   tomorrow.
