[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   I totally understand coming from a monolingual English country, that you just think to yourself
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.800]   that I don't have the language gene.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.960]   Other people have it, I don't have it.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.960]   Or I did not grow up speaking a language, so it's too late, I'm past whatever the cutoff
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.120]   age is for learning a language.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.600]   And a lot of people say these things to themselves, and that truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.920]   The more you embrace these reasons that you're going to fail, the more you essentially make
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520]   them true.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.360]   And I always like to think what Henry Ford said once, "Whether you think you can or think
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.520]   you can't, you're right."
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.600]   And I think that's very true with language learning.
