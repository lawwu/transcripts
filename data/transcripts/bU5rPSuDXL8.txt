[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.880]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast number 42.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.160]   Today our special guest is Spencer Jacob.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520]   Spencer is the editor of the Wall Street Journal Heard
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.800]   on the Street column and the author of a new book,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680]   The Revolution That Wasn't--
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.320]   GameStop, Reddit, and the Fleecing of Small Investors.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:38.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.640]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.600]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.680]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.240]   that you can find at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.040]   Your tax-deductible contributions
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280]   are greatly appreciated.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.320]   The Bogleheads were formed in 1998
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.640]   on the Morningstar message board before moving
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   to its current site at bogleheads.org.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.560]   The founder of the Bogleheads is Taylor Larimore.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.800]   Taylor is a highly decorated World War II paratrooper
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.120]   from the 101st Airborne Division,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.440]   where he fought in the Battle of the Bulge.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680]   He is 98 years old this month.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.440]   And on behalf of all the Bogleheads,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.480]   we wish you a happy birthday and many more.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.880]   One year ago this month, something phenomenal
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.720]   happened in the stock market that was called
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   by some the Reddit revolution.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080]   Millions of individual investors, mostly young men,
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.400]   banded together on a Reddit message board called Wall
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   Street Bets to take down a couple of large hedge funds
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   who had gone short companies that they
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.380]   thought were down and out.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.680]   The phenomenal story of what happened next
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240]   and the ultimate demise of many of these small investors
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   is a fascinating tale.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.080]   Here to tell us about it today is Spencer Jacob.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.000]   Welcome to the podcast, Spencer.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.600]   Thanks for having me, Rick.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.760]   It's a real pleasure to have you on this podcast.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400]   I've been following a lot of your work,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.840]   including your previous book.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.360]   And this book is really interesting.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120]   I put it up there with Roger Lowenstein's
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   When Genius Fails, which talks about long-term capital
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.960]   management.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.600]   Here we are 25 years later and something new on Wall Street.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.200]   But before we get to your newest book, The Revolution That
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.480]   Wasn't, talk about your background and your past.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.840]   How did you get into The Wall Street Journal
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.760]   and writing books?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.400]   And tell us a little bit about yourself.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.060]   Well, first of all, thank you very much.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.960]   I'm blushing to be compared to the author of When Genius
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.460]   Failed.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.400]   It's one of my favorite financial books,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.640]   a great account of the whole LTCM debacle.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.840]   Lowenstein takes this really complicated thing
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.720]   and puts a human face on it and simplifies it.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.880]   And that's what I always try to do when I write.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   And so if I accomplished anything on that scale,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.560]   that's great.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.520]   Back when LTCM happened, when that story happened,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.720]   I was a director and later would become a managing director
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.640]   in equity research at an investment bank.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.200]   I was working in emerging markets.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   A year or two in emerging markets is like a dog year.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.520]   You see a lot of stuff.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.080]   So what you might see once or twice or three times
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.280]   in a career on normal Wall Street,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.100]   you'll see 10 times in emerging markets.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.520]   You saw panic and euphoria and all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.720]   and crime and whatever.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.460]   And that's what I spent the first 10 years of my career
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.200]   doing.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   I ran a team of emerging market analysts at Credit Suisse.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.120]   And I just got bored with it.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.100]   I found all this stuff really interesting.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.680]   And more and more, I just found myself
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.320]   managing people and talking to clients.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.720]   And I had saved money.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.960]   I was pretty frugal.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.640]   So what I'd really like to do is write about it.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   And I wonder how I could do that.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.400]   And I met a woman on a plane who was a longtime Wall Street
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.840]   Journal reporter.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.000]   Two days later, I was in the office speaking with her.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.960]   Three days later, I was writing my first column
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.480]   for Dow Jones Newswires.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.320]   I wrote several pieces for Barron's magazine.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.760]   I worked for the Financial Times.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.540]   And the last 10 years, I've been a columnist at the Wall Street
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.440]   Journal, where I run the Herd on the Street column, which
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.880]   is our financial analysis and opinion column.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.760]   It's 14 people around the world.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.880]   I love my job.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.160]   It's much more interesting than being an analyst.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.740]   Unfortunately, it does not pay as well.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.080]   But I get to write books on the side, which is also nice.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.560]   And this is my second book and the latest one.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   One of the things that interests me about you
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.700]   is you were heavily involved in the dartboard contest.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.640]   Basically, Burton Malkiel saying monkeys
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.920]   throwing darts at a dartboard would outperform
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.720]   most of the active managers.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360]   Can you tell me about that whole contest
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.220]   at the Wall Street Journal?
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.960]   Well, Burton was very kind to write a really nice blurb
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.680]   for this book.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.560]   And the dartboard contest is something
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.960]   that ran for many, many years.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.040]   When I was in graduate school at Columbia University,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.080]   I was introduced to it.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   And that was towards the tail end
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.160]   of the original dartboard contest.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   So he said in a random walk down Wall Street
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.280]   that monkeys throwing darts at a dartboard
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.960]   would do as well as mutual fund managers.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.000]   And he basically is correct.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.600]   They actually do better because monkeys are free
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.160]   or don't cost very much.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.280]   So we decided to revive that.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.940]   And you might be aware that every year there's
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.140]   a big hedge fund conference in New York City called the Soane
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.660]   Investment Conference, where people pay $5,000 to be there.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.420]   And they'll invite journalists for free.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.960]   But $5,000 to be there sitting in the room when Bill Ackman
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.580]   and all these other people, and a couple
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.020]   of characters who show up in this book, by the way,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.620]   go and give their best ideas.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.180]   And they'll say, I like this stock,
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.020]   or I don't like this stock.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.540]   And the stock will move immediately.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.060]   And I said, I wonder how those do in the long run.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.180]   Or I wonder how we would do throwing darts
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.940]   at the stock listings.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.500]   And those don't exist in very many papers anymore.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.860]   Barron's Magazine, our sister publication, still does it.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.060]   So I got my whole team and bought darts at Modell's
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.860]   on 42nd Street for $9.99.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.700]   They had no monkeys, so we had to do it.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.100]   And yeah, we did it two years in a row.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.660]   Both years, we beat the pros by an embarrassingly large margin.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.540]   I remember the first year, it was 22 percentage points.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.300]   And not only did the pros not beat us,
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.680]   but they didn't beat the market in either of those years.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.740]   And they generally do not.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.300]   And it just illustrates a deep truth
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.900]   about investing, which is that there is such a thing
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.180]   as expertise, but it's very, very hard to find.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.020]   And you're better off usually not really chasing it.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.980]   And also, why would they invest your money if they're
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.180]   really that good, right?
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.580]   Yeah, and for that matter, why would some stranger
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.300]   with a pseudonym on a Reddit message board, which
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.780]   is the whole phenomenon that I'm writing about in this book,
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.900]   have any good advice?
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.940]   And might it even be self-serving advice?
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.620]   You don't know who that person is.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.280]   Well, before we get into the book,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.940]   and we're going to go through the book,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.180]   because it is a great story, we need to define some terminology
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.260]   and define who the players were, who the companies were,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.900]   who the characters were in this story,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.300]   because listeners may not be familiar.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.700]   The first thing that comes up is a mem stock, M-E-M-E.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.680]   What is a mem stock?
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.720]   Did I say that by the way?
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.460]   Is it a meme stock or is it a mem stock?
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.500]   Pronunciations vary.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.460]   I think meme might be the more common one.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.140]   I think mem is technically correct,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.900]   and meme is the more common one.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.140]   What is a meme, first of all?
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.460]   Meme is something where it's a picture
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.380]   from a movie or some cartoon or just some humorous illustration
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.620]   that, instead of words, you use that picture, perhaps
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.620]   with some text attached, to convey something.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.460]   So like, you'll take a movie poster
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.260]   and you'll change it to make your point or to make a joke.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.780]   And so memes or mems are something
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.100]   that young people love to send around.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   I've got three sons, and my youngest recently informed me
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.980]   that I can't make a meme because, by definition, I'm
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.700]   just too old.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.460]   I showed him some funny thing on my phone.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.860]   He said, that can't be a meme because you showed it to me.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.940]   It's therefore not a meme.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.020]   But people on these message boards love to exchange memes.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.900]   They love to convey messages in them.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.060]   And so the mem stocks were a bunch of down and out stocks,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.700]   companies on the ropes, some going bankrupt,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.780]   that star in this episode.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.740]   OK, now Elon Musk sort of made a famous quote in this book.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.340]   And I recall him calling one of those stocks--
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.900]   the stock was GameStop, but he called it GameStonk, S-T-O-N-K.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.540]   What is a stonk?
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.420]   Let's say you're a young person and you
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.860]   don't think that the stock market is very cool,
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.100]   but you think it's kind of fun to dabble in it.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.640]   Then you call it a stonk.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.380]   And a stonk is something that you kind of buy as a joke,
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.340]   that you don't take too seriously.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.600]   And there is a meme about people buying stonks.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.420]   It's like a really crude drawing.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.220]   You might see if you just Google it, do stonks, you'll see it.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.260]   It's like a computer graphics circa 1993 of a--
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.900]   or whatever, of a guy standing there
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.340]   with an arrow going up and a chart behind him.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.660]   And that's where the stonk thing comes from.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.540]   And that tweet of his, which is I remember what it was,
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.980]   it was 4:08 PM on January 26, 2021,
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.820]   set the financial world on fire.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.740]   This episode was going on.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.940]   It was already a crazy, crazy story.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.780]   And because he's so widely followed, especially
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.700]   among this cohort, it was like there was this forest fire,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.820]   and then he just dumped a ton of nitroglycerin on top of it.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.260]   That's kind of what his tweet did.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.460]   OK, the next couple are a bit around a long time.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.100]   There's a lot in the book, and a lot of the story
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.380]   is about the shorts, the people who are shorting the stock
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.020]   or did short the stock.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.660]   And so just for our listeners' clarity,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.340]   what's a shorting a stock?
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.340]   What does that mean?
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.420]   Well, shorting a stock, I'll tell you what it is,
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.620]   and I'll tell you why it's especially important here.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.420]   Shorting a stock is the opposite of what most people do,
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.180]   you and I do, with funds or with stocks.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.340]   We buy them, and we hope that they'll go up in value
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.580]   and pay a nice dividend.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.900]   They do the opposite.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.220]   And they're not evil, because they do that.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.900]   But they're basically making a bet
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.140]   that a stock will go down in value.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.060]   And the way to do that generally is to not own the stock,
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.580]   but to borrow it from somebody.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.740]   Usually, you borrow it without them even knowing it.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.740]   You just go to their broker.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.440]   It's not illegal or nefarious.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.660]   And you then sell it to somebody else.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.020]   So you benefit from the price going down.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.380]   But if I go out and buy a share of IBM,
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.740]   the worst thing that can happen is tomorrow, IBM
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.660]   is mired in an accounting scandal,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.300]   and their share price goes to zero, and I lost all my money.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.680]   The best thing that can happen is
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.380]   it's worth a trillion dollars tomorrow,
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.380]   and I make a lot of money.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.900]   But they face the opposite situation,
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.620]   where if a stock starts to go up, they start to lose money.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.260]   And since they tend to move in packs,
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.180]   if a stock goes up unexpectedly for no reason
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.620]   or for some reason, there's something
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.980]   called a short squeeze, which happened here.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.860]   And that's probably an understatement here.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.080]   It's like a bunch of people being in a theater,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.900]   and there's one door where they can get out,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.420]   except this theater was on fire.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.820]   And some people lit the fire on purpose.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.900]   It wasn't something that just was in the news.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.120]   They doused the whole place in kerosene.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.940]   They agreed to do this on the internet,
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.420]   and these guys all had to go out,
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.780]   and there was only one exit door,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.380]   and they all trampled each other.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.280]   And some funds lost billions of dollars,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.820]   like some of the most respected funds on Wall Street
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.740]   lost massive amounts of money,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.700]   and it was all part of the plan.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.420]   And they had to buy the stock no matter what.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.980]   - Right, you either buy it back or go to prison, correct?
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.460]   - That's the old saying, yeah.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.620]   He who sells who isn't his must buy it back or go to prison.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.180]   - Okay, now one more thing.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.700]   I mean, so we talked about shorting stock,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.940]   and thank you for that explanation.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.500]   And let's talk about call options.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   What are call options,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.340]   and how do they affect the price of a stock?
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.420]   - So call options play a big role in this story, too.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   And call options basically are something,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.140]   call options are basically a contract
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.800]   between you and somebody else.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.100]   A call option is saying, let's say the stock
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.380]   is at $100 that you are interested in.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.460]   You say, I'm going to give myself the option
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.340]   of buying it at $110 in a month.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.620]   I'm gonna write a contract with you,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.420]   and it probably won't get to $110 in a month,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.940]   and you sell me a contract.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.700]   You say, okay, that's a deal.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.020]   I'll sell it to you at $110 a month.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.860]   Let's say that this company cures cancer,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.920]   and it goes to $500.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.620]   Well, I still get to buy it for $110
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.060]   because I signed that contract with you.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.500]   So I make the difference.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.880]   I probably put down a tiny amount of money
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.480]   for that contract, and I get all the difference in price.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.940]   So it's almost like a lottery ticket at times
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.020]   that you can buy.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.220]   Now, that's not the main way that they're used,
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.160]   but it is the main way that they are used
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.300]   by this newest class of investors
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.860]   as a purely speculative instrument.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.500]   There are also put options, which do the opposite.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.660]   It gives you the option to sell.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.020]   But the person who sells you the option
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.440]   is taking a pretty big risk, right?
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.500]   That company cures cancer.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.380]   They have a big problem.
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.700]   So they have ways of protecting themselves.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.300]   They're not in the business of taking that risk.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.620]   So they do things, and the things that they do
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.040]   play a role in this story as well.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.620]   - And the seller of the option gets a small premium,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.460]   and most of the time,
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.920]   these options just expire worthless, correct?
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.860]   - Yeah, options are seen as the ultimate retail investor,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.640]   soccer's bat, and during the time
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.260]   that this story takes place,
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.580]   tens of billions, record-shattering amounts
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.180]   of call options were purchased
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.580]   by people who were mostly not very sophisticated at all.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.380]   - Okay, so we did mem stocks.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.780]   We did what a stonk is, shorting stock, call options.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.020]   Now we can get into companies involved in this story,
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.340]   and the first company we have to look at is Robinhood.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.380]   Who is Robinhood?
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.900]   - So Robinhood steals from the rich to give to the poor.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.360]   Great name if you want to be a financial services company
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.200]   for young people.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.140]   It's a great name for a company.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.600]   It's a great idea for a company.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.720]   They have a great app.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.320]   The year that it came out, in 2015, it won app of the year.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.860]   It's slick, it's intuitive.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.120]   It's a brokerage house, but it's really,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.360]   it's an app with a broker attached to it.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.400]   That's how I see it, as opposed to whatever broker
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.320]   most people on this might use,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.440]   where they have a brokerage,
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.520]   and then there's also an app
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.960]   that they can use for convenience.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.100]   The story is backwards.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.800]   They designed this app, they showed it to people,
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   and they had a huge waiting list
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.120]   before they even had it going,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.000]   mainly of college students and people on that age group.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.840]   - Somebody mentioned it
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.520]   as the gamification of stock trading.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.720]   - It is, that's the criticism
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.280]   that this company has come under.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.840]   They said, "We want to make investing fun,"
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.280]   but I don't think that it's any accident
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.680]   how fun they made it.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.900]   For example, when you use Robinhood,
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.800]   you'll occasionally get confetti on your screen,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.640]   and they've disabled this since because of criticism.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   When you open a Robinhood account, and they still do this,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.120]   you get a free share of stock.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.960]   What stock?
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.760]   Well, could be a $5 stock,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.320]   could be a $200 stock, who knows?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.640]   It's like a lottery ticket.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.920]   And some people go in and open accounts
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.000]   with 20 bucks or 50 bucks.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.200]   So you put 20 bucks into an account,
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.840]   and you got a $200 stock, that's a pretty nice gift,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.640]   especially if you really only have 20 bucks to your name.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.160]   You just made 10 times your money.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.360]   So usually you don't,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.960]   but it's like a free little lottery ticket,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.240]   like a scratch-off card.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.500]   And there's a psychological lure to that.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.880]   And you open up Robinhood and see what's trending.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.760]   Like, hey, these are the 10 things
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   that people are talking about.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.140]   These are the stocks that are up a lot or down a lot.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.160]   Now, why is that important?
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.440]   Because, especially if you're a young person,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.480]   something that everybody else is doing and into,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.640]   just like when you go on YouTube
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.920]   and you see what's trending, right?
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.200]   You kind of fear missing out.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.640]   You're gonna see what the whole excitement is about, right?
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.480]   Things go viral, and things go viral in the stock market too.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.480]   And that virality is a big, big part of what's going on.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.360]   Now, Robinhood, from what I understand,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.520]   they don't charge commissions on these trades.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.720]   So how do they make money?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.080]   So these two young men,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.200]   and their names are Vlad Tenef and Bejubat,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.040]   who got together to start this company.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.800]   They had a little business helping hedge funds trade.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   And they said, you know what?
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.380]   It's incredible that trading costs almost nothing.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.840]   It basically has become free.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.560]   You know, you just hook up to a computer.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.800]   We could do that for people.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.280]   And they weren't the first company
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.640]   to realize that you could do this.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.360]   There were a couple of companies that came before them
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.600]   that said, "Hey, we'll have zero commissions."
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.520]   But they were the first to really make a success of it.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.920]   That sounds crazy, right?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   'Cause there's the old story
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.080]   about how much did you pay for that watch?
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.300]   Well, I got it for below wholesale.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.520]   How does a guy make money?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.480]   He sells a lot of watches.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.280]   That is kind of what their business sounds like
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.040]   'cause they're giving away trades for free
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.640]   and trading still costs something.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.960]   It costs a lot less than it used to,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.920]   but it still costs something.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.780]   So how on earth do they make money?
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.880]   And the way that they make money is part of the problem here.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   The way they make money is that
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.720]   they get money for those trades.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.200]   Instead of sending it to a stock exchange,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.720]   they send it to a wholesaler or a market maker
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.080]   that takes the trade and executes it,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.420]   doesn't rip off the customer by any means.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.240]   They do it legitimately.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.520]   And then they will pay the broker who sends them the money
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.760]   because the market maker can shave some fractions of a penny
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.080]   off for themselves.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.480]   And then they'll pay something to the broker
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.600]   that sent them the order.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.840]   And the vast majority of Robinhood's money
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.320]   has been made that way by getting paid by the broker.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.140]   And what does that mean?
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.200]   That means that they're not making money
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.480]   doing other things, providing other services to you.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.600]   They're making money mainly in two ways.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.840]   They're lending you money on margin.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.200]   So lending you money so you can borrow
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.480]   against your stock portfolio and speculate more.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.840]   And they're selling your orders.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   So they want you to trade a lot.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.720]   And they like it when you trade a lot.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   And so the whole app is,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.860]   according to lawsuits filed against Robinhood,
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.200]   is just designed to get you to trade a lot.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.680]   And we know from many, many, many studies
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.240]   that the more you trade, the worse you do.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.140]   The more you check, the worse you do.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.920]   People on Robinhood check their account
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.240]   eight times a day on average, on average.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.960]   And some people are constantly on the app.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.400]   They can't put it down.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.680]   - And I also read in your book
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.240]   that they trade 40 times as much volume of shares
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.560]   based on the amount of shares they have in their account
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.240]   as somebody at, let's say, Schwab or Fidelity would.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.820]   - Yes, that's right, yep.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.120]   - Well, okay, let's go to the next one,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.400]   which is this middleman who they sell trades to.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.080]   - And here's where some confusion comes into the story.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.480]   And this is, many conspiracies have been hatched from this.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   There's a company called Citadel LLC.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.160]   So Citadel is a hedge fund founded by Ken Griffin,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.960]   who's one of the richest men in America.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.200]   He started trading from his dorm room
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.320]   in Harvard University, so he was precocious.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.160]   And he actually made money in the 1987 stock market crash,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.280]   believe it or not, from his dorm room.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.020]   Very, very savvy guy.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.480]   And he had this business that was pretty small
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.400]   some years ago that, after the financial crisis,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.760]   started to get bigger and bigger,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.320]   which is called Citadel Securities,
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.160]   a separate business from his hedge fund,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.640]   but also called Citadel.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.960]   And it is now the biggest middleman like this.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   Not a stock exchange, but executing orders,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.440]   mainly for retail investors, not just at Robinhood,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.780]   but at other brokers too.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.080]   There are other companies in the business,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   Veer2, Susquehanna, but they're number one.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.560]   And Ken Griffin is kind of, especially by the people
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.760]   who felt a bit bitter about this whole story that I tell,
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.280]   is kind of the Darth Vader of the episode.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.660]   He's some kind of dark lord who has his hand
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.800]   in everything, supposedly, and made this whole thing happen,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.120]   which is not true.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.960]   But it's easy to see how that story was concocted,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   because he did make a lot of money.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.240]   This business, Citadel Securities, is private.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.680]   It recently got an investment valuing it at $22 billion,
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.220]   and he is by far the largest shareholder of this company.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.720]   So it has been a very, very profitable venture for him.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.200]   - Last is Reddit.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.520]   What's Reddit, and what is WallStreetBets?
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.520]   - So Reddit is a social media company.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.920]   It got started by two young men in a college dorm room,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   as so many tech companies do, at the University of Virginia.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.000]   It's Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.960]   They call themselves the front page of the internet.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.760]   It's different than other social networks in a lot of ways.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.100]   To just be clear, I like Reddit as a user,
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.840]   because there are about 100,000 communities on there,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.540]   about anything you might be interested in.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.640]   Reddit is one of the few things in social media
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.480]   that I really think can be good
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.880]   and a good sense of community,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.960]   but it also was the perfect breeding ground
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.520]   for this crazy story.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.480]   It has a bunch of sub-Reddits,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.360]   where people with very narrow interests
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.160]   and very similar mindsets can gather
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.400]   and exchange advice, exchange stories, using pseudonyms,
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.520]   so you don't know who anybody is.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.480]   It's not like Facebook or Twitter,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.040]   where you use your own name,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.160]   or usually use your own name,
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.580]   and then people follow you,
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.000]   or LinkedIn or something like that.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.480]   You have this pseudonym,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.060]   and the comments that you see
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.120]   are the ones that are upvoted,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.480]   where humans say, "Yeah, I like that,"
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.840]   or, "No, I don't like that."
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.960]   They downvote it.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   So something that gains the approval of these groups moves up,
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.200]   and in this particular case,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.840]   there is one sub-Reddit called WallStreetBets
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.320]   that found itself at the center of this.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.260]   It found itself at the center of the investing universe,
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.480]   as a matter of fact.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.240]   Stocks that it was talking about,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.600]   GameStop in particular,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.080]   became the most traded stocks in the world,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.460]   and these are not big companies,
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.680]   and they became the most traded stocks in the world.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.200]   So we have the terms,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.880]   we have the companies involved,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.440]   we have some of the people.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.160]   The timing of all of this is important, too,
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.000]   with COVID and stimulus checks and so forth,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.740]   but go ahead and now start the story.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.920]   Ready to go.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.840]   So as you know,
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.160]   I'm an editor at The Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.680]   When something happens in the stock market,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.360]   I tend to see it,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.840]   at least out of the corner of my eye.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.480]   Starting about a year before the story took place,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.560]   I became aware of WallStreetBets,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.320]   and you would see some stock go up 100% in a day,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.880]   and well, let's see what news happened.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.000]   Well, there's no news.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.160]   The news was that they were talking about it
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   on a WallStreetBets,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.320]   and particularly if it was a smaller, less traded stock,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.480]   that surge of interest,
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.200]   where everybody kind of jumped on the bandwagon
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.040]   at the same time,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.160]   for a few hours could send a stock up.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.720]   It was just all seen as a joke at the time,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.480]   at least around where I work,
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.320]   it was seen as a joke.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.880]   I think it was seen as a joke on WallStreet, too.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.080]   Of course, there were probably some people
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.180]   who were trying to ride the coattails
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.640]   who were in the business of managing money,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.160]   but you had to be pretty quick to get ahead of these guys.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.920]   Then the pandemic happened,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.040]   and stimulus checks and the lack of sports
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.800]   and the lack of sports gambling
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.600]   all happened at the same time
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.340]   that supercharged the number of accounts
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.680]   and the activity level of people
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.840]   who were new to investing primarily.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.040]   And those people were getting their advice
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.880]   on WallStreetBets.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.960]   So let's fast forward, though.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.480]   Let's go past all the things that,
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.080]   the ingredients that made this possible.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.200]   It's the morning of January 25th, 2021.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.420]   I have three boys.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.560]   My oldest was a senior in college at the time.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.120]   His return to college was delayed by COVID.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.920]   I was at home editing an article
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.320]   for the next day's WallStreet Journal at home.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   Because of COVID, we're all at home.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.720]   And he comes over and he says,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.120]   "Dad, are you gonna write something about GameStop?"
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.200]   It's like, well, why would I write something about GameStop?
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.500]   I think I'd driven him to GameStop
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.560]   about a billion times in his life.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.200]   I mean, why would I write something about it?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   So I take a look at it.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.160]   GME is the ticker.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.000]   I put it in.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   Oh, it's up.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.680]   It doubled in the last two days.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.360]   I said, "Well, what made you ask about it?"
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   He said, "Well, my friend, Sean, bought it.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.200]   "It looks like WallStreetBets is talking about it,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.280]   "and that's why it's up."
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.100]   I said, "Well, that's great.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.360]   "Well, this usually kind of lasts a day or two.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   "I think it should sell."
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.960]   He said, "No, no, no, he's not going to sell."
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.680]   I said, "Well, what do you mean he's not gonna sell?"
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000]   "He's not going to sell
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.800]   "because these people online are all agreeing not to sell."
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.520]   And it took me about 10 minutes of research
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.480]   to see that something extraordinary was going on.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.640]   We mentioned earlier in the show what short-selling is.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.720]   Well, people on this bulletin board on WallStreetBets
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.920]   had figured out that this was one
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.760]   of the most shorted stocks out there,
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.040]   with good reason, based on how its business was going.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.120]   But there was so much short interest
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.720]   that it was more than the number of shares
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.960]   available to trade, to purchase, which is possible.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.700]   And for that reason, they had devised a scheme,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.600]   and it wasn't even a simple scheme,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.920]   to basically buy the stock, not sell it,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.120]   no matter what, keep on buying.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.960]   And hundreds of thousands of people
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.600]   were joining this forum every day and seeing this message,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.520]   and they were seeing what was happening to GameStop.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.480]   And there was this avalanche of buying
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.920]   by young investors on Robinhood and other brokers,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.740]   but Robinhood was the biggest one that played a role.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.320]   And Rick, if you and I both had investment funds,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.900]   and we were to try to do this,
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.440]   we talked on the phone or whatever,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   and agreed to do this to a third fund,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.720]   the SEC would show up at our door.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.960]   You can't do that.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.720]   Creating a squeeze through collusion is not legal anymore.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.840]   It was in the old days, Vanderbilt and whatever,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.380]   before there was an SEC.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.940]   It's not legal now.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.160]   But what these people were doing was a huge loophole to that
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.840]   because they were doing it way out in the open.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.880]   They had been talking about it,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.640]   just nobody put a suit on every day,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.060]   was reading about this plan.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.000]   You could go back and look at the messages
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.360]   and see that they were very specifically talking about it
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.780]   and really understood what they were doing
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.100]   'cause a few sophisticated people on this board
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.460]   explained to them how to cause this thing to happen.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.740]   And it just built on itself
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.340]   and became huger than they even could imagine.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.580]   They called it bankrupting
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.500]   institutional investors for dummies.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.140]   And it is the craziest thing that I've ever seen.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.300]   And I do tell the story bit by bit in the book.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.140]   I mean, it's not just a crazy story,
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.240]   it's also a lesson in finance and a lesson in economics
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.600]   and it's a lesson in generational attitudes.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.440]   - One of the main characters in the story,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.040]   one of these people on that message board
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.480]   was a fellow by the name of Keith Gill,
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.120]   who goes by the name of Roaring Kitty, plus another name,
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.560]   but I won't use any derogatory names on this show.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.480]   - That's right.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.240]   - But how does he get involved in all this?
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.720]   - He is the most interesting person here
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.160]   and in a book full of interesting people.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.560]   Keith Gill, 34 years old at the time
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.400]   that the events take place, is of that generation,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.240]   but very, very different from it in many ways.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   He's a charter financial analyst,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.320]   which is a difficult financial certification to get.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.040]   It takes about a thousand hours of study for most people.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.280]   He worked for a financial firm, MassMutual.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   You can track his online presence and his video presence
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.240]   on Reddit and on YouTube,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.640]   way back to the beginning of this story.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   At the beginning, he was kind of ignored and ridiculed even,
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.760]   so he decided that GameStop was worth a lot more
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   than it was, and he made some pretty good arguments.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.920]   He is financially sophisticated,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.880]   and there's a value investor that makes an argument
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.360]   that says, "I think this stock is gonna go up."
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.680]   They're never sure, right?
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.080]   And he wasn't sure, but he had a pretty good feeling
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.440]   that the stock that he was buying for four or five dollars
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.480]   was worth more like 10,
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.200]   and he was making an argument to anybody who would listen.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.880]   And Michael Burry, the famous value investor,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.320]   saw it at almost the same time as him and jumped in.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.000]   Michael Burry, he became famous
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.520]   through Michael Lewis's "The Big Short,"
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.840]   another fantastic book,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.320]   which tells the story of a handful of people
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.840]   who made a bundle by betting
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   that the housing bust would happen
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.920]   and that mortgages would implode.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.280]   And so, yeah, he's a very, very smart guy.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.000]   And so the first message that we see,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.360]   the first public mention,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.560]   the first public appearance of Keith Gill
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.840]   is being upset that Michael Burry had bought into it
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.560]   because he was buying these call options in the stock,
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.160]   very long-dated call options
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.000]   that would pay off a couple of years in the future.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.800]   And Michael Burry had shown up
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.400]   and publicly said he was buying the stock
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.640]   and that it made the stock go way up.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.880]   It doubled the value of the account of this guy, Keith Gill.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.280]   Well, if you're a guy on Wall Street Bets
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.400]   and you just doubled your money in a couple of months,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.240]   what do you do?
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.840]   You're like, "Hey, I doubled my money.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.960]   "I'm gonna sell this and move on to the next thing."
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.960]   And Keith Gill did the opposite.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.840]   And people were making fun of him.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.720]   Like, "What's wrong with you?
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   "Remind me when you lose all your money."
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.080]   You know, and he had bought call options
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.240]   that could lose all their value.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   So he could have wound up with zero.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.000]   - And he called this, by the way, YOLO, an acronym.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.400]   - Yeah, and YOLO stands for You Only Live Once.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.560]   It's really a rallying cry
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.200]   of this new generation of investors.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.000]   Like, "Let's take a huge, huge risk."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.760]   And he was taking a huge risk 'cause he's not a rich guy.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.360]   And he'd gone from having 50-something thousand dollars
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.080]   to 100-something thousand dollars.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.920]   So he had more than doubled his money.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   And people were like, "You idiot.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.880]   "Why aren't you selling?"
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.640]   And he said, "No, no, no, that's not how you do it."
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.400]   And he was writing like some behavioral finance professor.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.760]   And these guys just did not,
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.800]   he was just pilloried for the most part
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.520]   on this bulletin board.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.440]   And he would make videos later
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.240]   and then maybe 12 people would watch the video.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.760]   And he'd talk about Benjamin Graham and stuff like that.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.520]   Like it was, his references
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.120]   were going over everybody's head.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.480]   He was just a guy who was pushing the stock
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.840]   for a long, long time
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   until other people discovered him,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.360]   discovered that the stock was prone to a short squeeze.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.440]   And they did it during a very particular moment in history
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.080]   when all the ingredients came together in a perfect storm.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.000]   And he went from being this sort of this,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.880]   seen as this fuddy-duddy to being a hero.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.720]   And nobody knew his name.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.280]   Nobody knew who was Keith Gill or who he was.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.920]   They just knew him by this obscene name
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.200]   that he used on the bulletin board
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.680]   and by the roaring kiddie name that he used on YouTube.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.640]   And there's no connection to his expertise
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.200]   or who he actually was.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.560]   He was just a guy.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.760]   And he changed his message too,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.360]   from being cerebral to posting memes,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.000]   posting all kinds of changed movie posters.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.240]   He was really kind of hip and cool.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.520]   And after a while,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.400]   all he did was just post a screenshot of his E-Trade account
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.280]   which every time he posted it,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.720]   he still hadn't sold.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.600]   And he went from having 50 grand to 100 grand
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.200]   to a million to 2 million to 3 million,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.360]   back to a million.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.400]   So he'd lose a couple of million dollars
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.320]   and he just stood pat.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.480]   And people couldn't believe it.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.520]   They couldn't believe how gutsy he was.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.840]   And by the time our story ends,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.440]   at one point he had in excess of 50 million dollars
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.640]   in this account.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.480]   Life-changing money.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.840]   A thousand times what he started with.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.520]   And he was just a hero just for holding on.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.560]   And those posts, by the way,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.120]   had an important psychological effect too
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.760]   because it's called social proof.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.640]   You want to follow somebody who's made a lot of money.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.440]   They must know what they're doing.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.960]   And so also during this period of time,
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.400]   as you mentioned, sports betting went down the tubes.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.160]   The March Madness was canceled in March.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.320]   Same time, stimulus checks started coming out.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.200]   I think there were three rounds of stimulus checks.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.160]   One of them came out for $1,200 in April of 2000.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.520]   And then there was another 600 in December of 2000.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.480]   And then in March, when March Madness was canceled,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.240]   there was a distribution of another 1,400.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.600]   And that caused some people to,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.440]   some young people to do some kind of wild and crazy things.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.400]   Talk about John Modder.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.960]   Who is John Modder?
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.920]   So John Modder is somebody who I introduced in my book.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.520]   He was interviewed during the peak of this squeeze
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.360]   because some reporters from the Los Angeles Times went out
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.880]   and they were looking for real people,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.200]   not just people with a screen name, who were doing this.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.560]   And this guy, John Modder, is pretty interesting
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.480]   'cause just the way that he talks about it,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   he represents a certain not very small subset of this group.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.120]   He said that he bought the stock,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.400]   he didn't have a lot of money,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.560]   and he didn't care if he lost at all.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.200]   So he said he would buy magic beans for a man on the street
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.600]   if they could be used to bankrupt some hedge fund billionaire.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.960]   That was the goal.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.160]   So this is a group where,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.480]   and especially the people who were late to this,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.920]   not early to this, but late to this.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.080]   So he bought in that week, not weeks or months earlier,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   who wanted to use GameStop and the other stocks as a weapon,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.200]   to weaponize it, to harm Wall Street,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   to hurt these hedge funds.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.760]   And it sounds strange, but you have to understand,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   I do have kids in this age group, what's their experience?
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.600]   I did not lose my house when the financial crisis happened
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   or my job, but a lot of people did.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.260]   And my kids don't have burdensome student loans,
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.920]   but a lot of young people do,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.520]   and they struggle to pay them back,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.760]   and they see Wall Street as a bad place full of bad people.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   And so, hey, here's a chance to hurt
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.000]   some rich guys on Wall Street.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.880]   You know, what's a hedge fund or whatever,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.800]   like, what they fail to understand
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.320]   is Wall Street's a very big place,
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   and Wall Street will gladly accept their business,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.320]   including John Mater's business,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.600]   for however many shares he bought of GameStop,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.240]   and say thank you very much.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.040]   So he exemplifies this group that,
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.000]   it's like any movement, religion or political movement,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.280]   the people who join it on the late side
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.440]   are the most enthusiastic.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.920]   They're real believers in the mission.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.600]   And so this went from a way to make money
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.920]   to a way to hurt Wall Street.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.360]   And for a lot of people, that's what it was.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.680]   And that's when it moved into the political realm.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.760]   As we move along here, the stock is going up.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.040]   More people are jumping on.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.480]   More people like John Mater are opening up
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.160]   millions of Robinhood accounts
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.400]   with a little bit of money, 1,000 bucks,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.840]   and then they're able to borrow money
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.360]   and buy a little bit more stock.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.640]   So you've got this huge influx of new investors,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.120]   very unsophisticated investors
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.720]   who are just buying just to buy
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.840]   because everybody else is buying
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.760]   and maybe it's their opportunity to either make money
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.960]   or to punish those who they think should be punished,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   whatever the reason is.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.840]   At the same time, the shorts are getting squeezed.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.880]   And so they have to buy.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.080]   And at the same time, you've got people like Keith Gill,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.120]   Roaring Kitty, who is out there buying options.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.360]   And when you buy options, as you described earlier,
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.560]   the option seller, the people who are selling you
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.360]   the right to buy it from them at a higher price
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.240]   have to hedge themselves.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.160]   So they're buying stock.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.280]   So everybody's buying stock,
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.960]   but there's only so much stock outstanding.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.800]   That's right.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   That's right.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.480]   There's only so much stock.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.520]   And so when you have a short squeeze,
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.760]   which also turned into a, it's called a gamma squeeze
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.640]   when you affect it through the options market,
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.080]   then their buying goes crazy.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.640]   Now, Keith Gill, just for the record,
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.400]   he had bought his options long before.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.640]   He was not buying more during this time.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.000]   It would hardly have mattered
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.920]   because there was just so much buying going on.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.320]   But he was the hero, he was the exemplar,
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.520]   and he had bought options.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.240]   And so a lot of people bought options.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.880]   And options are like,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.200]   Warren Buffett called them weapons of mass destruction,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.360]   just tongue in cheek,
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.280]   but they really kind of were weapons of mass destruction
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.840]   in this case, because it's like a suitcase bomb.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.080]   You could take something very, very small,
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.400]   a small amount of money in this case,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.160]   and you could have a really outsized, huge impact
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.360]   if you wanted to just use it as a weapon.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.680]   If you bought an option on a stock
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.040]   that was way out of the money,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.440]   so basically had a very small chance of paying off,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.880]   and also that the date that that option would expire
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.640]   was very, very close,
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.120]   then it's like you're buying a lottery ticket.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.920]   But once the stock starts going up,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.440]   the person who sold you that lottery ticket
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.480]   all of a sudden turns around and says,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.280]   oh my God, I need to, my computer says,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.080]   I need to go buy this many shares of the stock.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.520]   And the higher it goes, the more and more shares,
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.320]   every dollar of increase is a greater increase
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.720]   in the number of shares they have to buy
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.440]   to cover themselves.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.360]   And some smart people on the bulletin board knew this,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.520]   and that gave these young people
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.800]   way more bang for the buck.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.640]   - This stock starts kind of creeping up.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.760]   You know, it has its ups and downs,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.920]   but it's going up generally,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.320]   so there's a short squeeze, more people are piling on.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.000]   - It had been going up, and in the fall,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.600]   another person showed up, another young, cool person
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.640]   whose name is Ryan Cohen.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy.com,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.960]   where I am a happy customer of Chewy.com's,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.280]   buy things for my dog.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.560]   It's a pet goods retailer.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.240]   He was no longer associated with it at the time,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.400]   but he had a big pile of money from selling it.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   And he showed up and said, I bought 5% of GameStop,
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.240]   then it was 10%, then it was 12%.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.120]   I want the board to change this.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.200]   And his appearance really set things off further,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   where they saw this guy who had deep pockets,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.280]   who knew a thing or two about e-commerce
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.720]   and about retailing.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.440]   Maybe he actually could come in and turn the company around.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.640]   And first the company was kind of humored him,
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.000]   and then they gave in to him.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   And then he, in January, 2021,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.920]   he put himself and two of his former colleagues
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.240]   on the board of GameStop,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.560]   and caused a bunch of other people to step down.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.360]   That kind of really, really lit the fuse for this.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.280]   That's when the stock really started going up.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.640]   And then you had this very high level of short interest,
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.760]   and the short sellers started to really notice and to panic.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.560]   And there was a real deer in the headlights moment.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.920]   And then one short seller in particular showed up
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.800]   and did not help his cause at all.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.080]   There are some short sellers
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.280]   who are dedicated to the business, but fewer and fewer.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.680]   It's like a sort of last of the Mohicans kind of thing.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.320]   He is one of the last of the Mohicans.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.280]   He is an activist short seller.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.000]   He specializes in finding companies
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.920]   that he thinks are overvalued or perhaps even fraudulent,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.680]   and sells the stock short, and then writes a report,
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.040]   and tells the whole world about it and why he did it.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.120]   And he's done quite well for himself doing this.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   And he miscalculated in this case.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.680]   He went out and he sold GameStop stock short
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.240]   when he saw how much it had gone up,
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.760]   and then went on Twitter and told the people
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.360]   on Wall Street Bets that he understands short interest,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.120]   and they don't, and they're, quote unquote,
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   the suckers at this poker table.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.000]   Well, what do we know about poker?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.720]   Let's say you're a really good poker player,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.200]   and some five drunk tourists
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.440]   with way more money than you show up,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.960]   and start playing poker, and throwing money around,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.240]   and doing unexpected things,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.320]   like playing hands the way that they shouldn't be played.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.720]   You know, you might lose all your money
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.040]   if you really put all your chips into the pot,
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.240]   even though you technically know more than them.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.400]   And that's what happened.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.360]   Basically five million people showed up to this poker game,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.680]   not five, and he got run over.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.320]   But it was like waving a red flag at a bull, what he did.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.400]   He really set them off by saying this.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.680]   And he became public enemy number one.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.640]   First, the public enemy had been
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.440]   a guy named Gabriel Plotkin, who was a hedge fund manager,
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.280]   who was the one person who they knew for sure,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.960]   through some securities filings,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.560]   had heavily sold the stock short.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.480]   And he was like a normal hedge fund manager.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.960]   He also owned stocks mainly.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.600]   But a really successful guy,
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.680]   one of the highest paid people in the financial world, period.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.520]   He'd made over $800 million personally in 2020.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.080]   So he was a real star.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.680]   But then the attention turned to this other guy
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.640]   who was more hateable, I guess.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.760]   And they had already had a couple of run-ins with him
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.320]   on the message board.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.520]   So he became the public enemy,
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.560]   and that's when it went beyond the point of no return,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.040]   where it absolutely went crazy.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.480]   Just for a point of reference, on December 31st, 2020,
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.920]   the stock closes at $1,884
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.280]   and realize it was like trading at $3
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.000]   at the beginning of 2020.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.840]   So it went from like $3 something up to $1,884.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.280]   And now we're starting the year 2021 at $1,884.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   And by a few days, the stock goes up to $65.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   So it basically doubles again within a couple of weeks,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.840]   but then it really starts to take off from there.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.360]   And mind you, nothing had changed for the company.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.160]   The company actually was having a terrible time.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.080]   - They were announcing this too.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.400]   I mean, they were putting their earnings out there
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.240]   and they were not good.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.520]   If revenue was going down,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.440]   earnings were not good.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.960]   Fundamental standpoint, this company was in trouble.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.160]   - Yeah, but Rick, who cares, right?
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.360]   I mean, it's a meme stock.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   So, yeah, and it went to 40 and 50 and 60.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.120]   And that's when the fuse was lit.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.200]   First of all, you had a tremendous upsurge of interest
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.880]   on this message board
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.800]   and a lot of people joining it every day.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.880]   That's when my son's friend got into this, for example.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.160]   He wasn't, you know, he was lurking there.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.840]   My son, a couple of my sons were lurking there too.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.320]   Thank God they weren't buying this stuff.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.800]   And yeah, then it took off.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.040]   Then it went up and up and up almost every single day.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.800]   And from there, the SEC wrote a report on this.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.080]   It's hard to disentangle who's buying made what difference.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.160]   There was a lot of buying.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   - But in the end, the peak price ended up being $483.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.400]   So this stock went from, what did I say?
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.240]   - You said three.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.400]   It was actually, it got down to $2.17 at one point,
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.440]   a year, less than a year before, to $483.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.240]   Same company, not doing any better,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.800]   doing worse as a matter of fact.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.560]   - But on December 31st,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.880]   the stock was trading at a little less than $19.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.720]   - Yep.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.600]   - And within 27 days, no, 28 days, excuse me,
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.400]   it goes from $19 to $483.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.320]   And the fundamentals were getting worse for the company.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.600]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.240]   What happened to the efficient market here, by the way?
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.840]   - Well, the market, it's efficient in the long run,
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.680]   isn't it?
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.360]   I mean, what did Benjamin Graham,
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.320]   and I think it's kind of,
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.680]   Benjamin Graham is quoted, by the way,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.640]   by Roar and Kitty, or paraphrased.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.480]   But it's, you know, the market in the short run
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.320]   is a voting machine.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.680]   In the long run, it's a weighing machine.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.640]   But it was a voting machine during this period, for sure.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.400]   - So all of the short squeeze
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.320]   and these people buying call options
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.880]   and the option writers having to go out
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.720]   and hedge their position and buy stocks
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   and all of these speculators coming in millions at a time
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.880]   with small accounts, just jumping on the bandwagon,
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.480]   the stock gets all the way up to $483.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.880]   And by the way, on that day, 128,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.560]   who is it that does a feature story on who Keith Gill is?
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.280]   It's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.040]   - Yes, that's right, yep.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.080]   Yep, we were the ones who found him, not me.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.800]   A couple of my colleagues,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.640]   they had done the detective work
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.360]   and figured out who he was.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.040]   And they found Keith Gill's mom,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.920]   who's a Wall Street Journal reader, thank goodness.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.760]   And she likes the Wall Street Journal
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.360]   and put them in touch.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.320]   And they interviewed him that day.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   And yeah, it's an incredible story.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.360]   To me, he's a really sympathetic character.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.000]   And so the next morning,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.760]   he was unmasked as Keith Gill from a suburb of Boston.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.120]   - And the stock skyrockets even more,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.880]   but there's a problem that develops with Robin Hood.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.600]   - Yes, that day, there's a problem.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.440]   - All this trading and the stock going up
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.360]   and a lot of people doing it on margin
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.480]   and doing it using options and everything else,
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.200]   it develops and at that point
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.520]   was an unknown problem for Robin Hood.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.880]   And at three o'clock in the morning,
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   somebody gets a phone call, I understand.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.720]   - That's right.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.320]   So when you buy or sell a stock,
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.160]   you say, "I sold $100 worth of the stock
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.680]   "and the $100 is in your account."
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.960]   Well, it's not really in your account
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.360]   because the brokers have a broker too.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.320]   So there's a bunch of plumbing behind the system
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.480]   that has to work.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.720]   And if it doesn't work, then the system fails.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.280]   So it's very important that everybody be liquid
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.520]   in that system.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.280]   And if one broker fails,
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.920]   then every other broker basically has to chip in
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.560]   and cover their shortfall.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.080]   It does happen from time to time,
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.760]   but very rarely these days.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.400]   Your accounts are insured, by the way,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.880]   up to a certain value,
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.080]   but those other brokers still might have to chip in.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.080]   And so basically, the agency that does this
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.880]   and looks at the risk said,
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.680]   "You have all these clients
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.720]   "buying the same handful of stocks,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.200]   "buying, not selling.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.440]   "They all have positions in them.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.880]   "A lot of them have borrowed money.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.480]   "Some of them just opened accounts
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.640]   "and you allowed them to buy the stock
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.880]   "before their checks even cleared.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.800]   "And they bought options and they bought all this stuff.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.120]   "Now, if this stock goes down sharply,"
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.800]   which it did,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.040]   "if it goes down sharply, you could be out of business.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.440]   "You could basically not have the money to pay us."
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.120]   And that would have caused a domino effect on Wall Street,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.200]   just like when long-term capital management failed.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.800]   It was the same thing, only this was with Robinhood.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.640]   That's right.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   And this could be a totally different book
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.560]   if that had happened.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.040]   This would be about like an LTCM or a Lehman-type moment.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.920]   Maybe not as big, but pretty big.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   But can you imagine if this company
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.960]   had never raised a billion dollars in its entire history
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.200]   and they get a call in the middle of the night,
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.640]   3.30 in the morning California time,
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.800]   so 6.30 in the morning,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.560]   three hours before markets open East Coast time,
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.960]   and they said,
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.800]   "Hey, can you please send us $3 billion?"
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.920]   There's no way they could send them $3 billion.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.000]   So they panicked.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.280]   They called in all their bank credit lines
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.840]   and they called their investors and asked for more money,
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.160]   but that was gonna take at least a few hours.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.840]   And they went back to the DTCC, the agency that does this,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.880]   and they said, "Look, what if we don't allow any more buying
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.040]   "of these stocks, this list of stocks
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   "that everyone has been buying?
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.720]   "We're options in those stocks."
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.240]   And DTCC said, "Okay, we'll crunch the numbers again.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.520]   "Okay, it'll be about $700 million
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.000]   "that you need to pony up,"
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.960]   which they could just about do.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.080]   So it was a scary day for them.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.120]   And that's what they did.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.840]   Now, I don't know what I would have done differently.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   Vlad Tenev is the CEO,
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.000]   and he sent out some, not dishonest,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.560]   but not totally forthright messages to his customers
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.760]   about why they couldn't buy the stocks.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.320]   And what wasn't completely clear
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.280]   is that they would be out of business
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.560]   if they didn't do this.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.280]   Later, he spelled it out in great detail.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.600]   He wasn't buying, but he just wasn't being totally open.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.480]   And I guess when there's a kind of a run on the bank,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   in a sense, you don't wanna panic people.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.440]   And so that's what he did.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.080]   But he instantly went from being this Robin Hood hero,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.400]   robbing the rich to serve his poor customers,
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.200]   to having done a terrible thing.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.600]   Basically, to this day,
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.160]   there are conspiracies that hedge funds called him up
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.640]   and told him he had to stop the buying
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.920]   because they were all about to be bankrupted.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.840]   Well, Andrew Lefton and Gabe Plotkin,
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.760]   just for two people who were known in this story,
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.360]   they had been out of the trade for days.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.440]   They took their lumps, they lost a ton of money,
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.200]   and they had skedaddled.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.320]   They were no longer there.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.840]   And it just happened.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.360]   The system couldn't buckle.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.800]   It couldn't deal with all the buying.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.600]   Robin Hood did too good of a job
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.760]   encouraging all this buying.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.560]   And Robin Hood and social media
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.200]   made for a pretty potent combination
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.360]   that the system couldn't handle.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.400]   - Did anybody actually go short the stock on the 20th?
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.040]   Because by the 29th,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.880]   this lost more than three quarters of its value, correct?
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.720]   - Yeah, within a week, it had lost 90% of its value.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.240]   And there were other people shorting the stock.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.280]   We just don't know who they are.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.120]   You don't have to say who you are when you short a stock,
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.920]   just like you don't have to say if you buy a bit of a stock,
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.000]   you don't have to say who you are either.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.360]   And so there were a lot of people out there
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.200]   shorting the stock.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.920]   And I know people who were involved in this
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.560]   on the investor side, the individual investor side.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.840]   And I know people who work on Wall Street.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.560]   I'd send them a note saying,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.160]   "Hey, I have this book coming out."
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.280]   And a surprising number of them were like,
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.400]   "Oh yeah, I saw that.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.440]   "I bought put options that day,
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.880]   "and I made whatever,
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.160]   "hundreds of thousands of dollars personally."
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   So people who were financially sophisticated
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.480]   were aghast and some of them leapt
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.880]   at this kind of once in a lifetime opportunity
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.800]   to make money on the back of these people.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.520]   So rich, already rich people who I know got a lot richer.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.120]   Bill Gross, who's the Bond King, made $10 million.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.160]   He's retired now.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.640]   He's a multi-billionaire.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.320]   And he sent out a memo, a public memo
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.400]   that any of these people could have read
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.120]   explaining why they weren't going to succeed.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.000]   But then for good measure, he just couldn't resist.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.960]   So he sold call options to these retail investors
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.720]   on the open market, and he made $10 million.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.520]   And there are a lot of people like that.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.200]   And that's the story of this whole thing,
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.360]   is that Wall Street did great.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.600]   Wall Street did great in many, many, many ways.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.960]   Citadel did great.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.120]   Robinhood had, after almost going bankrupt,
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.760]   had a pretty good month, right?
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.360]   And so did other brokers.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   So did Goldman Sachs.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.240]   So did Morgan Stanley.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.960]   So did everybody on Wall Street, basically,
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:47.040]   except for a few guys who were big losers.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   And they did it on the backs of these millions
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.840]   of small investors who had a few thousand dollars who were just
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.720]   chasing what they read in the revolution that wasn't,
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.960]   basically, the Reddit Wall Street Bets board.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.800]   In the end, the aftermath, House Financial Services Committee
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.440]   comes in, investigates.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   Did anything come of that?
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   Well, no.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.840]   But the rules that might come out of it
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.280]   might be kind of unhelpful rules.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.920]   So for example, payment for order flow,
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.120]   which is how that makes all this possible.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.800]   You've got to pay for trading somehow.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.160]   There's nothing evil about it.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.400]   It's just how Robinhood exists.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.640]   That came under a lot of scrutiny.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.040]   The SEC might crack down or change some rules about that.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.800]   And the other thing is short selling.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.160]   And the short sellers, they're just the victims here.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.000]   And so they're also likely to face some more stringent rules.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   So as usual, nothing helpful will
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.120]   come out of these congressional hearings
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.200]   and possibly some counterproductive stuff too.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   Let me pivot here to a different topic.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.880]   And that is, what's the moral of the story
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   here for investors?
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.400]   Because you do get into that in the last couple of chapters.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   Yeah, so I think there is a positive takeaway here.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.360]   First of all, I'm not going to get into anyone's politics
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.200]   in terms of whether they don't like Wall Street or want
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.280]   to stick to Wall Street or don't trust Wall Street.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.120]   Fine, none of my business.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.880]   But let's say that that's your attitude.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.360]   And you have this dual goal of making money and sticking it
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.280]   to the man.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.040]   Well, the moral of the story is that all
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:31.240]   of the financial and technological innovations that
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.000]   made this story possible, being able to trade for zero
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.360]   commission, being able to buy funds that cost 0.03% a year
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.320]   in terms of their expense ratio, all those things that
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.080]   have made investing so easy, so cheap, so transparent,
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.600]   all can work to your advantage too.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.080]   All the things that the technologies that
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.800]   armed this group to do what they wanted to do actually
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.000]   armed this group to really do what they want to do.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.440]   Because to make a lot of money and to stick it to Wall Street,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.720]   if you don't like Wall Street taking big, fat fees out
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.600]   of your account, if you don't like them making a lot of money
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.240]   off of you, period, there's a perfect way
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.120]   to do that, which is just to basically buy
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.520]   a handful of index funds, check them infrequently,
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.680]   trade them infrequently, and just kind of be a free rider
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.240]   on this whole system.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.160]   You can be a free rider in so many things in life.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.080]   And you can on Wall Street too.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.200]   That's, I think, the moral of the story
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.840]   is that if you really feel strongly
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.440]   about accomplishing what these young people want to accomplish,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.160]   this is the way, not the way they did it.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.880]   Index funds-- I'm an index fund investor myself,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.000]   and a lot of people listening to the show are index fund
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.840]   investors.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.680]   They actually benefited from this.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.760]   And how?
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.200]   Well, there's an awful lot of money
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.080]   that maybe that wouldn't have come into the stock market
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.240]   from before.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.480]   Now that all these young millions of young people,
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.800]   for the first time, came into the stock market,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.560]   all that money is coming into the stock market.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.480]   And if you own a total stock market index fund,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.160]   you owned GameStop back when it was $3 a share.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.040]   I mean, no more stock was issued.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.160]   So it went up in value in the index fund.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.720]   All these stocks went up in value.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.920]   All these meme stocks went up in value.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.040]   And you actually benefited from that with this money coming in.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.280]   That's really fascinating that all these young people
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:28.880]   lost money.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.440]   But actually, I made money on it too,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.680]   just being an index fund investor on this,
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.760]   because all this now new money is in the market.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.860]   But I also want to make one comment on all of this.
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.280]   I've seen this before, by the way.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:45.520]   This is like a replay, if you will, of eToys, and Enron,
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:50.040]   and things that happened during the late 1990s, early 2000s,
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.400]   during the dot-com boom, where people were just crazy quitting
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.760]   their jobs, buying stocks, didn't even
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.040]   know what the company did, or where it was located,
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.720]   or who the competitor-- it didn't matter.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.600]   The stock is going up.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.760]   That's all they cared about.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.080]   This is like a replay of that.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.640]   But where are those people now?
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.040]   And I'll tell you, because I talk with them all the time.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.320]   They're buying index funds.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.120]   They learned their lesson from this.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.280]   And hopefully, if there's a silver lining in this storm
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.360]   that occurred, it's that these people, these young people who
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.880]   are now-- who got burnt, who lost money.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.320]   And yes, Wall Street made a bunch of money
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.720]   because of what they're trading and what they did,
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.200]   whether it was ultra-realistic, or whether they were just
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.920]   trying to make money, however it was.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.720]   The bottom line is, these young people, I think,
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.560]   hopefully, if they've learned something,
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.120]   they'll become index fund investors
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:48.000]   and long-term investors in investing the way
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.120]   they should be investing.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.160]   So it's a cheap lesson, a very painful lesson,
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.360]   but it's spread across millions of young people.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:59.240]   So my message here is, I'm not so upset that this happened.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.640]   I think it's actually a good learning thing
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.480]   for a lot of people.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.600]   Now, I realize that a lot of people
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.080]   did get burnt pretty badly.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.480]   But how do you feel about that message?
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.240]   Yeah, no, I basically agree with it.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.480]   I give a little bit more of a nuanced answer to it.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.760]   I think that there are people who
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.240]   are going to have a very positive outcome from this,
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.040]   because maybe they weren't interested in investing
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.360]   in finance at all, as many young people aren't,
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.480]   and they don't save enough.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.240]   And that's the root of the retirement crisis,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   starts young, right?
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.400]   When you're young and you don't start putting money away.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.760]   So some of them will have learned kind of a painful,
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.880]   but in the scheme of all the money
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.720]   they'll make and save in their lives,
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.560]   not such an expensive lesson.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.200]   And they'll see the light, and they'll
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.960]   invest more conservatively.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.560]   And in 40 years or whatever, they'll be fat and happy.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.800]   I think that there are a couple other groups that,
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.560]   unfortunately, might be larger.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.000]   The hard core of this group have attempted
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.440]   to make lightning strike a second and third and fourth
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.680]   and fifth time by doing all the things they
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.760]   did the first time around, except now everybody
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.840]   sees them coming.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.960]   These hedge funds, they've written computer programs
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.800]   to monitor these message boards.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.320]   And so they're not going to get caught with their pants down.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.640]   And then there are people who are just
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.760]   going to sort of be bitter and throw on the towel.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.600]   Don't forget, when something traumatic happens to you,
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.960]   you might react the wrong way.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.880]   I mean, you think about people during the Great Depression,
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.920]   for example, that whole generation
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.680]   didn't touch stocks again, ever.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.320]   It took a new generation.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   So if it's traumatic enough, then you're like,
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.760]   the market's crooked, I'm out of it.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.680]   And just say you'd come back and been
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.280]   able to have had a job during the Great Depression
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.600]   and been able to save a bit of money, what a great time
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.720]   that was to invest, right?
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.720]   I mean, if you started investing in 1932,
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.640]   1933, you would have had really, really nice return.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.840]   And you did the wrong thing by just walking away
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.880]   from the market overall.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.200]   And so I'm afraid that that will happen.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.040]   I hope it doesn't.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.500]   It's important to be in the market.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.520]   It's a way to compound wealth.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:08.000]   The stock market's the obvious vehicle to do that.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.920]   Well, it's been great having you on, BogleHeadsOnInvesting.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.040]   The name of the book is "The Revolution That Wasn't--

[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.760]   by Spencer Jacob.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.680]   I wish you a lot of success with the book.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.600]   I highly recommend it.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.600]   It was very entertaining, great book.
