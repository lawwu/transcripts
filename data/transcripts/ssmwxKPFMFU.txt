[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.080]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.380]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.240]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.540]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.100]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.460]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.440]   to the general public.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.240]   Today's episode is going to be all about vision and eyesight,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.260]   a topic that's very near and dear to my heart
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200]   because it's the one that I've been focusing on
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.700]   for well over 25 years of my career.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.480]   When we hear the word vision,
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.820]   we most often think about eyesight
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.320]   or our ability to perceive shapes and objects
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.660]   and faces and colors.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.860]   However, our eyes are responsible for much more than that,
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.600]   including our mood, our level of alertness,
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.180]   and all of that is included in what we call vision.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240]   What is vision?
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.520]   Well, vision starts with the eyes.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.620]   We have no what's called extraocular light perception.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.920]   While it feels good to have light on our skin,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   while it feels good to be outside in the sunlight
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.780]   for most people,
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.180]   the only way that light information
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880]   can get to the cells of your body
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.900]   is through these two little goodies
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.780]   on the front of your face.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.680]   And for those of you listening,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.160]   I'm just pointing to my eyes.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.920]   As many of you have heard me say before
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.120]   on this and other podcasts,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.500]   your eyes, in particular,
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   your neural retinas are part of your central nervous system.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.840]   They are part of your brain.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080]   They're the only part of your brain
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.120]   that sits outside the cranial vault.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.960]   In other words,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.720]   you have two pieces of your brain
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.300]   that deliberately got squeezed out of the skull
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.020]   during development
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.220]   and placed in these things we call eye sockets.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.720]   Now the eyes have a lot of other goodies in them
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.760]   that are very important.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.580]   And those are the goodies
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.180]   that we're going to focus on a lot today.
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.180]   There's a lens to focus light precisely to the retina.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.740]   There are also other pieces of the eye
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.500]   that are designed to keep the eye lubricated.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.160]   You also have these things that we call eyelashes.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.520]   Most people don't know this,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   but eyelashes are there to trigger the blink reflex.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.120]   They aren't just aesthetically nice.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.420]   Eyelashes are there
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.060]   so that if a piece of dust or something
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.040]   starts to head towards the cornea,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860]   the eye blinks very, very fast.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.960]   It's the fastest reflex you own.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.180]   We also have these things called eyelids.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.320]   Now eyelids might seem like the most boring topic of all,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.980]   but they are incredibly fascinating.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.280]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.340]   how you can actually use your visual system
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400]   to increase your levels of alertness
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880]   based on the neural circuits
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.420]   that link your brainstem with your eyelids.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.380]   So let's talk about what the eyes do for vision.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440]   Basically, the entire job of the eyes
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.040]   is to collect light information
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.140]   and send it off to the rest of the brain
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.280]   in a form that the brain can understand.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.020]   Remember, no light actually gets in past those neural retinas.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.520]   It gets to the neural retina
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.000]   and we have specific cells in the eye called photoreceptors.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.800]   They come in two different types, rods and cones.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360]   Cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.700]   and the rods are mainly responsible for vision at night
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.140]   or under low light conditions.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.660]   Generally speaking, these photoreceptors,
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.300]   the rods and cones have chemical reactions inside them
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.160]   that involve things like vitamin A
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.380]   and that chemical reaction converts the light into electricity.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.440]   Within the eye, within the retina,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.560]   there are then a series of stages of processing
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.740]   and that information eventually gets sent into the brain
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.920]   by a very specific class of neurons.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.020]   They're called retinal ganglion cells.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.340]   Now, here's what's incredible.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.160]   I just want you to ponder this for a second.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.480]   This still blows my mind.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.920]   Everything you see around you,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.760]   you're not actually seeing those objects directly.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.120]   What you're doing is you're making a best guess
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.980]   about what's there based on the pattern of electricity
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.500]   that arrives in your brain.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Now, that might just seem totally wild
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.760]   and hard to wrap your head around,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.040]   but think about it this way
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.960]   because this is the way it actually works.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.920]   Let's take an example of a color like green or blue.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.860]   You have cones in your eye that respond best
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.240]   to the wavelength of light that is reflected off,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.460]   say, a green apple.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.360]   So you don't actually see the green apple.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.920]   What you see is the light bouncing off that green apple
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640]   and it goes into your eye
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.720]   and you see it and perceive it as round and green,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.800]   but not because you see anything green.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.760]   No green light arrives in your brain.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.700]   What happens is your brain actually compares
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.180]   the amount of green reflection coming off that apple
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.120]   to the amount of red and blue around it.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.940]   What the brain is receiving is a series of signals,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.960]   electrical signals,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.480]   and it's comparing electrical signals
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.720]   in order to come up with what we call these perceptions.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.940]   Like I see something green,
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.660]   a green apple,
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.340]   or I see red.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.920]   So that's what I'd like you to understand
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.860]   about the way the eye communicates with the brain.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.360]   I would also like you to understand
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.740]   that the brain itself is making these guesses
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.040]   and that those guesses are largely right.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.920]   how do I know that?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.320]   Well, they're right.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.860]   Because when you reach out to grab a glass,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.080]   most of the time you grab the glass and you don't miss,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.100]   right?
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.000]   Most of the time when you make judgments
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.220]   about the world around you
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.020]   based on your visual impression of them,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.940]   it allows you to move functionally through the world.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.540]   So the brain is doing these incredible things.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.940]   It's also creating depth, a sense of depth,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.460]   even though what arrives from the retina
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.580]   is essentially a readout of a two-dimensional flat image.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.960]   Your eyes are slightly offset from one another
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.520]   so that for instance,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.260]   if I look at you,
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.860]   if you're standing right in front of me right now
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.740]   and I were to look at you,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.320]   the image of your face,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.460]   the light bouncing off your face to be more precise,
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.360]   lands on one eye in a slightly different location
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.980]   than it does in the other eye.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.440]   And then the brain does math.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.100]   It basically does the equivalent of geometry
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.240]   and trigonometry
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.980]   and essentially figures out how far away you are from me,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.540]   which is just incredible.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.740]   So the brain does all this very, very fast.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.160]   And the brain uses about 40 to 50%
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.800]   of its total real estate for vision.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.320]   That's how important vision is.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.460]   Now I want to talk about the other aspect of vision,
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.000]   which is the stuff that you don't perceive,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.340]   the subconscious stuff.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.020]   And then we'll transition directly
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.220]   into how you can use light and eyesight
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.540]   to control this other stuff
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.000]   because it's very important.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.260]   And that other stuff is mood, sleep, and appetite.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.380]   And there are ways in which you can use
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.540]   these same protocols that I will describe
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.860]   in order to preserve and even enhance your vision,
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.980]   your ability to see things and consciously perceive them.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.340]   So the protocols we will describe
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.980]   have a lot of carryover to both conscious eyesight
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.920]   and to these subconscious aspects of vision.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.740]   And I just want you to understand a little bit more
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.240]   about the science of seeing of eyesight and vision,
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.180]   and then all the protocols will make perfect sense.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.360]   So as amazing as eyesight is,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.480]   it actually did not evolve for us to see shapes
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.980]   and colors and motion and form.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.160]   The most ancient cells in our eyes,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.700]   and the reason we have eyes,
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.600]   is to communicate information about time of day
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.000]   to the rest of the brain and body.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.960]   Remember, there's no extraocular photoreception.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.780]   There's no way for light information
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.460]   to get to all the cells of your body.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.400]   But every cell in your body needs to know
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.300]   if it's night or day.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.340]   Now, I talked a little bit about this
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.680]   in the episodes on sleep,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.160]   and this episode is not about sleep,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.300]   but I want to emphasize that there is
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.680]   a particular category of retinal ganglion cell.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   Remember the neurons that connect the retina to the brain.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.500]   These are so-called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.300]   named after the opsin that they contain within them.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.520]   They are essentially photoreceptors.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.180]   Remember before I said there are photoreceptors
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.120]   and then these ganglion cells?
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.040]   Well, these melanopsin cells,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.440]   as the name suggests, melanopsin,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.340]   have their own photoreceptor built inside them.
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.900]   These cells, retinal ganglion cells,
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.860]   communicate to areas of the brain
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.160]   when particular qualities of light
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.460]   are present in your environment
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.080]   and signal to the brain,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.860]   therefore, that it's early day or late in the day.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.940]   They regulate when you'll get sleepy,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.980]   when you'll feel awake,
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.900]   how fast your metabolism is,
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.740]   your blood sugar levels,
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.980]   your dopamine levels,
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.560]   and your pain threshold.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.060]   These melanopsin ganglion cells
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.940]   have been shown to set the circadian clock
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.220]   and to respond best
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.660]   to the contrast between blue and yellow light
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.440]   of the light of the sort
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.700]   that lands on these cells
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.040]   when you view the sun
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.960]   when it's at so-called low solar angle,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.140]   when it's low in the sky,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.680]   either in the morning or in the evening.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.060]   What does all this mean?
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.380]   The most central and important aspect
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.320]   of our biology,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.840]   and perhaps our psychology as well,
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.000]   is to anchor ourselves in time,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.160]   to know when we exist.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.820]   We know time at a biological level
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.460]   based on where the sun is.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.600]   What does this mean for a protocol?
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.720]   It means see,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.100]   get that light in your eyes early in the day
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.520]   and anytime you want to be awake.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.240]   So try and get as much sunlight in your eyes
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.520]   during the day as you safely can.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   You need a lot of this light
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.720]   in order to trigger these melanopsin cells,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.960]   which will then trigger your circadian clock,
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.280]   which sits above the roof of your mouth,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.060]   which will signal every cell in your body,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.200]   including temperature rhythms, et cetera.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.740]   So first things first,
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.200]   your visual system was not for seeing faces,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.540]   motion, et cetera.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.480]   The most ancient cells in your eye,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.020]   which are there right now as we speak,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.420]   are there to inform your body and brain
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.420]   about time of day.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.980]   So you want to get that bright light early in the day.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.860]   Absolutely essential.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.660]   Two to 10 minutes.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.100]   Now, here's another reason to do this.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.580]   Getting two hours a day of outdoor time
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.780]   without sunglasses has a significant effect
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.080]   on reducing the probability that you will get myopia.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.120]   Now, myopia or nearsightedness has to do
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.580]   with the way that the lens focuses light onto the retina.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.880]   So remember your eye is an optical device.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.500]   You have lenses in your eyes
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.160]   and those lenses need to move.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.840]   It's not a rigid lens like a glass lens.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.160]   It's a dynamic lens.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.440]   The eye can dynamically adjust where light lands
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.800]   by moving the lens and changing the shape
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.900]   of the lens in your eye
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.820]   through a process called accommodation.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.980]   And if you understand this process of accommodation,
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.860]   you not only can enhance the health of your eyes
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.320]   in the immediate and long-term,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.720]   but you also can work better.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.260]   You'll be able to focus better
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.740]   on physical and mental work.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.120]   You will be able to concentrate for longer.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.360]   So much of our mental focus,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.220]   whether or not it's for cognitive endeavors
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.340]   or physical endeavors,
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.720]   is grounded in where we place our visual focus.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   Okay?
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   What we look at
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.040]   and our ability to hold our concentration there
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.480]   is critically determining how we think.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.920]   Now, accommodation is our ability to accommodate
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.940]   to things that are up close here or further away.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.080]   And the way this works is that the iris
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.520]   and the musculature
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.140]   and a structure called the ciliary body move the lens.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.520]   So when you look far away, okay?
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.900]   When you see things far away,
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.840]   your lens actually relaxes.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.100]   It can flatten out.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.360]   And you'll notice that it actually is relaxing
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.400]   to look at a horizon.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.780]   Whereas if I look at something up close to me,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.360]   like this pen or my phone or a computer screen
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.420]   or this microphone,
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.680]   it takes effort.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.060]   You'll sense the effort.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.420]   Now, some of that effort is actually eye movements
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.260]   because you have muscles that can move your eyes
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.140]   within their sockets.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.280]   But a lot of the work, quote unquote,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.080]   is neural work of the muscles having to move
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.660]   and contract such that the lens actually gets thicker
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.220]   in order to bring the light to the retina
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.780]   and not to a location in front of it or behind it.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.380]   So-called accommodation.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.980]   Now, you might say,
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.420]   why are you telling me about accommodation?
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.900]   Well, these days we're spending a lot of time
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.720]   looking at things,
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.180]   mainly our phones up close and computers up close
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.000]   and we are indoors.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.980]   In other words,
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.160]   you are not giving your lens the opportunity to flatten out
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.200]   and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.220]   but you are also training your eyes
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.040]   to be good at looking at things up close and not far away.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.960]   And as a consequence,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   you are reshaping the neural circuitry in your brain
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.760]   and it is not good.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.600]   You want to get outside,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.120]   not just to lighten the load on your mind
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.340]   or to think about other things,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.680]   but to maintain the health of your visual system.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.340]   In other words,
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.320]   you want to exercise these muscles
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.500]   and that involves both the lens moving
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.160]   and getting kind of thicker
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.040]   and relaxing that lens.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   And the relaxation of the lens
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.980]   is actually one of the best things you can do
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.900]   for the musculature of the inner eye.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.100]   So what's the protocol?
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.340]   You might be surprised,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.840]   but for every 30 minutes of focused work,
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.720]   you probably want to look up every once in a while
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.740]   and just try and relax your face and eye muscles,
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.980]   including your jaw muscles,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.640]   because all these things are closely linked in the brainstem
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.140]   and allow your eyes to go into a so-called panoramic vision
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.800]   where you're just not really focusing on anything
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.500]   and then refocus on your work.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.040]   If you are feeling tired,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.720]   it actually can be beneficial
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.480]   to the wakefulness systems of the brain,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.880]   including the locus coeruleus
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.620]   and these areas that release norepinephrine
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.520]   to actually look up,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.560]   to actually look up toward the ceiling.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.340]   you don't want your chin all the way back,
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.180]   but to look up
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.420]   and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.180]   and to look up
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.420]   and try and hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.720]   It actually triggers
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.140]   some of the areas of the brain
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.460]   that are involved in wakefulness.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.420]   So if you're somebody
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.960]   who's falling asleep at your work,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.720]   this can be very beneficial.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.700]   When things are up,
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.360]   we tend to be alert.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.840]   When everything's focused down,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.500]   including our eyes,
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.200]   it tends to have a more suppressive
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.900]   or sedative type signaling
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.300]   to the deeper centers of the brain.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.480]   How can you improve your vision?
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.740]   How can you get better at seeing things?
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.840]   Well, one way is to make sure
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.640]   that you spend at least 10 minutes a day total,
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.840]   at least,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.140]   viewing things off in the distance.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.040]   So that would be well over half a mile or more.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.520]   Try and see a horizon.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.560]   Try and get your vision out
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   to a location that's beyond
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.640]   the four walls of your house or apartment
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.020]   or the doors of your car
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.080]   and the windshield of your car.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.620]   I know that can be hard to do,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.640]   but it's very valuable.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.500]   So try and see at a distance
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.960]   because it's good for your eyesight.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.580]   It'll keep this lens nice and elastic
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.200]   and the muscles nice and strong
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.000]   that move the lens.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.520]   And it has this relaxing component to it.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.440]   Now, our visual system
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.060]   is exquisitely tuned to motion,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.520]   not just our self-generated motion,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.140]   but the motion of things around us.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.460]   And one of the things that it does
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.580]   is something called smooth pursuit.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.680]   Smooth pursuit is our ability
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.740]   to track individual objects moving,
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.600]   as the name suggests,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.800]   smoothly through space
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.200]   in various trajectories.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.280]   You can actually train
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.600]   or improve your vision
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.380]   by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.420]   And that sounds really boring.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.480]   Remember, the brain follows the eye.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.220]   It follows the movements of the eye.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.820]   it has to deal with that.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.560]   And the neural circuits within the brain
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.500]   have to cope with changes in smooth pursuit.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.520]   So if you're doing a lot of reading up close,
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.640]   you're not viewing horizons,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.100]   you're not getting a lot of smooth pursuit
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.660]   type stimulation from your life,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.180]   or you're just getting it
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.300]   within the confines of a little box on your phone,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.180]   your vision will get worse.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.240]   The idea is that
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.860]   you want to use the visual system regularly
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.020]   for what it was designed for.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.380]   And smooth pursuit is a great way
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.360]   to keep the visual and motion tracking systems
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.420]   of the brain and the eye
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.580]   and the extraocular muscles
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.000]   working in a really nice coordinate fashion.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.180]   So what does this mean?
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.480]   The tool is spend two to three minutes
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.760]   doing smooth pursuit.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.260]   There's some programs on YouTube.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.940]   You can just look up smooth pursuit stimulus,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.840]   practice accommodation for a few minutes,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.000]   maybe every other day.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.900]   just bringing something in close.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.820]   You'll feel the strain of your eyes doing that.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.440]   Move it out.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.720]   You'll feel a relaxation point.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.420]   Move it past that relaxation point
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.300]   where you will have to do
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.440]   what's called a virgin side movement
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.080]   to maintain focus on that location
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.700]   as it moves out.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.720]   Bring it back in.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.580]   Practice that.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.360]   Practice accommodation
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.660]   and then be sure to give your eyes some rest.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.780]   Get outside,
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.640]   look at a horizon or do nothing.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.240]   Just kind of let your eyes go soft.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.280]   I guess what the yogis would call soft gaze.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.980]   Practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.960]   You don't have to be neurotic about this,
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.440]   but if you do this often enough,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.580]   meaning every other day,
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.700]   every third day or so,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.620]   you can be the strange person on the plane
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.860]   or in the classroom doing this.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.620]   You know,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.780]   that people might chuckle
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.740]   or look at you funny or tease you,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.320]   but that's okay
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.120]   because you'll be able to see
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.780]   when they are losing their vision.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.500]   So you'll get the last laugh.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.840]   Let's talk about binocular vision and lazy eye.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.940]   The young brain up until about age seven,
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.140]   but maybe even extending out
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.340]   until about age 12
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.240]   is extremely vulnerable
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.480]   to differences in ocular input
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.460]   between the two eyes.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.640]   My scientific great-grandparents
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.760]   won the Nobel Prize
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.720]   for discovering so-called critical periods,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.580]   periods of time
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.240]   in which the brain is more plastic,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.340]   more able to change.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.660]   Those two guys,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.180]   David Hubel and Torsten Weasel,
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.620]   thank you,
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.280]   David and Torsten,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.760]   forever changed the face
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.620]   of visual neuroscience
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.980]   and forever changed
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.000]   the way we think about
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.680]   treatment of the young brain.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   It used to be thought
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.500]   that you wouldn't want
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.480]   to do a surgery on a young kid
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.380]   because of risk of anesthesia
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.780]   in young individuals,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.960]   but we now know
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.840]   that you need to repair
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.740]   these imbalances
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.820]   that even a few hours
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.240]   of occluding one eye
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.100]   early in life
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.060]   can lead to permanent,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.480]   unless something's done,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.400]   permanent changes
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.500]   in the way that the brain
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.980]   perceives the outside world
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.360]   such that when that eye
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.220]   is opened up again,
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.300]   the brain actually can't make sense
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.280]   of anything that's coming through it.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.100]   It shuts down
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.360]   that visual pathway somehow.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.700]   So what does this all mean
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.460]   in terms of protocols?
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.420]   If you're a young person,
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.100]   do your best
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.180]   to get really good binocular vision,
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.380]   not just at level of your phone
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.020]   or your tablet,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.180]   but also at distance.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.840]   You will build strong binocular
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.520]   visual machinery in the brain
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.260]   and at the level of the eyes
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.160]   and the eye musculature.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.340]   Now, if you're somebody
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.520]   who did have an occlusion,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.800]   what's needed is to cover up
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.320]   the other eye
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.280]   to create an imbalance
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.200]   so that the weak eye,
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.280]   the so-called lazy eye,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.120]   that's sometimes referred to
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.000]   as amblyopia,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.140]   that eye has to work harder.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.900]   Now, you might ask,
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.000]   what happens if you cover
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.400]   both eyes early in life?
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.660]   There are some like retreats
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.380]   and stuff where people go
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.500]   into caves with absolutely
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.120]   no vision.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.040]   It creates hallucinations.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.140]   We'll talk about why that is
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.800]   in just a moment.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.720]   But here's my suggestion.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.400]   Try and get balanced visual input
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.180]   through the two eyes.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.420]   Almost everybody has a dominant eye.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.980]   It usually doesn't relate
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.100]   to your dominant hand,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.780]   although it can.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.220]   And so for me,
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.660]   if I cover up my right eye,
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.480]   I see much less well,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   much more poorly.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.960]   It's a little bit fuzzy
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.200]   and I have to work harder
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.500]   in order to see the camera,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.020]   for instance,
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.980]   than if I cover up my left eye.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.620]   And if you do have strong imbalances
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.540]   between the two eyes,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.900]   which can be caused by cataract
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.940]   and lens issues,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.260]   can be caused by neuromuscular issues,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:55.600]   et cetera,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.180]   to try and get those dealt with
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.400]   as early as possible
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.020]   by contacting a really good ophthalmologist
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.040]   and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.420]   It's very common
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.780]   for young children,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.280]   babies,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.700]   to have an eye
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.980]   with strabismus
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.280]   that either deviates out
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.300]   or that deviates in.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.540]   It is important to correct that
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.700]   if you would like to have
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.880]   balanced vision
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.760]   between the two eyes
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.940]   and for the brain to respond
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.120]   equally to the two eyes
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.660]   and to have,
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.700]   I would say,
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.200]   high-fidelity quality vision.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.120]   Hallucinations are a property
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.060]   of the visual system
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.160]   and it was always thought
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.280]   that hallucinations arise
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.120]   because of over-activation
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.620]   or activation of certain aspects
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.400]   of the visual system.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.720]   I just briefly want to mention
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   a paper that was published
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.400]   by my good friend
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.800]   and phenomenal scientist
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.080]   and physicist for that matter,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.340]   Chris Neal,
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.680]   who's up at the University of Oregon
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.480]   in Eugene.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.500]   They studied LSD-like compounds
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.180]   and discovered
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.880]   that hallucinations actually occur
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.300]   because portions of your brain
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.800]   become underactive.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.140]   The visual portions of your brain
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.380]   hallucinations are under-stimulated.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.140]   This is probably why
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.280]   when people go into these cave retreats,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.260]   something I've never done,
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.700]   I don't think I ever will do,
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.000]   where it's completely black,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.140]   pretty soon,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.520]   they start hallucinating.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.940]   They start seeing things
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.240]   even though there's nothing there.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.520]   The visual system
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.480]   is desperate to make guesses
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.640]   about what's out in the world.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.700]   It's like the eager beaver
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.200]   of your brain.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.420]   It's like,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:17.840]   what's out there?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.280]   What's out there?
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:18.860]   What's out there?
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.240]   So it turns out
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.020]   that hallucinations
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.720]   are an under-activation
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.560]   of the visual system
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.940]   and then a compensatory,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.880]   a compensation
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.380]   by which the visual system
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.140]   creates activity
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.180]   and hallucinations.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180]   So if you're in the dark
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.040]   long enough,
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.980]   you start to hallucinate
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.700]   and see things.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.100]   So that's a little note
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.380]   about hallucinations.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   One of the things
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.380]   that you can do
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.340]   to improve your vision,
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.620]   and it's also kind of fun,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.020]   is to put a Snellen chart
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.820]   in your home.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.320]   A Snellen chart
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.420]   is that list of letters.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.100]   If you go to the dreaded
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.200]   Department of Motor Vehicles,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.640]   have you cover up an eye,
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.080]   read the letters on the chart.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.600]   The letters, of course,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.520]   get smaller and smaller.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.640]   They're trying to figure out
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.860]   roughly what your vision is.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.260]   Cover up the other eye.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.360]   You'll do that.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.180]   This is something
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.180]   that's not often mentioned,
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.060]   but your performance
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.000]   on the Snellen chart
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.800]   will vary depending on time of day
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.980]   because your level of fatigue
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.560]   and your ability
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.800]   to control that accommodation
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.680]   and other mechanisms
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.240]   of the eye muscles will vary.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.340]   So you can take it
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:15.980]   as an average.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.440]   It's also a good thing
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:18.920]   if you're going to get
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.720]   your vision tested
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.460]   for corrective lenses
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.860]   or maybe you're going to do
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.500]   laser surgery
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.380]   or something of that sort.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.600]   If you're thinking about any of that,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.840]   to really get it measured
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.560]   by a professional,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.840]   get your vision tested
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.300]   by somebody
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.780]   who really understands vision,
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.880]   like an ophthalmologist
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.240]   or a really good optometrist.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.820]   If you put a Snellen chart
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.000]   in your home,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.480]   you can do that
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.960]   as part of your visual training.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.080]   Now, this might seem
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.160]   excessively nerdy,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.020]   but what is more important
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.740]   than your eyesight?
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.800]   Eyesight is so vital.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.560]   It's right up there
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.160]   with movement
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.900]   and our ability
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.500]   to move,
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.080]   to generate,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.140]   to get up out of chairs
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.180]   and to walk and to run
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.880]   and to take care of ourselves.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.240]   Eyesight and movement
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.680]   are the main ways
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.540]   that we are able
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.360]   to take care of ourselves
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.480]   and take care of others.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.200]   When you start
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.700]   having compromised eyesight
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.780]   or compromised movement,
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.460]   people need to take care of us
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.100]   and we become
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.440]   much more challenged
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.240]   in moving through
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.980]   our daily life.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.180]   So while it might seem nerdy
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.120]   to have a Snellen chart
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.760]   in your home
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.500]   or to do a smooth pursuit exercise
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.340]   a couple times a week
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.100]   or to get outside
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.940]   for a few hours a day
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:17.560]   and do your reading
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.840]   or your laptop work there,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.600]   preserving your eyesight
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.640]   and preserving your vision
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.980]   is one of the most
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.020]   life-enhancing
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.860]   or quality of life-enhancing
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.780]   things that you can do.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.280]   Now, of course,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.380]   there are genetic factors
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.620]   and there are injury-related factors
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.240]   that can compromise eyesight
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.260]   and our ability to see.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.680]   And of course,
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.180]   the things I'm talking about today
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.900]   aren't going to solve
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.780]   all those issues,
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.940]   but they can have
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.320]   a tremendous positive impact
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.400]   if you're willing to do
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   just a little bit of work.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.300]   So I do want to talk
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.280]   about a few other things
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.780]   that can perhaps improve vision.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.240]   I want to dispel a few myths
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.520]   about stuff to take
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.580]   to improve vision.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.680]   So now you understand a lot
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.040]   about the biology of vision.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.420]   You understand that light
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.480]   has to arrive at the retina
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.160]   and get converted
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.340]   into electrical signals.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.140]   That process requires
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.120]   things like vitamin A,
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.820]   a fat-soluble vitamin.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.880]   It requires things
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.260]   like the carotenoids.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.880]   That metabolic cascade,
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.240]   that biochemical cascade
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.520]   is essential for vision.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.100]   And this is why you've been told
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.680]   that carrots help you see better
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.900]   because they're high in vitamin A.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.980]   There are a few simple things
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.240]   you can do to support your vision.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.500]   First of all,
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.000]   it is true
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.040]   that eating vegetables,
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.480]   the dark leafy vegetables
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.980]   and things like carrots
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   that have vitamin A
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.280]   in abundance
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.700]   and eating them
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.420]   in close to their raw form.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.060]   So naturally occurring foods
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.620]   that contain a lot of vitamin A
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.780]   in their raw form
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.820]   can help support vision.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.120]   Now, does that mean
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.000]   that if you ingest
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.740]   super physiological amounts
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.500]   of that stuff
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.520]   that it's going to make your vision
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.420]   that much better?
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.080]   No,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.440]   but you do need
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.380]   a threshold level
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.520]   of vitamin A
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.620]   in order to see
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.000]   and in order to see well.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Now,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.780]   there's a lot of excitement
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.280]   nowadays
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.680]   about supplementation
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.040]   to help support
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.700]   the health
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.540]   of the visual system.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.820]   But I want to talk
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.880]   about a molecule
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.600]   that's in a lot of supplements
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.440]   to support vision
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.860]   and there are some
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.300]   really good data on
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.340]   and that's lutein.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.060]   What is this lutein stuff?
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.040]   Well, lutein is in the pathway
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.000]   that relates to vitamin A
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.360]   and the formation
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.760]   of the opsin,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.580]   the photopigment
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.940]   that captures light
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.680]   in the back of your eye,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.240]   literally absorbs light,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.720]   pigment in your eye
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.040]   and converts that
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.100]   into electrical signals
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.000]   and allows you to see.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.120]   And there is some evidence.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.520]   I spoke to our chair
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.140]   of ophthalmology.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.740]   There is some evidence
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.460]   through quality
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.440]   peer-reviewed studies
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.000]   that supplementing
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.200]   with lutein
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.740]   can help offset
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.060]   some of the detrimental effects
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.900]   of age-related
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.080]   macular degeneration,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.120]   but,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.400]   I want to emphasize,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.020]   but,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.160]   or emphasize,
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.660]   however,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.580]   only for individuals
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.480]   with moderate
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.780]   to severe
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.900]   macular degeneration.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.000]   For people
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.380]   that have normal vision
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.940]   or with
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.220]   a,
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.820]   just a low degree
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.120]   of macular degeneration,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.200]   these studies
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.020]   did not see
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.620]   a significant
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.500]   improvement of vision
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.800]   from supplementing
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.380]   with lutein.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.600]   And the other one
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   is A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.320]   What is aztex saxton?
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.480]   It's a really
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.420]   interesting compound.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.700]   It's the red-pink pigment
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.460]   found in various seafoods.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.320]   I'm not a big seafood fan,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.500]   but like certain fish,
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.060]   like the,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.580]   you'll see at the fish market,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.220]   will have that red-pink pigment.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.600]   And it's also
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.140]   in the feathers
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.160]   of flamingos.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.900]   It's structurally
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.360]   similar to beta-carotene,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:45.900]   so it's very
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.180]   pro-vitamin A,
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.300]   but it has
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.180]   some chemical differences
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.480]   which may make it
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.740]   safer than vitamin A.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.060]   Remember,
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.520]   vitamin A
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.720]   is a lipid-soluble
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.920]   vitamin,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.220]   so it can be stored
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.720]   in our body
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.300]   for long periods
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.700]   of time.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.260]   What is the deal
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.540]   with this aztexin?
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.440]   You know,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.280]   what are its drawbacks?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.580]   Well,
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.220]   it has a number
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.880]   of different effects,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.100]   but the most notable
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.120]   for sake of this episode
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.680]   is the one
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.140]   on ocular blood flow.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.200]   It does seem
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.920]   to increase
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.340]   the amount
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.320]   of ocular blood flow,
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.360]   so the blood supply
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.000]   to the eyes.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.680]   So that makes it
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.660]   an interesting compound.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.740]   It's also been shown
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.440]   to have positive effects
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.860]   on things like skin elasticity,
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.820]   skin moisture,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.900]   skin quality,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.320]   et cetera,
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.880]   probably due to its effects
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.960]   on blood flow.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.500]   So lutein,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.580]   aztexin,
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.400]   A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.520]   So everything
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.540]   I've talked about today
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.100]   relates to studies
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.740]   that were done
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.460]   and published
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.100]   in quality,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.000]   peer-reviewed journals.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.840]   that doesn't necessarily
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.280]   mean you want
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.940]   to run out
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.460]   and start taking
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:40.880]   the stuff
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.000]   that I've described
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.660]   or even doing
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.140]   the protocols
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.700]   I've described.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.260]   I've given you
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:44.820]   an array,
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.400]   a palette,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:45.980]   a buffet,
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:46.480]   if you will,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.200]   of things
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:47.760]   that you could do
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.840]   to try and enhance
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.820]   or support your vision
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.220]   depending on
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   how good your vision is,
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.860]   your family history
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.520]   of vision
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.180]   and vision loss,
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.860]   your occupational hazards.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.480]   You know,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.780]   people that work
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.160]   with metal filings
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.740]   that are flying
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.460]   out of machines
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.240]   are going to have
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.580]   a higher degree
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.400]   risk to their visual system
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.180]   than will people
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.220]   who just do office work.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.480]   Although,
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.000]   if you're doing
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.920]   a lot of office work,
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.620]   chances are
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.120]   you're not getting
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.540]   a lot of long-view vision.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.980]   Your accommodation mechanisms
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.620]   are going to start
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.620]   to suffer over time.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.680]   I think we can reliably
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.520]   predict that.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.500]   So I've tried to give you
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.960]   an array of behavioral tools
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.320]   and we did touch upon
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.680]   some supplementation tools.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.800]   I'd be remiss
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.480]   if I didn't say
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.120]   that because blood flow
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.980]   is so critical
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.280]   for the neurons of the eye.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:30.500]   Remember,
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.000]   these are the most
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.240]   metabolically active cells
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.340]   in your entire body.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.560]   the cells within your retina
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.720]   because blood flow
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.780]   is required to get them
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.720]   the energy and nutrients
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.200]   they need.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.280]   Having a healthy
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.600]   cardiovascular system,
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.460]   right?
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.520]   Doing endurance work,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.080]   doing strength training work
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.500]   regularly is going to support
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.920]   your eyes and your brain
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.400]   and your vision.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.120]   It's indirect,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   but it's essential,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.660]   right?
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.060]   It's necessary,
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.080]   but it's not going
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.740]   to be sufficient.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.360]   You're going to have
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.220]   to do other things
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.700]   to support your eyesight as well.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.820]   But having a healthy
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.840]   cardiovascular system
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.420]   because it's going
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.860]   to deliver blood
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.120]   and oxygen and nutrients
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.380]   to this incredible
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.120]   apparati on the front
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.720]   of your face,
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.520]   these two pieces of brain
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.140]   is going to support
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.400]   your overall brain health
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.960]   and vision over time.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.180]   Last but not least,
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.000]   I want to thank you
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.460]   for your time
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.280]   and attention today,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:15.860]   your willingness
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.920]   to learn about vision
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.780]   in the visual system
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.680]   and the various things
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.260]   that you can do
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.320]   to help support
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.220]   the health and functioning
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.180]   of your visual system.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.160]   And of course,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.880]   I want to thank you
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.460]   for your interest
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:24.960]   in science.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.120]   Thank you.
