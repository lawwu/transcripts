[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I think everybody needs to plant their flag on the internet
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.880]   and own their domain,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.080]   instead of letting a social media company own you.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   Look, if you write content on Twitter, Facebook, whatever,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.860]   they own you, they have the content,
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.080]   and they're getting rich, right?
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.800]   You are helping them get rich.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.600]   Instead, why don't you get yourself rich
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.700]   by planting your own flag, branding yourself online,
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.880]   and sharing with the world what you stand for.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.620]   The green marble theory is my belief
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.020]   that if you have a janky, crusted green marble,
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.480]   if you put it on eBay, someone will want to buy it.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.160]   And the reason why is because there's something like
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.620]   five, six billion people online now,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.940]   and it's just the law of attraction.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.980]   We're all connected.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.660]   You just have to put yourself out there,
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.900]   and good things will happen
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.780]   if you stay the course long enough period of time.
