[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   The following is a conversation with Brian Armstrong,
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.280]   co-founder and CEO of Coinbase,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.840]   the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.400]   with 98 million users in 100 countries,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.920]   listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.360]   and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.320]   I recorded this conversation with Brian
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920]   before this week's SEC probe
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.480]   into whether some of the crypto listings are securities
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.920]   and thus need to be regulated as such.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.280]   As always with conversations that involve cryptocurrency,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.040]   I try to make it timeless
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.220]   so that the price soaring high or crashing down low
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.520]   doesn't distract from the fundamental technological,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.760]   economic, social, and philosophical ideas
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.760]   underlying this new form of money, energy, and information.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.400]   and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   of how money works and what it can do.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.280]   Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280]   by working together with regulators and governments,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.760]   which is a long and difficult road.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.260]   Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.720]   The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.520]   It is a serious attempt to limit fraud,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.000]   but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.460]   and limiting financial freedom of individuals.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.040]   This is a complicated mess,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.480]   and I applaud everyone involved
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.400]   for trying to work through it.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.120]   I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.080]   Decentralization, after all,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   is a hedge against the corrupting nature
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.340]   of centralized power.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.360]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.520]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.760]   in the description.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Brian Armstrong.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.680]   Let's start with the fact that you're a programmer.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.000]   What was the first program you've ever written,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.960]   or the first one that you remember?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.740]   - The first memory I have of programming
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.340]   was probably in middle school.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.800]   And I remember it was recess,
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.820]   and they had this time period where you could read books,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.240]   and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   And for some reason, I had gotten into this idea
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.580]   that I wanted to get into computers,
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.920]   and I was playing with computers at home.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   And so I got this book, I think from the library,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.540]   and it was called "How to Learn Java in 30 Days."
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.020]   So I was reading this book at the recess,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.700]   and I didn't understand anything.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.980]   And I remember I went home,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.620]   and I tried to get this thing working.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.860]   And if you've ever written a Java program,
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.260]   the first lines are like,
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.900]   "Public static void main string args," or whatever.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.020]   And it's just so foreign,
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.420]   and it's so difficult to get started.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.540]   And so I was kind of frustrated.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.780]   I was like, "I don't understand anything
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.300]   "that's happening in this book."
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.640]   So the first thing I wrote was probably
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.260]   just a Hello World app in Java.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.660]   But I felt like I was so confused
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.860]   about what was actually happening
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.820]   that I later learned a bit of PHP.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.700]   And PHP was more fun for me,
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.420]   'cause it was like, "Oh, just print out what you want."
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.100]   It didn't have all this complexity around it.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.340]   So then I got more into PHP,
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.900]   started building some simple websites,
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.260]   I think learned some HTML.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.180]   So I think that was my introduction to programming,
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.380]   at least the very beginning part.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.420]   - Yeah, Java has a lot of...
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.700]   Out of all the Hello Worlds you can possibly write,
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.220]   Java is the one where I think it's the longest.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.260]   - Yeah.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.140]   - Which is quite interesting,
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.100]   'cause Java is often, at least for a long time,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.220]   was used as the primary programming language
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.860]   to teach people how to program,
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.740]   or at least about object-oriented programming.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.340]   I think most universities have now switched,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.420]   in high school switched to Python.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.860]   I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.700]   - Probably better.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.540]   It's easier to learn.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.260]   It lowers the, it makes it less scary.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.560]   It was like less of a hurdle.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.340]   - And certainly none of them use PHP.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.420]   I love PHP, and I feel like it's a dirty secret
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.020]   I have to keep private to myself,
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.620]   like it's somebody I'm seeing on the side
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.460]   or something like that,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.340]   because it's just not a respected programming language,
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.900]   because I think there's so many ways
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.740]   you can write poor code with PHP,
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.100]   which is why it's not respected.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.980]   - Yeah, it's a scripting language more so,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.300]   although of course Facebook built a huge stack
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.660]   on top of it and valuable company,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.220]   but I still love Ruby to this day.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.320]   Ruby is probably my favorite language.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160]   Python's great too,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.540]   but I just love the idea behind Ruby
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.220]   that it's like, let's make it easier for the human,
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.540]   harder for the computer,
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.620]   and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.940]   So I was never the best computer scientist,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.260]   but I was a good hacker.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260]   I could rapidly prototype products
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.500]   and using languages like Ruby.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.420]   Do a lot of computer science programs
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.260]   still use like Lisp and Scheme and things like that?
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.220]   - No, no.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.100]   They do for, that's like, that's if you're hardcore.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.540]   If you're legit, you're gonna do
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.300]   some of the functional languages.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.920]   I think there's a few others that popped up,
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.580]   but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.980]   That's like somebody that's like,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.620]   you go to library, you dust off the book.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.760]   But Scheme a little bit.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.260]   I think if you're starting,
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.440]   I mean, there's courses about languages themselves,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.580]   like programming languages.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.180]   Lisp might be one of those,
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.460]   you know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore?
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.740]   Like ancient languages?
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.180]   You might have to go to school in that same way
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.660]   for programming languages.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.860]   Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.860]   I, of course, still use Emacs as the editor
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.500]   for most things that I do.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.700]   And Emacs is, you know, a lot of the customization
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.360]   you could do is in Lisp.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.340]   - Yeah. - And that's the language
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.300]   probably when I first really fell in love
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.060]   with programming is Lisp.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.480]   Because for a long time throughout the earlier history
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.860]   of artificial intelligence, Lisp was the primary language.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.540]   But it still had a life in the '90s in the arts
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.220]   where some people would use it.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.660]   - Yeah. - It's such a beautiful,
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.160]   functional language, but it just somehow didn't pick up.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.500]   That said, I should say, sort of push back,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.820]   PHP, I feel like it's still true
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.860]   that most of the web runs on PHP.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.220]   Most of the back end is still PHP.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.740]   So if you look at, you know,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.700]   it's like the stuff that people don't talk about.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.540]   It's like what runs most systems in the world,
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.780]   what runs most back end, what runs most front end?
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.620]   - Yeah. - JavaScript, you know, HTML.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.780]   - JavaScript, I think, the Stack Exchange surveys
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.500]   showed JavaScript's the most popular language
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.420]   in the world, I think, right?
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.260]   - Oh yeah?
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.660]   In terms of programmers and numbers of, I wonder.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.500]   - By survey of number of programmers on Stack,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   Stack Overflow. - Oh yeah.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.440]   But that's also the cutting edge, right?
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.220]   Those are the people that are just like
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.860]   excitedly writing code. - That's true.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.500]   - I wonder if there's people that are just like
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.300]   maintaining gigantic code bases.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.140]   - Yeah.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.540]   I feel like the amount of Java out there
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.700]   just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.780]   And then of course in the banking industry,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.780]   finance, it's like even older stuff, Cobalt and whatnot.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.820]   - I've been actually looking for somebody
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.780]   to interview who represents Cobalt and Fortran,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.460]   like who's the figure still,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.300]   still there that holds the flag.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.580]   I did, you know, with Java, founder of Java,
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.340]   creator of Java, creator of Python, creator of C++,
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   but nobody wants to hold the flag for Cobalt and Fortran,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.900]   even though some of the most important systems in the world
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.060]   still run on those. - Yeah.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.460]   - Like power systems and infrastructure systems,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.700]   which is fascinating.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.060]   Which, and ATMs and stuff like that.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.340]   Like a lot of stuff that we rely on that just works,
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.940]   and the reason we don't change it, 'cause it works well,
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.900]   is written in languages that people don't use anymore.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.140]   - Yeah.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.580]   That'd be a cool series of interviews.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.420]   Get the stuff that's like tech that was invented
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.300]   40, 50 years ago, but still is being used widely.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.100]   I mean, Emacs is an example of that.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.100]   - Let me ask the big question of
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.980]   what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's Coinbase?
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.020]   How does it work?
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.420]   Before, I'll ask even bigger questions,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.780]   but it's just a nice kind of palate cleansing question
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.060]   of what is Coinbase?
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.260]   - Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange,
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.620]   brokerage, custodian.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.180]   Basically, we're the primary financial account
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.460]   for people in the crypto economy,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.300]   how they buy crypto, how they store it,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.180]   how they use it increasingly in different ways.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.340]   We can talk about that.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.860]   So yeah, we wanna be the way that a billion people
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.860]   hopefully access the open financial system globally.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.060]   - How does it work?
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.780]   What's cryptocurrency?
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.460]   There's Bitcoin, there's Ethereum.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.380]   What does it mean to be an exchange?
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.020]   What does it mean to store?
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.260]   What does it mean to transact?
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.660]   What does Coinbase actually do?
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.700]   - Okay, so basically in any given market,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.860]   there's some people who wanna buy,
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.380]   some people who wanna sell,
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.300]   and you keep an order book of all those prices.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.940]   And then if someone's willing to buy
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.820]   for more than the lowest price someone is willing to sell,
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.140]   then you get a trade to execute.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.460]   That's kind of how an exchange works underneath.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.780]   And a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.980]   You don't have to look at the whole order book
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.580]   and everything, but you just go in there and you say,
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.020]   "I wanna buy $100 of Bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency."
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.220]   You get a quote, and if you like it, you can hit accept.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.460]   And the core things that we do to make all that
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.460]   kind of just work, make it seamless,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.060]   it sounds simple on the surface,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.140]   is we have to do payment integrations
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.540]   in a variety of places around the world
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.580]   to make it easy for people to get fiat currency
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.740]   into this ecosystem.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.740]   We have to work on cybersecurity a lot.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.180]   There's lots of hackers out there
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.100]   trying to break into our systems and steal crypto,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.860]   or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.860]   and things like that into these systems.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.500]   We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.380]   which are periodically getting updated
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.300]   and having various airdrops and all kinds of things.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.500]   So we're integrated with lots of different blockchains.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.540]   And then we have to store the crypto
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.060]   that people buy securely as well.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.380]   So crypto is kind of like storing,
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.940]   you store the private keys, essentially.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.020]   And we've invented a lot of cool technology
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.980]   about how to do that securely that helps me sleep at night
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.500]   as one of the largest crypto custodians out there.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.420]   So those are some of the pieces that had to come together
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.340]   to get that early, simple buy-sell experience to work.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.660]   And yeah, I mean, Coinbase actually has
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.020]   a lot of different products now.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.900]   So we have like an institutional product.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.660]   We have Coinbase Commerce, which is like merchant payments,
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.140]   like Stripe for crypto.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.740]   We've got a self-custodial wallet, which we can talk about.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.300]   There's all kinds of cool applications
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.540]   people are building with Web3
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.700]   and they can access it through that.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.000]   We just launched an NFT product.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.620]   I can go on down the list.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.660]   So we're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.020]   We're big enough where we can do multiple things.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.900]   But yeah, the core thing we got started with,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.500]   and still the majority of our revenue today,
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.660]   is people just want to come in and buy and sell some crypto.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.500]   And we help them do that and make it simple and easy to use.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.860]   - I'll ask you about wallet, NFTs, about,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.380]   what is it called, the Stripe type?
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.660]   - Oh yeah, Coinbase Commerce.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.020]   - Coinbase Commerce.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.100]   I'll ask you about all that.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.260]   But order books and exchange,
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.820]   what's the difference between that and stocks, for example,
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.460]   which there's also order books?
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.540]   - Yeah, so I mean, stocks trade through order books too.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.540]   So do commodities.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.940]   - There's all similar type of situation.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.100]   So when I want to buy one Bitcoin
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.660]   and I see Coinbase say the price of that Bitcoin
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.700]   is say $40,000,
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.540]   and I press buy, what happens?
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.620]   - Yeah, okay, so you've gotten a lot,
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.940]   like, you know, when you press the button on your keyboard,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.340]   like an electrical signal goes up the wire on your keyboard.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.980]   No, we won't get on the level.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.700]   - Well, that's also important, the timing, right?
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.780]   'Cause isn't that price fixed?
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.620]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.740]   It's giving you a quote, right?
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.500]   That's, you know, there's a whole concept of like slippage.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.340]   And like, by the time the quote is executed,
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.620]   if the price has moved too much,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.700]   like we may reject it.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.900]   And you know, there's various things like that.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.740]   But how do, I mean,
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.980]   what's the simple version I can give you?
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.500]   So we, you know, we'll basically check the order book,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.860]   give you a quote.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.500]   It's good for some period of time
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.420]   or for some amount of slippage.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.180]   And then what's happening is we're initiating a debit
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.020]   to your payment method,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.980]   whether that's a credit card or a bank account,
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.220]   or, you know, you're storing dollars or euros
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.380]   or something on our platform.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.780]   There's various payment methods.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.580]   So we're basically debiting that.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.500]   And then we're crediting you the crypto
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.620]   and we're taking a fee for it too.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.140]   So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.140]   - And then there's some interesting slippage.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.660]   How do you calculate the, how much slippage is allowed?
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.780]   Like, how do you know these things?
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.340]   That, you know, 'cause order books are fascinating.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.020]   The dynamics of that is pretty interesting.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.860]   - Yeah. - From the little
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.700]   I know about it.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.700]   - Yeah, so there's a lot of people like traders
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.100]   who get super into this and like high frequency traders
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.340]   and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.900]   Flash Boys was like an interesting book on this whole thing.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.860]   You want like access to information to the fastest,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.900]   sometimes even putting your, you know,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.980]   your thing in the data center right next to the thing.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.460]   We don't allow that colo stuff
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.500]   'cause we want it to be more democratized.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.260]   But, you know, basically you give a,
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.100]   let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.660]   We want to charge a 1% fee.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.140]   So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.420]   and we'll charge you $101, you know,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.820]   we've presented you the amount of Bitcoin
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.300]   you're gonna get for the $100.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.740]   Now let's say 10 seconds later, you hit accept.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.980]   We go to fill the order.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.380]   So it's gonna be some error bound around that 1% fee, right?
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.500]   And if we think we're actually losing money on the trade,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.540]   I think we'll often reject it.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.940]   - So some part of the fee,
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.980]   the slippage is incorporated into that,
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.980]   averaged over a large number of people.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.660]   I mean, just, it's fascinating.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.540]   'Cause like even just like that little detail
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.260]   probably requires a lot of experimentation.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.940]   - Yeah, and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.460]   because if you get it wrong,
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.980]   there's people who are gonna arbitrage that.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.580]   And we've had people sort of pen test our systems
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.820]   in really creative ways where like,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.260]   they'll just fire, like programmatically with APIs,
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.620]   they'll fire off like a million different quotes
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.260]   and look for one of them that's out of bounds
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.140]   and then actually take that money right there.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.300]   And you know, we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.260]   - So how do you protect against that?
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.340]   How do you protect?
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.820]   So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways,
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.180]   but there's a lot of clever people
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.900]   trying to do clever things to earn,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.580]   not even just to break into the system,
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.260]   but to earn an edge of some kind in the system.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.780]   How do you stay one step ahead?
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.620]   - There's no silver bullet,
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.740]   it's a bunch of lead bullets, right?
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.620]   So it's like, you know, one thing we do is
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.140]   we just have good test suites, right?
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.340]   So you're testing every piece of code that goes out.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.100]   That's like just common, good best practice,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.340]   but it's particularly important in financial services.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.900]   Another thing we do is we hire third-party firms
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.980]   to try to audit this stuff and break in.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.220]   Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.340]   So we basically pay white hat hackers
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.740]   to find this stuff before the black hats do.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   And we've paid out lots of good bug bounties.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.700]   So, you know, try all the above.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.780]   And occasionally you don't get it right
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.340]   and you lose some money and then you fix it
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.300]   and you keep going, so yeah.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.980]   - Let's talk about cybersecurity a little bit more.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.820]   - Yeah.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.500]   - You mentioned using stolen bank accounts.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.340]   - Yeah.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.180]   - So that's another one.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.180]   That's another interesting one.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.460]   How do you protect against that?
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.700]   - Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.100]   So one of the, there's a lot of things people do,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.940]   but one of the things they do is that
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.140]   use machine learning, right?
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.660]   So you look at hundreds--
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.900]   - Protect or to attack?
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.380]   - To protect against it.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.020]   So what you wanna do is kind of build up a labeled data set
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.340]   of all the different people who have turned out
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.700]   to be fraudulent and good actors,
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.220]   and hopefully collect as much data as you can.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.300]   And then you might feed hundreds or thousands
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.420]   of these factors into your machine learning model
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.540]   and it'll come back with a risk score.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.660]   So, you know, an example of like the kinds of factors
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.220]   people create or put in there,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.820]   you know, obviously I don't wanna disclose too many of them
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.700]   'cause it's a cat and mouse game,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.340]   but just kind of, I don't know,
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.260]   relatively well-known stuff might be,
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.860]   you know, you have device fingerprints, right?
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.860]   So like, what kind of device are you on
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.380]   and what fonts do you have installed?
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.300]   A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.220]   they're using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.220]   They're not like, you know, an average person on that device.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.140]   And then you'll see sometimes like,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.620]   one of my favorite metrics we track for this was called
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.100]   like improbable travel velocity.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.460]   So we were tracking people's IPs, right?
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.340]   And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.940]   and then like an hour later,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.140]   they were in London or something.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.580]   And it's like, well, that's very improbable.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.500]   I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.500]   So you gotta be careful with that
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.780]   'cause like there's legitimate people who use VPNs too.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.700]   But if it's not possible for them to have gotten on a plane
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.620]   and gotten there that quickly,
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.260]   then that's usually they're like spoofing a device or IP.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.540]   Sometimes those are interesting factors.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.580]   But yeah, if you feed enough of these in,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.860]   you will, oh, another fun one is like,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.580]   you know, real users will type their credit card
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.700]   like one number at a time.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.260]   Scammers have a list of them
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260]   and they'll just paste in a whole number.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.740]   So you can look at like the number of milliseconds
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.900]   between keystrokes.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.660]   Like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.340]   - And even for travel velocity,
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.740]   you could probably incorporate VPNs too
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.100]   because there's probably a travel velocity
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.420]   for VPN switching too.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.500]   That's human-like.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.340]   Like if you're using legitimately VPN for something else,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.620]   - Yep.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.060]   - That might be, there's like legitimate uses too.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.660]   Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.860]   that I don't know this, probably should.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.660]   But the, I'm not a robot.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.500]   - Capture thing?
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.340]   - Capture thing.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.180]   - Yeah.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.580]   - So that probably works in the same way.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.020]   Like how do you move your mouse maybe?
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.940]   Or how the dynamics of the clicking.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.780]   - Totally.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.660]   - But how does that even work that well then?
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.980]   And why can't it be faked?
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.940]   I need to look into this.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.860]   'Cause it's such a trivial capture.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.740]   It feels like it should be very crackable.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.340]   And yet a lot of high security places use that.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.180]   - Yeah.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.020]   - It's really interesting.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.940]   - It's another cat and mouse game.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.980]   So I think they've, yeah,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.460]   but it's using a lot of similar signals
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.260]   like mouse movements, keystrokes.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.700]   And then obviously all the stuff that comes
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.180]   over the wire with your browser.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.340]   So like what operating system, what fonts, you know,
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.980]   what headers are being sent over.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.940]   And there's actually, there's an old website.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.780]   I can't remember what it's called.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.500]   It was called like Panopticon or something.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.580]   But it basically was like a proof of concept site
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.180]   that they would just show you all the data
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.100]   that was kind of getting sent over with your request.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.860]   And like say that there's only one person
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.460]   in the world who has this exact set of data.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.300]   It's you.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.140]   And so it's almost like a workaround,
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.860]   a clever workaround to track somebody.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.460]   Make, identify a unique person,
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.380]   even if like there wasn't a cookie involved or something.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.180]   - Yeah, this is a fascinating world
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.340]   where you can't see anybody.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.060]   You're in the dark and yet you have a lot of signal
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.260]   and you have to figure out who's a real person, who's not.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.700]   Who's a robot, who's not.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.540]   - Yeah.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.360]   - Let me step back.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.460]   We're gonna jump around all over the place.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.300]   - Great.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.140]   - Let me step back.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.960]   - That's why I like your interviews.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.140]   - I like technical topics.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.260]   - So just let's use Bitcoin as a measure of time.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.980]   You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.460]   - Yeah.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.020]   - And you just mentioned an incredible system
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.800]   with security, with transactions.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.940]   Everything is thought through.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.980]   There's a lot going on.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.060]   But what was version one back in those early days,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.740]   the first prototype of Coinbase?
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.020]   What did that look like?
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.860]   - Yeah.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.060]   - Like what did it take to write it,
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.420]   to think through it and make it work enough
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.600]   to at least make you believe that it's gonna work?
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.080]   - Well, I definitely didn't know if it was gonna work.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.400]   I mean, it was kind of,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.120]   I felt like I was just following my gut.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.000]   So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.080]   I was a software engineer there, project manager.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.680]   I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.280]   And I read the Bitcoin white paper
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.020]   in kind of December of 2010.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.680]   I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.300]   Met lots of interesting people there,
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.760]   like crazy people, anarchists,
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.860]   really brilliant people, all the above.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.220]   And so I started nights and weekends
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.220]   trying to put together a prototype.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.660]   And my initial thought was,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.700]   well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.020]   And Git is a protocol for version control
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.380]   that people made like Gmail and GitHub.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.500]   Most people don't wanna run their own email server
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.860]   or even their own Git server.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.920]   They just wanna use a hosted thing
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.700]   that will do all the security and backups for them.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.260]   So the thought in my head at that time was,
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.620]   Bitcoin's this new protocol.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.620]   There's probably gonna be somebody
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.460]   who makes a hosted service
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.300]   that does all the security and backups for you,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.100]   makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.860]   So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.700]   or something.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.060]   That was my, it was gonna make Gmail
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.020]   for Bitcoin or something.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.860]   And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.060]   Like most of my smart friends who I told about it,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:55.900]   they were like,
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.680]   well, first of all, I don't really get
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.520]   what you're doing at all.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.120]   Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.080]   or something you've gotten involved in.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.040]   But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.120]   told me they thought it was a dumb idea.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.960]   'Cause they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.840]   you're just gonna get hacked.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.800]   Like nobody, why would you do that?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.160]   And so I kinda had this thought like, you know what?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.760]   I'm not gonna go all in
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   and like make a store everyone's Bitcoin.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.680]   That would be too much right now.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.040]   I have a job, I have a day job.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.560]   But let me just make a prototype
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.300]   and I'll tell people this is like a beta thing.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.580]   Like don't put any real money in it
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.100]   and just see if there's interest.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.300]   And if I feel like I'm onto something,
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.860]   maybe I'll go do this as a company.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.000]   'Cause I really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.700]   I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.500]   And I always wanted to like start a company,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.580]   but I wasn't yet.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.020]   I was an employee at a company that was great.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.740]   But so anyway, I had this prototype.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.300]   I was hacking together nights and weekends.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.900]   I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby,
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.260]   which turned out to be maybe a weird decision in hindsight.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.940]   'Cause Ruby wasn't the most performant language.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.660]   We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.100]   But yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.980]   And the thing that I didn't have any users for it,
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.020]   by the way, I applied to Y Combinator.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.700]   'Cause I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.340]   this will like make it feel like a real company.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.100]   And I was trying to find a co-founder
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.100]   at that time unsuccessfully.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.220]   So I was basically just wandering in the desert.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.460]   I had a lot of self doubt about this.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.860]   'Cause I was like, I don't know,
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.220]   all my friends don't think this is kind of dumb.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.380]   And maybe Bitcoin is just gonna get shut down
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.020]   and like this will all be some stupid thing.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.820]   So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   lost in the desert, lots of self doubt.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.200]   Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.580]   kind of wrote me the first check
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.860]   after I went and interviewed and stuff.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.380]   And they wrote me a check for like 150K.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.020]   And that was the first time somebody
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.020]   who I really looked up to kind of said,
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.540]   this is worth pursuing.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.260]   Like maybe you're onto something, maybe you're not,
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.940]   but like, let's at least try it.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.740]   And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.420]   to quit my job and try it.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.740]   And I'll wrap the story here by saying that,
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.860]   like I found the right co-founder after Y Combinator.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.980]   We still didn't have any customers.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.940]   The thing that, I basically launched
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.620]   the hosted Bitcoin wallet.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.100]   There were people signing up.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.300]   I just posted on Reddit and places like that.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   And maybe like a hundred people would sign up
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.980]   and then nobody would come back.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.300]   And so I was like, I just, in Y Combinator,
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   they often tell you like,
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.860]   talk to your customers and improve your product.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.140]   Talk to your customers, improve your product.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.220]   That's all you're supposed to be doing.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.740]   Try to find product market fit.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.820]   So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.540]   and I was like, hey, I worked on this app.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.100]   I saw you signed up. Can I get on the phone with you?
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.420]   I get on the phone with like five of these folks.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.820]   And I was like, you know, why didn't you come back?
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.780]   And the guy was like, well, the app was okay for a beta,
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.580]   but like, I don't have any Bitcoin.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.380]   So I didn't really know what to do with it.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.980]   And I remember this light bulb kind of went off my head.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.020]   I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there,
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.740]   would you have used it?
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.500]   And he was like, yeah, maybe.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.180]   So then I had this, we went about the process.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.340]   My co-founder at that time, we like got,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.940]   basically you had to get like a bank partnership,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.300]   payment rails, you know, an exchange,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.420]   basic exchange functionality,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.620]   all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.340]   And the minute we launched that feature
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.260]   where you could just click buy,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.620]   put in your bank account or credit card,
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.620]   buy it, buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.500]   From that day forward, like the number of users
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.660]   started to go up like this.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.020]   And so we finally had found product market fit
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.180]   after two years of wandering in the desert.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.500]   - So you weren't even thinking about the buy the on-ramps.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.060]   You were thinking it would be just a wallet,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.540]   a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.500]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.140]   This is, I mean, 'cause that's such a pain to do,
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.380]   to have to work with others to convert dollars
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.860]   of any fiat currency into Bitcoin.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.460]   - Yeah. - So did you,
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.700]   I mean, were you overwhelmed
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.420]   by the immensity of the task here,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   or were you just sort of like,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.940]   sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.860]   through this whole thing
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.180]   and just letting the optimism take over here?
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.540]   - You know, I was really looking forward
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.300]   to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.260]   where, you know, I'm very determined, right?
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.780]   And especially when I get like very set on something
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.700]   and I'm just like, you know what?
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.380]   I'm gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.700]   Like no matter what.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.140]   And so I reveled in that.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.220]   I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.140]   and like every startup has these like, you know,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.340]   major setbacks and just like nothing works.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.180]   And so--
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.460]   - So that was a sign that you're doing something right.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.460]   - I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all,
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.220]   but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience of it
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.060]   in a weird way.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.700]   It felt stressful at the time, like, you know,
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.420]   nothing was working and, but I was just,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.180]   I felt like I was on the right path somehow.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.180]   And so I just kept going.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.020]   I don't know.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.900]   - What was the darkest moment that you've gone to
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.660]   in your mind during that time?
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.660]   What were some of the tougher moments?
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.460]   You said self-doubt.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.860]   - Yeah.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.340]   - Have you, yeah.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.700]   Where'd you go?
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.100]   Where'd you go in your mind?
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.900]   (laughing)
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.460]   Is there a moment where you're just like laying there,
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.220]   this is hopeless?
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.500]   - Well, there's a couple moments I'm remembering.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.260]   I mean, so for whatever reason,
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.780]   I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.380]   And I was like, I really want to do something important
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.220]   in the world.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.260]   Like, you know, I could have a good life
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.860]   and like work for some good companies
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.100]   and write some software.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.940]   And I'm, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.340]   That probably would have been healthier, honestly,
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.860]   just to like, as an expected value outcome,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.020]   that's probably a better thing in life.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.260]   But I was like, I was like, man,
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.940]   I really want to do something important
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.140]   and have a bigger impact.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.220]   And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.620]   I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.660]   I remember one of the,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.740]   just for like years working on this stuff.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.940]   I remember one of the darker moments was,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.140]   we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.580]   And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.420]   like all at once.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.660]   And it was, so first of all,
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.860]   you have to remember at this time,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.420]   we were all very sleep deprived,
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.900]   which kind of exacerbates everything.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.460]   If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.300]   and all these like natural disasters,
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.500]   like sleep deprivation is often involved.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.940]   So, 'cause the reason why we were so sleep deprived
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.100]   is not just 'cause we were working so much,
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.580]   but like the site would go offline
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.700]   in the middle of the night and we'd get,
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.180]   I'd get paged, I was like on pager duty.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.980]   So I'd get woken up sometimes like two or three times
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.580]   a night, like have to try to fix something,
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.940]   go back to sleep.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.980]   So in that environment, you can kind of get,
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.020]   you can get discouraged.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.380]   So one bad thing that happened was,
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.660]   we had a bug on the website
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.740]   and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.660]   who were all like pissed at Coinbase
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.340]   'cause like the balances were showing wrong.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.580]   And they were just like, fuck this company, it's over.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.540]   Like, I hate these guys.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.300]   And so that was, I'd never had this feeling
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.260]   of a thousand people mad at me at the same time.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.820]   You know, I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.420]   Like most of the time people don't get mad at me.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.100]   So that was one.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.420]   Another one was that-
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.260]   - Can we pause on that?
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.220]   That's so interesting.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.100]   So you were saying like, here's a dream,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.660]   I'm trying to create something
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.180]   and now forever the reputation of this dream is ruined.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.860]   It will never, it's irrecoverable, it's over.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.220]   That kind of feeling.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.620]   - Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.580]   I didn't know at that time.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.660]   I was like, is this the end?
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.100]   Like everybody, we're so tiny now everybody hates us.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.340]   So is it over?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.180]   - Yeah.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.780]   - Nobody told me this before starting a company
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.580]   that like, a bunch of people will hate you for this,
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.220]   which is like a very counterintuitive thing.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.900]   'Cause you know, most companies I think
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.940]   are doing good things in the world,
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.780]   at least you're trying, right?
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.980]   And so even if someone's like trying,
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.860]   but they're not, they're failing,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.940]   I'm generally rooting for them,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.380]   at least you're trying, right?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.100]   But that's not the case at all.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.180]   And most founders I've known have gone through this too,
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.660]   where they're very surprised
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.180]   at the amount of hate that they get.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.980]   And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.740]   you can build your tolerance to it.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.500]   Like, because you go talk to somebody who's like,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.420]   for you it feels terrible
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.660]   'cause you're at the center of this storm.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.900]   And like, but if you go, then you go talk to like,
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.620]   you know, your family or some other person,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.580]   like, dude, I didn't even hear about that.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.300]   They're just busy in their own life.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.420]   And so they have no idea that you had all this negative
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.500]   press or like whatever it was.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.020]   - Can I once again linger on that?
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.380]   - Yeah.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.500]   - There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up,
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.460]   just as an example, Bill Gates.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.600]   - Yeah.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.540]   - So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.380]   - Yeah.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.220]   - And there's something about him,
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.420]   this is me talking, not you,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.960]   that he seems out of touch about that hate.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.300]   I believe, at least in my understanding,
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.380]   with the resources he has,
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.520]   he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.660]   And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate,
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   conspiracy theories and stuff like that.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.500]   - Right.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.980]   - And it feels like that's the case
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.100]   because he's somehow out of touch with people.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.340]   So I wonder how you stay in touch
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.540]   with the voice of the people
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.820]   without being destroyed by the outrage.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.900]   Is there any wisdom you have to that?
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.140]   (laughing)
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.980]   - I don't know about wisdom,
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.460]   but I've thought about this too,
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.100]   because yeah, you want to always be open to feedback,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.340]   especially from people who have
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.380]   your best interests at heart, right?
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.440]   And you can become isolated from it
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.340]   and just surrounded by yes people.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.500]   And I mean, who knows, maybe like she and Putin
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.200]   and people like that are in situations I have no idea.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.140]   But if you listen to too much of it
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.300]   and you just try to please everyone,
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.500]   you'll never get anything done.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.920]   And I mean, most of the best leaders are people
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.940]   who they can act when they believe
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.780]   that they're doing something net positive
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.560]   for the world and humanity.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.780]   And they actually don't really care
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.640]   if they piss off some portion of the people.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.180]   Almost anything you're gonna do of significance
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.120]   in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.860]   maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don't know.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.740]   So you never want to become so surrounded
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.740]   by people who just work for you and will say yes.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.500]   And then you think like, well, I'm a genius
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.260]   and I'm like, that's how you become a dictator or whatever.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.060]   But you also can't care so much about what people think
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.300]   because then you'll never do anything
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.580]   that's truly authentic to yourself.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.780]   One other thought on that, by the way,
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.120]   I think it's a really good question.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.500]   So I've thought about this a lot,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.580]   like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on Zuck
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.340]   and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.820]   they don't really hate on Elon.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.020]   Well, actually, Elon has a lot of haters too,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.380]   but it's a different thing.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.260]   - This is measured, this is measured.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.220]   I was looking at some surveys.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.540]   So I think Zuck is the most, so loved and hated, right?
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.540]   - Yeah.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.780]   - Zuckerberg is the most both loved and hated.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.380]   He's the most hated.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.300]   And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.660]   I think it's like 40% hate Zuck.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.620]   People asked, and then Elon is in the double digits,
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.220]   but low double digits.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.060]   And so it's interesting.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.100]   You just look at this data, ask yourself why.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.940]   - Right.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.420]   So I ask myself this sometimes too,
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.100]   because I don't claim to know any of these people well,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.100]   but like I've met them briefly.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.780]   And my impression is that they're actually all smart people
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.800]   trying to do good things in the world.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.180]   So there's not too much difference there
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.300]   despite public perception.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.460]   So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.100]   I mean, it's a complicated question.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.260]   Obviously, Zuck and his Facebook got blamed
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.260]   for the whole election thing and all that didn't help.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.140]   Social media has gotten a lot of pressure just from like,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.780]   hey, why aren't you solving all of society's tough problems?
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.620]   It's like, well, they're just one company.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.380]   But one thing I've noticed is that
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.300]   a lot of these people, they have like Asperger's, right?
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.140]   A little bit.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.340]   And sometimes people with Asperger's
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.740]   don't really emote in the same way.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.100]   And so I think it's almost a form of like,
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.100]   bias against their cognitive type or something,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.940]   which is like, that person doesn't emote right.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.280]   I don't trust their intentions.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.380]   And the other thing I've thought about too,
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.840]   is that sometimes I think some leaders,
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.260]   like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates,
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.940]   they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.860]   Like they're basically,
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.940]   they're giving the PR approved answers
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.660]   where Elon just says whatever he thinks to a fault.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.020]   So even if people hate what he says,
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.220]   they're like, at least I believe it's authentic.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.900]   So I've always thought about that too for myself.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.460]   I'm like, how do I,
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.420]   'cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.900]   Like if you just come out and you're like saying
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.220]   whatever's stream of consciousness,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.640]   you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.980]   or like tripping over some regulation that you've,
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.420]   there's all kinds of things about running a public company.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.080]   You can't say certain stuff.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.300]   But if you're too PR approved in your answers,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.220]   nobody trusts you, what you're saying.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.420]   And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.500]   I don't think I have the right answer,
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.780]   but I'm trying to find that balance.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.340]   - And more and more with the internet,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.380]   there's a premium on authenticity, just like you're saying.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.220]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.040]   - People really, really appreciate that.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.940]   So for leaders, it's a challenge to be,
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.600]   how do I make sure I'm authentic,
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.140]   but also don't say stupid shit.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.980]   - Yeah.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:20.940]   - And so that's an interesting thing.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.700]   I've noticed that just having interacted
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.940]   how much you surround yourself with PR folks.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.380]   'Cause the best, I would say,
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.320]   let me just say a nice thing about marketing and PR folks,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.020]   the best marketing folks are extremely good.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.860]   - Yeah.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.660]   - So they understand exactly what great marketing is
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.040]   and great PR, it's authenticity.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.260]   It's showing, revealing the beauty.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.460]   As opposed to PR and marketing out of fear.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.500]   Oh, don't say that, don't say this, don't that.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.100]   Because then you start living in this kind of,
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.460]   that pushes you towards a bubble
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.420]   where you can't express your beautiful quirks
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.260]   and weirdness and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.060]   And also the cool, the beautiful things
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.120]   about what you're doing.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.340]   I find like, especially with tech things,
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.060]   like even like Coinbase, the way to reveal the beauty of it
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.460]   is not only by showing all the things you could do with it,
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.660]   but showing that there's great engineering
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.180]   going on underneath.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.780]   So letting the nerds shine too.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.540]   It doesn't have to be like these kind of commercials
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.500]   where it's like a happy family using Coinbase
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.660]   to send a transaction about flowers for mom
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.660]   or something like that.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.580]   Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.280]   So that's a general just observation I made.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.940]   But you said you were talking about dark moments
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.060]   and that there's people on the internet
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.180]   that were pissed off that the site was down.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.060]   And you said there might be something else.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.860]   - Yeah, so sleep deprived,
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.800]   like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.440]   The balances were fucked up.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.220]   Like people were tweeting the company's over,
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.580]   just give the money back, whatever.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.800]   And then, oh yeah, somebody posted.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.500]   So we had all this, we didn't,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.300]   we had started to get all these customer support inquiries
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.220]   and like we only had like a few people at the company.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.980]   And so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.740]   So people couldn't get ahold of us.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.820]   So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.220]   and they were like,
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.800]   if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.260]   'cause everyone's upset about where their money is.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.020]   So I remember we're in the office,
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.700]   it's like late at night, we've been working like 12 hours,
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.540]   we're all sleep deprived.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.620]   I'm trying to hack and like get this bug fixed.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.660]   And we all need like food at the office.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.020]   And so my phone has been blowing up all day
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.020]   'cause someone posted my phone number on the internet.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.140]   And there's like a guy,
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.960]   there was a guy like trying to deliver food
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.500]   and I needed to answer my phone
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.460]   to like get the food from downstairs.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.020]   So I was like, shit, I gotta just see if that's him.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.980]   So I started answering the call and it's like,
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.820]   is this Brian?
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.540]   I'm like, nope, wrong number, click.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.940]   And I pick up the next call.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.700]   It's like every way when I finished the call,
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.700]   another call is like coming in.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.420]   So I was like, I'm a reporter from Japan,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.060]   like asking about a security.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   Nope, wrong number, click.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.180]   And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs,
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.020]   bring the food up.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.260]   We're all like surviving to like fix this bug.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.020]   I remember there was just basically a point that night
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.700]   where I was like, fuck, I need to just,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.500]   I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.360]   And I just like cried for a little bit.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.060]   I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self-pity,
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.780]   kind of took a nap for about five minutes.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.180]   And I was like, let's fucking solve this.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.380]   And I like, you know, stopped being like a little whatever
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.100]   and like got back up.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.220]   - Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.780]   and the pressure of the site going down
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.100]   and everybody wants the site to be up,
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.740]   just the pressure from people and the number of users
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.420]   is growing and growing and growing.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.780]   So that pressure is just mentally tough.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.620]   - Yeah.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.380]   - What was your source of strength during that time?
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.140]   Like somebody that patted you on the back
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.180]   and said, we got this.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.820]   - Yeah, well, it definitely helped to have a co-founder.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.060]   So, you know, there's like that old saying about,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.780]   it's better to be in a great relationship
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.060]   than to be single, but it's better to be single
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.020]   than to be in a bad relationship.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.300]   So co-founders actually blow up a lot of companies too.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.660]   But when you find the right co-founder,
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.540]   which I was lucky to find with Fred Urshom,
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.500]   that was very important.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.900]   There was definitely moments where, you know,
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.820]   I was like kind of, you know, at the wits end or whatever.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.580]   And he was like, dude, let's rally.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.380]   Like, and he basically carried the team, you know,
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.420]   a couple of times, like in really key moments.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.020]   - What advice would you give to startup founders
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.460]   about this particular stage,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   about surviving it to the five
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.020]   and through the five employee stage where you--
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.980]   - Yeah, well, if you're pre-product market fit,
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.740]   the best advice that I have from that period
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.740]   is action produces information.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.740]   So just like keep doing stuff, you know.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.980]   I remember like Paul Graham--
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.820]   - Good line, it's a good line.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.580]   - Yeah, Paul Graham had this great line like that.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.420]   I think that's his line.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.500]   And he was like, startups are like sharks.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.420]   If they stop swimming, they die.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.260]   You know, so even if you're like not sure what to do,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.380]   like just do anything because when you do it,
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.100]   it'll produce some information.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.580]   Like people liked it, they didn't.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.620]   This was very true for me.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.500]   There was times where I just did something
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.940]   instead of debating it endlessly.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.420]   And like, just try it, you know, like, all right.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.260]   So we shipped it.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.780]   And like, there was a couple of times
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.660]   where like the minute I shipped it,
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.860]   I was like, I know we built this wrong,
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.380]   but now I have an idea of what to do next.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.500]   And it wasn't, I only would have had the idea
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.940]   if we'd actually gone through the exercise
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.900]   of going to build it.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.700]   It's like, my other favorite analogy for this is that
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.980]   you're like at the base of a mountain
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.940]   that's shrouded in fog.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.060]   And you're looking up at the mountain
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.940]   and you're trying to think like,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   okay, how do I get up there?
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.980]   But you can only see like three or four steps ahead
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.540]   'cause the fog is so thick.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.860]   So you have to just take steps into the unknown.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.620]   And when you take three steps,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.900]   another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.500]   You'll have to retrace your steps or whatever,
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.980]   but, or come up to a cliff, you know.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:10.580]   But most people in life don't take the steps
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.140]   into the fog, into the unknown, because it's scary.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.820]   Or they're like, I don't know, what if I fail?
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.620]   Or like, I don't know how that's gonna work.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.460]   Or I might run out of money,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.740]   or I won't be able to get a job after,
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.660]   or I don't know, whatever reason.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.460]   But that is like one of the things that separates,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.140]   I think, entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.820]   is that they have sort of a comfort
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.660]   with this risk tolerance,
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.820]   but it's actually not really risky if you think about it.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.140]   It's not like, you know, at least in most places,
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.740]   like, you know, if you go to a startup and it fails,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.580]   like you're gonna, you're even more valuable
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.140]   to your next employer, right?
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.220]   Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.020]   try it for like two years or three years.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.500]   If it doesn't work, go get another job.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.780]   It's not like you weren't paying yourself a salary
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.620]   during that time.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.500]   So I think people overestimate the risk of doing a startup,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.180]   and they just never, they never start,
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.900]   because it seems crazy.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.100]   And all your friends think it's silly.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.620]   Like that's sort of the default nature
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.620]   of every big startup idea.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.820]   - It's just basic fear.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.900]   It's the same kind of fear that if you see a,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.700]   if you're a guy, see a cute girl at a bar,
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.300]   it's the fear associated with coming up to her,
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.820]   you like her, asking her.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.140]   It's like, what's the actual risk exactly?
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.300]   - Right.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.820]   She'll say, "No thanks, I'm not interested."
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.660]   - No thanks.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.380]   I guess the risk is like,
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.020]   that's going to be mentally difficult
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.680]   to deal with rejection.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.700]   So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.780]   If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them,
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.140]   and you implement them and you realize they're not good,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.380]   that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.880]   But I suppose that's life.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.220]   You're supposed to, you know,
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.540]   perseverance through the failures.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.080]   And then the risk is low.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.100]   So that's, and then the whole time through the fog
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.340]   up the mountain, you're looking for product market fit.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.620]   So you know you have it when the usage of your product
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.420]   keeps growing without any marketing dollars
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.260]   or anything like that.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.700]   It's just like more people keep coming back
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.180]   every week or month.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.020]   So you're kind of keep,
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.400]   you're basically watching your stats.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.860]   Nothing is working.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.380]   You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.380]   And you basically just keep talking to customers,
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.700]   fixing the, improving the product,
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.900]   talk to customers, improve the product,
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.660]   talk to customers, improve the product,
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.120]   you know, and try not to run out of money.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.420]   So it'd be really scrappy.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.540]   And then if you're lucky,
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.780]   you hit some kind of threshold where like,
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.060]   okay, the thing is good enough now,
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.140]   or we hit on some use case
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.340]   and then it'll organically start to grow a bit.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.740]   And then you have a whole different set of problems
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.680]   once you hit product market fit,
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.220]   which is how do we scale this thing?
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.720]   How do we hire people?
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.220]   How do we, you know,
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.740]   hire an executive team or raise more money?
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.740]   And like, so the problems totally change, but yeah.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.080]   - Well, you were there through the whole thing.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.100]   So that's the other question that's fascinating.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.980]   Again, back to the girl at the bar,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.260]   how do you hire people?
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.340]   It's like, how do you find good friends?
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.780]   How do you find good relationships?
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.100]   And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.940]   Engineers, executive, all of it.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.300]   - One thing is I've done a lot of reps
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.240]   on hiring at this point.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.660]   So Coinbase has about 5,000 people,
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:14.380]   probably the first 500 people or something,
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.980]   maybe in that range.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.140]   You know, I interviewed every single one of those,
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.740]   but you have to remember there's probably like,
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.580]   I don't know, on average,
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.140]   maybe 10 people that we went in the process
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.260]   for every one we hired or something.
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.320]   So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees,
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.260]   I had done like 5,000 interviews or something.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.820]   I was like very burned out on interviews.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.380]   I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.500]   in a day or maybe, you know,
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.740]   you've been doing lots of interviews.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.700]   Maybe you wouldn't get burned out,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.460]   but different kind of interviews.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.140]   - Very different, very different.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.980]   - Yeah. - Very different
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.140]   because you're, so first of all,
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.400]   most of your interviews lead to rejection.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.540]   - Yeah.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.740]   - Which is also exhausting.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.460]   - Yeah, and there's a whole part of the interview,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.180]   which is about candidate experience, right?
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.900]   Sometimes you know it's not the right person,
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.060]   but you wanna make sure they have a good experience.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.060]   If you're just exhausted and you're on your sixth interview
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.860]   and you're like, well, thanks for coming in
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.780]   and you wrap and you just,
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.820]   and then like, you're gonna create a detractor
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.660]   or someone who's out there like,
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.700]   fuck that company or Brian was rude to me or whatever.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.100]   So I had to, honestly,
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.540]   I had to work on that a little bit in the early days
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.700]   'cause I was doing so many interviews.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.100]   Like I needed to make sure that when people came in,
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.600]   I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.300]   ask them a couple of like warmup questions.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.060]   Just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:27.940]   Like, did you find it okay?
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.220]   And like, what have you been up to this week?
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.580]   And not just like, you know,
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.500]   like a factory assembly line, like boom, boom, boom.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.860]   Like, yeah.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.820]   - But also there's a moment,
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.020]   'cause I've interviewed a bunch of people
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.220]   for like teams and stuff.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.060]   - Yeah.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.860]   - There's also a moment when you early on know
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.420]   it's not gonna be a good fit.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.260]   - Yeah.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.980]   - And you still have to land that plane
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.860]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.340]   And that could get really, really, really exhausting.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.380]   So yeah, anyway, sorry.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.540]   So.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.260]   - Yeah, so basically we tried all,
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.380]   we've tried so many things over the years
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:55.620]   to make interviews more efficient,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.860]   'cause it's a huge time sink for the team.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.700]   So, you know, we basically,
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.300]   we'll usually get them down to like 25 minutes.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.820]   I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team,
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   let's say, you know, of people who are like contractors
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.220]   or something, not necessarily full-time employees.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.260]   I've seen people actually do 10 minute interviews.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.380]   You can even interview like a thousand people
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.740]   almost like in a week or something.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.900]   I'm not sure if that quite works out,
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.820]   but let me listen to that.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.660]   But you can basically get six done in an hour
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.860]   if you're just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.700]   for whatever purpose.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.460]   But if you're talking about full-time employees,
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.740]   I usually do like 25 minute.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.860]   You know, you're oftentimes like,
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:37.300]   one thing we've done is we'll put like a Google form online.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.540]   And it's like, put some basic hurdles in there.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.100]   Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.220]   of which you can check in a spreadsheet
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.180]   if it was correct or not.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.700]   And like, there was some funny examples
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.540]   in the early days of Coinbase
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.260]   where we put in like brain teasers and stuff,
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.460]   but we don't do that anymore.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.620]   We do like normal interviews, we do references.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.620]   The kinds of things I ask in interviews,
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.780]   you know, it's usually like,
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.340]   I like to think about what do we need this person
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.980]   to accomplish in this role, right?
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.260]   And get really specific about that.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.140]   It's like usually something pretty hard.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.500]   And then I'll ask them a question.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.340]   It's like, tell me about a time you did X
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.540]   and, or tell me about the hardest,
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.380]   the hardest kind of problem you've had to solve in Y.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.340]   And what did you do specifically to overcome it, right?
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.380]   So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.220]   we need to get done.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.820]   But then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.420]   if I'm interviewing for that.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.380]   And so I'm trying to see like,
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.820]   are they concise communicators?
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.420]   Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.180]   Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.700]   if you ask the first question.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.180]   Some people are, you know, they're interrupters,
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.140]   like church of interruption.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.820]   So like they won't stop talking until you interrupt them,
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.740]   which for me, I'm always patient and I wait.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.180]   So that's weird.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.860]   I'm looking to see for humility too.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.340]   Like, you know, I'll tell, I'll ask people,
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.380]   tell me about a time something went really wrong.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.340]   Like you had conflict with someone on a team or,
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.140]   what I'm kind of looking for is,
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.260]   were they part of the solution
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.180]   or are they still holding onto like blame
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.420]   and criticism about that and be like,
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.300]   "Well, I told them it shouldn't do that way,
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.340]   but they didn't listen to me."
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.420]   And, you know, these are all like bad signs.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.900]   So I'm looking for, yeah.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:11.940]   Can they get the job done?
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.580]   Will they work together on a team?
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.740]   Can they communicate effectively?
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.380]   Do they fit into our cultural values?
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.740]   And, you know, those kinds of things.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.540]   - Yeah, I mean, there's, 'cause I've,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.420]   even for help with this podcast here,
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.420]   but also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.380]   And I was always looking for, you said brain teasers,
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.060]   all kinds of simple questions that can,
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.620]   that can reveal a lot of information.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.860]   And it's always been challenging.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.060]   I used to, I still ask this question,
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.820]   but do you think it's better to work hard or work smart?
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:50.300]   And, you know, I had this idea that I've,
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.900]   that I think I've matured about,
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.100]   which is I kind of believe that people who say
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.100]   work smart on that question don't actually work smart.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.860]   So the right textbook answer is better to work smart.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.140]   But the reality is it's people that haven't actually
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.020]   ever done anything that say work smart.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.860]   They're like, they haven't really struggled
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.620]   because my general belief at the time
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.620]   was in order to discover what it means to work smart,
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.060]   to be efficient, you have to work your ass off.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.940]   So you have to really fail a lot.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.460]   And failure feels like hard work.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.380]   And so I was always suspicious of people
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.820]   that would say work smart.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.520]   I would want to interrogate that question.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.620]   But then I also, you know, have learned that there is,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.640]   people that are just exceptionally,
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.340]   exceptionally efficient.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.860]   They really do know what it means to work smart,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.660]   even at a young age.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.500]   And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.340]   You have to dig in deeper.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.980]   But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked with
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.020]   would say work hard, unapologetically.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.580]   And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.220]   Which is, it's just an interesting thing like that.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.940]   And I've always searched for questions of that nature
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.060]   to see, can I get,
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:22.460]   can I get a person to reveal something profound about them
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.600]   in as brief of a question as possible?
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.580]   And I, you know, and then of course,
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.540]   there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.420]   and stuff like that, depending on the role,
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.220]   programming and so on, to see,
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.100]   can they solve a tricky puzzle and do so,
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.980]   like one that doesn't require a lot of effort,
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.980]   but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.780]   Is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal,
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.760]   but is there some questions
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.020]   that you sometimes find yourself leaning on?
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:58.140]   You said like, how did you solve a hard problem
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.380]   in your past and have them talk through it?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.200]   That's one.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.780]   - You know, we started with brain teasers periodically
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.700]   at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.860]   And I think one, it's a tough one,
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.620]   'cause I actually think it does show
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.380]   how somebody kind of performs under pressure,
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.660]   but I don't think it's a super reliable indicator
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.820]   'cause there's some people who are really good
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.140]   in the typical work situation,
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.420]   but that's not a typical work situation
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.600]   where somebody puts you on the spot,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.580]   like in a live interview.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.880]   And sometimes people get nervous
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:30.980]   and they can't think clearly
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.660]   and like they don't have their computer in front of them
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.460]   or whatever they normally use.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:39.180]   So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.980]   of the brain teaser thing.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.940]   There is a whole, yeah,
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.340]   there is a whole question about,
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.900]   like a lot of universities are getting rid of entrance exams.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.260]   So if you're hiring right out of universities,
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.700]   sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.500]   of like, are they in that university?
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.460]   And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet,
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.740]   but I've heard some companies are actually creating
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.620]   their own like for college grads,
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.620]   like their own basically exams,
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.100]   like standardized testing almost to get people in the door
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.980]   because the degree almost like doesn't mean what it used to,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.780]   which is the whole topic, but.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.340]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.540]   'Cause it's fascinating both for that,
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.640]   'cause it's not just about you trying to hire a great team,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.380]   it's also to help them find the right place to work at.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.220]   - Yeah.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.940]   - It's like a two way street.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:32.360]   All right, so once you found the product market fit,
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.160]   how did Coinbase become what it is today?
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.000]   - Ooh, that's a good question.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.040]   - Let me ask an engineering question actually.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.880]   - Yeah.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.520]   - From the Ruby wallet days,
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.400]   what are some of the interesting challenges there?
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.340]   Or are they not engineering?
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:56.520]   Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.120]   Engineering, regulation,
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.480]   financial, hiring, lawyers,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.720]   what was it?
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.600]   - So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.420]   and you gotta build out an actual company.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.480]   So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.200]   for a while and we were hiring in,
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.440]   we had like maybe 25 people or something.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.080]   I remember one of our investors came by one day
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.800]   and he was like, "Brian, how much of your time
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.320]   "are you spending writing code?"
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.280]   And I was like, "Maybe 50% or something."
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.600]   He was like, "How much time are you spending hiring people?"
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.960]   I was like, "Probably 20%."
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.140]   He was like, "I think you need to flip those numbers.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:36.640]   "Like this company is not gonna scale.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.300]   "You're the CEO, you don't need to be writing code every day.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.700]   "You're gonna have to transition that stuff.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.840]   "Like even if people can't,
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.060]   "all that stuff's locked in your head,
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.640]   "so maybe they're not gonna do it as well as you
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.440]   "for the first six months or something.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.280]   "But like, if you don't start to transition it,
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.640]   "you're never gonna build a real company.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.600]   "It's just gonna be, you're gonna be the bottleneck."
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.840]   So, like a lot of founders that took me a while
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.240]   to like really internalize that lesson.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.760]   I'd always heard people say that and,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.880]   but I still was holding on too much to decision-making.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.080]   And I probably still am by the way,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.360]   like even to this day at Coinbase,
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.560]   where we continually have to push down decision-making
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.680]   in the org, like even with 5,000 people,
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.240]   like who are the owners of each of these things?
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.160]   And so the temptation is people to push it up
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.120]   and you become a bottleneck and anyway.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.040]   So yeah, you basically need to make sure
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.160]   you have enough money where you don't die,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.240]   if there's some kind of a downturn
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.960]   or hit break even in profitability.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.680]   We were in a position where we were periodically profitable
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.280]   during up periods, but then crypto would go down
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.600]   and we were unprofitable.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.320]   And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.920]   and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't like die
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.960]   in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.520]   We had to basically professionalize
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.240]   a whole bunch of services that had been
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.720]   just very quickly thrown together by like 20 year olds.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.880]   Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay,
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.400]   how do you get like a really senior experienced
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.440]   cybersecurity person, but not someone who's so senior
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.480]   that they can't get their hands dirty
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.380]   and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.120]   How do you get a finance person to come and do that?
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.080]   Our finances were a mess.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.920]   Like we didn't even really know how much money we had
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.000]   at certain times and stuff.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.880]   I mean, this was, it's embarrassing to say,
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.720]   but it was true.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.680]   Like I remember there was a point where we had raised,
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.040]   I think like our series C or something like that.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.920]   And I think we had our bank accounts.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.800]   I just put like $25 million like in a different bank account
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.960]   that none of this stuff was touched
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.120]   to the actual operation of the business.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.600]   'Cause I was like, you know, our operations were so messy
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.280]   and we needed to hire a new finance person.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.300]   And I was like this, I'd heard horror stories
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.360]   of actually startups where they thought they had X amount
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.040]   of money and then it turned out they had way less.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.160]   And then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.440]   - So you wanted to have some padding
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.900]   to at least like, all right, I can at least count on this
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.400]   to save us if we go to like super negative.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.560]   - Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.000]   but that was like the only thing I could come up with.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.840]   And you know, until we could hire like a real CFO
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.980]   and finance team who like, okay, now we got our arms around
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:52.820]   how much cash we have.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.640]   It sounds silly, but we had such high volume
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.320]   of money coming in and out anyway.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.840]   - What was the ordering of hiring by the way?
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.400]   Like how many engineers was it early on?
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.600]   You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.440]   - Yeah.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.860]   - Like what was the landscape of hiring
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.460]   as you building up this company?
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.240]   Was it engineering focused?
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.080]   - Well, let's see.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.520]   I mean, so the first person we hired was just like,
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.040]   we need to solve customer support.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:20.960]   So we brought someone to do that
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.500]   'cause we were all staying up till midnight every night
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.840]   trying to do customer support.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.400]   And then we got more engineers.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.960]   And then I think maybe the sixth hire
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.540]   or something like that was a recruiter.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.960]   'Cause that turned out to be, you need to build,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   hire the person who can hire more people.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.640]   - Yeah.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.160]   - That turned out to be a great force multiplier.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.800]   And then you're going down the list.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.520]   Eventually you wanna hire some more senior people.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.200]   We needed legal and compliance.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.440]   We needed that really badly 'cause we,
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.320]   it was all kinds of questions
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.400]   about what the legality of it was.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.720]   - Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.960]   like serious adults?
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.520]   'Cause it's such a cutting edge new world.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.100]   - Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than,
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.380]   nobody had three years of experience with it
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.980]   'cause it had only been around a few years.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.820]   - That's right.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.180]   - So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.860]   There's a certain personality type of people
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.420]   who are willing to join early companies
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.500]   because they have no structure.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.100]   You can't really commit to them about,
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.620]   you're gonna have this team or this boss or whatever.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.940]   Like everything's in chaos and flux.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.220]   So it takes, yeah.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.340]   Hiring is one of the hardest things
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.220]   in the early stage for sure.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.620]   You gotta find people crazy enough
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.260]   to join you in this journey.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.180]   - So one of the interesting things about Coinbase,
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.340]   and you've written, we'll talk about it a bit.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.540]   You're very focused on the mission.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.380]   - Yeah.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.980]   - You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.700]   That makes hiring easier,
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.820]   that makes working at Coinbase easier,
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.940]   that makes, I mean, it's similar.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.780]   So Elon has the same thing.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.740]   It's pretty clear.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.460]   It's pretty clear what we're here to do.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.460]   So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.860]   - Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.940]   - And what is economic freedom?
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:01.620]   - Yeah, so economic freedom is this term
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.060]   kind of like GDP that economists use.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.020]   And it's basically a measure
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.320]   of different countries around the world.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.660]   It looks at things like,
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.700]   are there property rights enforced?
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.780]   Is there free trade?
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.520]   Is the currency stable?
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.100]   Can you start companies that you wanna start?
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.340]   And can you join the ones you wanna join?
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.620]   And is there corruption and bribery prevalent
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.700]   or is it relatively free of that?
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.300]   And so there's several different organizations
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.260]   that basically score countries by economic freedom.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.900]   And the really cool thing about economic freedom
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.780]   is that basically it positively correlates
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.380]   with things that we all want in society.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.660]   Like not only higher growth of the economy,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.380]   but also things like higher self-reported happiness
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.820]   of citizens, better treatment of the environment,
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.380]   better income for the poorest 10% of people.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.860]   And it negatively correlates with things
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.780]   we don't want in society,
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.980]   like corruption and bribery and war,
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.500]   even and things like that.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.980]   And so it's this pretty crazy, provocative idea,
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.580]   which is that if you give people good property rights
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.160]   and rule of law and allow them to trade,
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.380]   it basically encourages them to do more good stuff
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.260]   and the whole society benefits.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.340]   Like one of the things, you may have noticed this
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.660]   growing up in various places you did,
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.220]   or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.340]   that went through hyperinflation.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.820]   And there's a certain like pessimism
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.540]   that can creep into countries
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.040]   when they don't have economic freedom,
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.260]   which it's basically like everyone has this
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.780]   bit of this vibe, which is like,
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.620]   don't stick your head up, don't try too hard
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.940]   'cause it could all be gone tomorrow.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.900]   Like the things that really are valuable in life
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.540]   are just family and friends,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.440]   and the past was better than the future will be.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.580]   And so you don't really, people don't try as many,
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.220]   they don't try hard because you're not really sure
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.060]   you can actually keep the upside of your labor
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.820]   if you try hard, so you just don't try as hard.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.700]   Whereas in America, historically,
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.540]   or high economic freedom countries,
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.700]   people basically like they just try more stuff
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.500]   'cause they're like, if I do good for other people,
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.740]   I'll get to keep part of it for myself
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.740]   and I can improve my lot in life and for my children
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.540]   and my community, whatever.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.660]   So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.060]   a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch at the time,
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.300]   I was like, this might be a really powerful piece
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:13.620]   of technology that can inject good financial infrastructure
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.820]   into all these countries around the world
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.900]   that don't have it.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.980]   Basically good economic freedom principles
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.660]   in like property rights and things like that
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.140]   into these countries all over the world,
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.580]   which just, as long as you had a smartphone
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.100]   and now crypto got invented,
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.220]   everybody could have economic freedom.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.940]   And crypto is kind of really well suited
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.820]   for economic freedom 'cause if you want property rights,
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:32.900]   it's basically, crypto is,
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.580]   if you can remember a 12 word phrase
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.020]   or have an app on your phone,
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.620]   you can store as much wealth as you want
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.780]   and it can't be taken away from you.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.980]   You can even, there's like refugees who need to flee
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.660]   and they wanna take their wealth with them
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.240]   and they can't do it often
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.500]   in the traditional financial system.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.740]   And so crypto lets them do that, right?
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.060]   Crypto is inherently global,
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.740]   so it allows free trade and cross-border payments.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.860]   It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.060]   It provides a stable currency to everyone,
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.980]   not only with Bitcoin,
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.100]   which is kind of like this new reserve currency,
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.900]   but also with stable coins, right?
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.220]   Which are new inventions there.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.860]   So yeah, I basically feel like crypto
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.140]   is this secret hiding in plain sight
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.780]   that can create economic freedom
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   for people all over the world
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.980]   and a more fair and free and global economy.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.060]   - Well, so the limit,
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.860]   and by the way, I didn't know about Argentina.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.180]   Why'd you end up in Argentina?
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.960]   - Okay, so I was basically,
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.180]   I was living in Houston, Texas after college
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.220]   where I went to school and I had never studied abroad.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.220]   I kind of like, I don't know,
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.140]   I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.220]   and I was running this other startup
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.900]   that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company,
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.740]   and I could work from anywhere.
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.940]   So my plan was, you know what,
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.260]   I'm just gonna go do like a month
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.100]   in every city around South America,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.260]   just be like, almost like to force myself
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.180]   out of my comfort zone,
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.660]   'cause I had never traveled by myself
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.720]   to a foreign country or whatever,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.340]   and where I didn't really speak the language.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.420]   And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.740]   thinking I'd go all around South America
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.220]   where I had never been there.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.560]   But I basically, once I was set up in Buenos Aires
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.140]   with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff,
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.260]   then I was like, I don't wanna do that all again next month.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.580]   So I just stayed there for most of the time
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.420]   and took some day trips.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.020]   But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:15.860]   in that regard.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.580]   - You got a chance sort of unexpectedly
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.460]   to experience the social effects of hyperinflation,
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.500]   which is interesting.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.340]   But I also, I've never been,
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.100]   but I really, really wanna go as a person
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.220]   who likes tango, as a person who likes
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.940]   the Argentinian national team and soccer.
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.780]   - Yeah.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.340]   - And steak.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.740]   All right.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.220]   And all the other things that Argentina's known for.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.380]   Okay, so economic freedom.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.620]   One of the limits on economic freedom
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.300]   comes from government and government regulations
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.340]   and all those kinds of things throughout the world.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.340]   So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.540]   So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.860]   What are the things that limit economic freedom
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.900]   and how does crypto help ease that?
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.460]   - Today, the world, the traditional financial system
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.300]   is basically every country of the world,
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.260]   for the most part, has their own currency.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.300]   And so there's a group of people or institutions
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.420]   in each of those countries that's controlling
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.620]   that economic policy or that money supply.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.420]   And it can be manipulated, right?
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.140]   So it's not like many of these currencies
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.860]   are not linked to gold standard.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.260]   The US kind of famously came off that in the 1970s,
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.020]   for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff,
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.500]   like he talks about, there's thousands of fiat currencies
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.700]   that have been in existence over time.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.660]   And basically all of them eventually get disconnected
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.700]   from backing of like hard commodities,
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.460]   and then they get over inflated and printed.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.980]   And so in times of stress, with Nixon,
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.620]   I guess it was like in the US,
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.900]   it was the Vietnam War or something like that.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.340]   It kind of drove government spending.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.900]   And so under times of stress, they say,
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.820]   "Hey, it's a temporary measure, we need to break the peg."
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.100]   Temporary was like famous words that he used.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.500]   And they go print.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.300]   And so the bad thing about that, of course,
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.980]   is that it sort of erodes people's wealth
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.580]   if they can only hold their assets in cash,
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:16.460]   which basically like poor people tend to do that.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.220]   If you're wealthy, you can hold stocks
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.740]   or like real estate and things like that.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.700]   But it's really a tax on the poorest people
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.780]   in society, inflation.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.060]   So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit of like
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.620]   a return to the gold standard in this digital era, right?
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.820]   Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it,
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.940]   it's deflationary,
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.420]   there's never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.740]   And so that's a really important principle.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.260]   I also think, not just Bitcoin,
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.060]   but like cryptocurrency generally,
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.940]   it's really important in terms of this,
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.700]   you asked about regulation, right?
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.460]   So think about like,
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.660]   if you wanted to make a global
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:59.100]   borrowing and lending marketplace or a global exchange,
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.780]   you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world,
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.740]   sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.820]   and get lending licenses or an operating exchange
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.020]   or whatever.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.660]   And, you know, they're not gonna,
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.860]   that's just an incredible amount of work
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.860]   and you can't even do business in many of these countries
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.260]   because like, you know, you have to bribe somebody
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.820]   or it's corrupt or whatever.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.260]   And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance,
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.220]   people have published, you know,
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.260]   like Uniswap is a decentralized exchange.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.140]   Everybody in the world,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.100]   no matter what country you're in, what jurisdiction,
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.980]   can interface with that decentralized exchange.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.460]   'Cause it, and there's no central company operating it.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.580]   It's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain,
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.140]   which is globally decentralized.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.220]   So there's no throat to choke.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.620]   There's no one person you can,
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.940]   or a company you can go to, to like,
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.460]   hey, shut this thing down.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.860]   Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped,
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.140]   the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.540]   on the Ethereum blockchain.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:56.340]   Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace,
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.220]   you know, like it's, you know,
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.820]   if you want, somebody in India wants to borrow
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.980]   from somebody in the US or whatever,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.220]   like there's very difficult to do that
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.180]   in the traditional financial world.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.820]   But in a smart contract that's decentralized,
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.620]   you can enable anybody to access it.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.220]   So it's really kind of this great democratizing force
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.260]   that is creating a new financial system
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.900]   that is more fair and more free.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.100]   Yeah, and in some ways it is,
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.220]   it's a clever way that's not,
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.340]   yeah, it's enabling people to do that in a novel way.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.180]   - So is Uniswap in some sense a competitor to Coinbase?
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.660]   In which way is it, in which way is it not?
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.300]   So, because for people who don't know,
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.620]   Coinbase is centralized.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.620]   So let me ask, doesn't that go against the spirit of crypto?
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:49.060]   Since crypto is decentralized,
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.900]   what are the pros and cons of being centralized
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.940]   as an exchange?
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.940]   - So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.300]   We have many different products,
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.060]   and the way that I think about it is that our exchange
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.700]   or our brokerage is a centralized,
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.060]   regulated financial service business.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.100]   And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.460]   to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.340]   in the world to flow into the crypto economy.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.900]   So we, you know, we're very proud of that,
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.580]   and I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.580]   Now, once people have money in crypto,
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.220]   they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways,
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.620]   and they can choose to hold it in a self-custodial wallet,
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.180]   which is more decentralized.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.540]   They can choose to use decentralized exchanges,
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.740]   which we love, and Uniswap is not really,
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.860]   I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.420]   We basically have integrated Uniswap
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.300]   into a number of our products.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.420]   We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:46.260]   So Coinbase wallet, which is a self-custodial wallet,
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.780]   is more decentralized, and it allows people
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.460]   to hold their own crypto.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.460]   They don't have to trust us.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.820]   - Can you explain what a self-custodial wallet is?
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.820]   What is a wallet, and what is a self-custodial wallet?
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.580]   - Yeah, so it's confusing.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.180]   So a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.340]   to store your crypto, the private keys themselves.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.540]   And, you know, for some people in institutions
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.860]   and everything, just meeting them where they are today,
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.940]   that's nice because it's simpler, you know,
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:18.620]   they're not afraid of losing their crypto
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.140]   if they make some accidental mistake.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.060]   So, you know, custodial crypto products are important
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.420]   to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.500]   But I'm very supportive of self-custodial wallets.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.420]   And I think in some ways they are the future
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.540]   because more and more people are gonna wanna store
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.940]   their own crypto, not trust a third-party institution
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.780]   to do it.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.900]   And in some ways that is much more authentic
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.100]   to the ethos of crypto.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.540]   So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.980]   Frankly, that's a more centralized thing.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.700]   But once you have crypto, you can then go
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.100]   to the self-custodial world, store it yourself.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.460]   To get into the technical details, just for a second,
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.460]   it's basically saying you're gonna store the keys
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.860]   on your own device.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.140]   And so even if Coinbase, you know,
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.620]   gets some court order to seize it, we actually can't.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.540]   Like from an architecture point of view, we can't do it.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.460]   Or, you know, if Coinbase gets hacked or something,
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.500]   we can't lose your funds.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   Like now you, the thing is you have to take
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.060]   the responsibility 'cause we're not taking it.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.860]   So the individual person could get hacked, right?
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.940]   And there's a whole bunch of really cool research happening
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.860]   to make self-custodial wallets more resilient
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.780]   to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.900]   Like, you know, I don't know how much you've looked
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.340]   at like various cryptography things,
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   but there's like, basically you can have multiple key,
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.460]   multi-sig, multiple signatures from different keys
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.540]   on different devices where you need like two of the three
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.740]   or three of the five.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.220]   There's a whole technology called multi-party computation
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.460]   or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.060]   - But those are the things you would run locally?
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:49.900]   - Yeah. - Like what,
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.460]   these are all security measures, like cryptography measures
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.620]   to protect you without a centralized component?
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.460]   - Right.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.980]   So like a simple example would be,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.340]   let's say you had a two of three key signature
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.820]   and, you know, one key might be stored at Coinbase,
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.220]   but that's not a quorum.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.180]   So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.780]   But another key is on your device, on your phone, let's say.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.700]   - Oh, cool.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.820]   - So that, so in a normal situation,
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.900]   you have a key on your phone, we have one,
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.700]   but you, and so two out of three, now just, you know,
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.940]   it can all get signed very quickly for day-to-day use.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.980]   But let's say you lose your phone or something.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.420]   Now there has to be a third key,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.660]   and that's where, you know,
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.700]   you could store it in a backup somewhere,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.860]   like in Google Drive or iCloud.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   You could trust a third party that's not Coinbase
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.260]   to also have that one key,
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.180]   and they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.660]   So that's a simple example.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.260]   You can get way more complicated.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.260]   - Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.380]   And so like, if your funds get seized,
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.220]   Coinbase can't do anything.
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.060]   - Right.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.300]   - But you better not lose your phone, maybe, in that case.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.140]   - Yeah.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:53.980]   - So that's, okay.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.700]   - Well, then it, but it provides a, there is,
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.620]   so even if you lose your phone,
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.820]   then there is a recovery mechanism,
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.140]   'cause you can get the one key from Coinbase,
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.460]   the one from your backup provider,
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.860]   and recover a new one back on your phone.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.700]   - I know, yeah.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.820]   But what if Coinbase is no longer,
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.380]   but because of government,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.980]   because of, say it's in North Korea,
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.620]   government says you're no longer,
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.740]   like Coinbase is shut down in that country
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.820]   or something like that.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.740]   Then you can get it, even if you have access to those two.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:19.580]   - Right.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.180]   - So again, perhaps a silly question,
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.780]   but isn't a self-custodial wallet
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.860]   a competitor as a notion to Coinbase?
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.460]   - No, I mean, so we offer a self-custodial wallet.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.620]   We've built one and it's like-
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.460]   - But doesn't it bleed the,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.580]   like, I guess I'm asking a sort of a financial question,
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.940]   is like, how does Coinbase make money on transactions?
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.140]   So does this not, does it does not decrease the number
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.700]   or does not significantly negatively affect transactions?
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.020]   Or are you more focused on growing the number of,
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.820]   the pie of the number of people
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.700]   that are using cryptocurrency?
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.580]   - Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.740]   would probably say, well, we should be storing,
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.740]   let's keep more of the custody with us
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.780]   because that's how we prove to the world
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.540]   that we're valuable or whatever.
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.660]   I don't really believe that.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.020]   Like, I think that actually we kind of want to encourage
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020]   our users to move to self-custody over time
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020]   for those who are ready and willing.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.680]   And that technology needs to mature.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.260]   I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.100]   who doesn't want to do it.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.300]   But to me, that's like the future
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.860]   of how we get billions of people using crypto.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.620]   - But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else?
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:27.460]   Easier?
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.660]   - Yeah, that's sort of the point is like,
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.020]   we're all using the same protocol.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.340]   So there's low switching costs,
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.520]   which keeps all the companies accountable, right?
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.540]   Like, if you want to access the Visa network,
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.620]   there's only one company in the world
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.760]   you can go through to do that, like Visa.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.540]   But if you want to access the Bitcoin network,
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.780]   there's dozens or hundreds of companies out there
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.620]   who can do that.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.980]   So it's, you know, it's arguably,
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:51.340]   you could argue it's worse for us as a company,
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.160]   but I think it's better for,
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.580]   it's what makes Bitcoin interesting
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.040]   and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.980]   There is low switching costs for customers.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.220]   It's better for customers.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.300]   And that means that all the companies in the space
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.540]   are going to be held to a high standard
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.100]   because the minute you lose someone's trust,
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.020]   they're just going to move their Bitcoin
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.540]   to some other service.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.220]   And that's good for the world.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.500]   - Do you think of Coinbase as,
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.940]   so there's these ideas of layer one, layer two,
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.460]   layer three technologies.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.300]   - Yeah.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.060]   - Do you think of Coinbase as layer one,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.740]   layer two, layer three?
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   Now that said, there's so many products
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.780]   that are under the Coinbase umbrella
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.180]   that it's hard to answer that question,
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.660]   but what do you think?
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.500]   - Yeah.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.340]   - Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.420]   (laughs)
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.900]   - So, you know, usually when people are using those terms,
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.740]   layer one, layer two,
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.940]   so they're referring to like layer one would be
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.840]   the blockchain, layer one blockchain itself,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.820]   like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.180]   not like a centralized service like Coinbase
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:51.740]   or even our decentralized self-custodial wallet.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.300]   So, yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.580]   These are the decentralized protocols
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.380]   that we're integrating, but we are,
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.780]   Coinbase itself is not those.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.620]   - Yes, but layer two is the thing that
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.100]   was basically doing transactions
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.220]   without the settlement on the blockchain.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.220]   And so you get to have some of the benefits
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.260]   of faster transactions without the security
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.420]   associated with the blockchain.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.300]   And layer three is, I suppose,
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.060]   sort of apps built on top of that.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.860]   So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor,
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.940]   he considers Coinbase a layer three technology.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.220]   - Interesting, okay.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:34.460]   - I don't even, I'm not really particularly familiar
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.460]   with this kind of distinction of layer three and two.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.380]   I don't see them as fundamentally different.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.900]   But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that,
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.180]   is there some layer two like of magic happening
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.220]   in order to make transactions associated
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.340]   with the blockchain happen instant,
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.460]   so that they're quick?
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.620]   So that-- - On Coinbase?
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.620]   - On Coinbase, yeah.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.140]   Is there some magic going on?
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.820]   'Cause you're, okay, we should say,
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.980]   how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.420]   So it's more than two.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.580]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:08.940]   - It's a lot more than two. - Yeah.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.500]   - So you have to understand,
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.580]   you have to incorporate all these technologies.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.900]   - Yeah.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.140]   - So how do you make that magic
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.820]   of sort of universal transactions happen
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.220]   across all of these different cryptocurrencies?
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.580]   - There's our centralized products
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:25.820]   and decentralized products, right?
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.100]   The centralized products,
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:31.100]   we are storing that crypto for you.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.460]   And so if you're moving from one of your accounts
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.100]   to another account, like an ETH1 account to ETH2 account,
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.860]   or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:40.700]   to your ETH centralized,
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.540]   so we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster.
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.420]   And it saves the customer fees
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.020]   and it just confirms instantly.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.740]   But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain, right?
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.260]   So you can also send any Bitcoin address
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.940]   or Ethereum address, for instance,
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.420]   and that is putting the transaction on chain.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.300]   Now our decentralized products like Coinbase Wallet,
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.020]   the self-custodial wallet,
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.580]   every transaction is happening on chain with that.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.700]   And so basically, it just shows a little bit
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.980]   of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.380]   Like in the early days,
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.220]   these networks were not scalable.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.820]   And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.540]   And so we had to do sort of these hacks,
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.100]   like moving the crypto off chain,
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.540]   if you were moving between your own accounts
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.460]   and stuff like that.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.580]   Otherwise, the minor fees would have just eaten us alive
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.420]   as a company, right?
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.500]   And we, yeah.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.020]   But now that like, the blockchains are starting to scale.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.940]   There's a whole bunch more work
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:30.780]   that needs to be done on that,
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.260]   and we're getting L2 solutions.
[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.780]   So I think more and more of the transactions
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.620]   are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.860]   And we shouldn't be like,
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.060]   ideally, we shouldn't be doing that many transactions.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.260]   You know, off chain,
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.060]   just internal Coinbase ledger or something.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.740]   That's not really in the spirit of crypto.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.860]   - So when you say on chain,
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.260]   that includes like a lightning network.
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:54.860]   That includes layer two technology
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.740]   that the blockchain proposes.
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.580]   - Yeah.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.940]   - So you're, when you, yeah, okay.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.700]   So I guess I was asking how much fun magic
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.420]   is happening off chain within Coinbase.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.300]   And you're saying in the early days, you had to,
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.620]   but you're trying to do less and less.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.620]   - So look, there's a bunch of like high frequency traders
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.180]   that use the centralized products
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.300]   and even just regular retail people,
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.660]   like they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.460]   And they're trying to, it actually,
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.540]   back of the envelope, you know,
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.180]   calculated this out at one point,
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.780]   and just like, it would be completely infeasible
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.140]   for like high frequency traders
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.780]   to put everything on chain at this point.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.420]   That's basically what DEXs are doing.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.620]   And so both are important.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.660]   I think more and more is going to move decentralized
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:36.900]   over time, which is great.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:37.740]   And we're basically-
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.340]   - DEXs are decentralized exchanges, by the way.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.180]   - Yeah.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.460]   - So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.860]   to move decentralized over time,
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.740]   but I don't, the centralized things aren't going away
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.220]   for like a long time.
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.100]   It's a decade from now, there's going to be some
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.620]   big institution or pension fund or central bank
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:58.900]   that's like, all right, we got to hold crypto.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.740]   Let's set up the account in a centralized way.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.980]   So that's fine.
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.180]   Both are important.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.260]   - Do you know the number of cryptocurrencies currently
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.260]   on Coinbase?
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.140]   Do you know that number?
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.620]   - It's over a hundred, but it depends.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.020]   It depends what jurisdiction you're in and, you know,
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.380]   are you an institution versus retail?
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.940]   There's so many different categories now.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.100]   - But over a hundred.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.580]   - Yeah.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:25.780]   - So what does it take to become an asset,
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.180]   to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase,
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.220]   to add your technology to Coinbase?
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.420]   - Okay, well, so we're trying to get away from this idea
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.220]   of being listed on Coinbase as being seen as like
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.380]   an endorsement or something,
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.660]   because I actually think it's very important
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.660]   that we are not considered judge and jury about, you know,
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.420]   like imagine it was the early days of the internet
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.660]   and you were like, what's a good webpage
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.500]   and what's a bad webpage?
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.700]   Like you would have been totally wrong.
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:57.460]   Or anytime big tech companies try to make these review
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.020]   boards of like, you know, Apple famously gets in trouble
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.780]   for this a lot with their app store review process, right?
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.140]   And so something that you think like a committee of people
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.180]   somewhere thinks look silly may turn out to be
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.260]   the next big thing, right?
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.620]   And so it's very difficult.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.460]   So what do we do?
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:15.060]   I mean, we basically have a test of legality, right?
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.820]   We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.660]   If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:25.100]   And there's a very rigorous process we go through for that.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.660]   Just currently the way the laws are in the US,
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.940]   you can't do that.
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.220]   And we've been, we acquired a broker to your license
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.060]   from the SEC.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.860]   We're trying to work with them to get that operational.
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.300]   And hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities,
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.700]   but today that's not possible in the US at least.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.940]   Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.540]   of the crypto asset.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.300]   Does it, do we see that there's some flaw
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.060]   in the smart contract or, you know,
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.340]   a way that somebody could manipulate it
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.280]   without the customer's permission?
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.740]   We look at some compliance pieces to it as well,
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.540]   like the actors behind it and like, you know,
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.140]   their any kind of criminal history, anything like that.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.980]   But if we believe it meets our listing standards,
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.300]   basically this test of legality and everything
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.180]   for customer protection,
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.500]   then we wanna list it because we want the market
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.660]   to at that point decide.
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:12.860]   And it's kind of like,
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:16.140]   it's kind of like Amazon or something like that,
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.880]   where, you know, a product might have three stars
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.940]   or it might have five stars,
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.460]   but if it starts to get one star consistently,
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.680]   like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.700]   or something like maybe Amazon will remove it.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.080]   But otherwise you wanna let the market decide
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.180]   what these things are.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.920]   So that's generally how we do it.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.220]   And by the way, more and more of these assets,
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.420]   I think, especially like low market cap assets
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.520]   are gonna be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.640]   It's not that we,
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.260]   we don't need to list every asset on a centralized exchange.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.820]   I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.660]   And then it becomes an even,
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.900]   it's even more clear to people,
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:54.020]   like this is not some endorsement by Coinbase of like,
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.400]   this asset's good and this one's bad.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.940]   Like, you know, my belief is there's gonna be millions
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.060]   of these assets over time.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.380]   And so I hope it doesn't like make news
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.820]   every time we add one in the future, basically.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.020]   - Yeah, I wonder how you get there
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:10.620]   because even I look to Coinbase for example,
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.060]   you know, people, as you can imagine,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.340]   sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:20.340]   and all that, like you should interview our sort of this,
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.180]   the founder of this particular coin, right?
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.020]   - Yeah.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:27.340]   - And it's so hard for me to know what's,
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.700]   first of all, what's the interesting technology?
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.820]   Who's a scammer or not?
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:37.340]   Who's actually legitimately representing
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:42.340]   an ambitious new thing versus a scam.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:46.180]   And I, you know, there's very few sources
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:50.540]   of like verification signal.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.060]   And unfortunately Coinbase in part has become
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.580]   a little bit of that too.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.500]   And you're trying to get away from that
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.740]   because you're trying to get as many,
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   sort of let the people decide.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.940]   So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.660]   where the people could rate.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.340]   - Yeah, so I think we'll actually probably add
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:09.060]   like user ratings and reviews.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.460]   So, and we'll be very cautious about like,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.060]   you know, these are real people.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:17.340]   There's a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.780]   So I think wisdom of the crowds is good
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.940]   in terms of getting feedback on items.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:24.180]   But we also, we're gonna do our own review,
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.180]   which I mentioned earlier, right?
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.620]   Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.700]   to be listed on our site.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:29.540]   - Yeah.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:32.220]   - So I think, yeah, both are important.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.300]   - How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:39.100]   - Well, you can see a few things.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.140]   So, you know, I hate to use the word scam
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:42.580]   because a lot of these are judgment calls.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.140]   You gotta, I kind of, a court may or a jury
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:45.980]   may land either way.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.980]   But things that would be red flags to look at would be,
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:53.620]   you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.800]   or insiders with short vesting periods,
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.940]   you know, are, does the background of the founders,
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.820]   like they may have criminal records
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:08.260]   or if they've perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.340]   There's a difference between something which is
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.540]   just a me too product that's like,
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.100]   doesn't have anything interesting about it
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.220]   and something that's an actual fraud or outright scam.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.300]   And you have to, a lot of this data,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.540]   what's cool about it is that it's now available on chain.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.500]   You can look at like the tokenomics behind it
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.340]   and see who owns it.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.540]   - Tokenomics, I love that term.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.340]   - Yeah, and are they selling it, you know,
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.020]   in like inappropriately or are they pumping it
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.160]   on like YouTube and Twitter and making promises about,
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.260]   hey, the value of this thing may be a higher in the future.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:43.260]   And like, all those are just big, big no-nos that we would,
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:45.860]   you know, we just don't wanna go there.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.260]   So our whole thing is like,
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.940]   we want to enable the innovation in this space,
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.660]   but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.380]   of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.420]   or get rich quick thing.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.260]   So.
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.100]   - It's a tricky industry,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.660]   'cause I'm trying to figure out who to, you know,
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.580]   what's interesting to understand, to research.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.420]   - Yeah.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.860]   - And it's hard to know.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.100]   Let me ask you about a tricky one to add
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.460]   to a centralized exchange,
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.300]   which is privacy-preserving cryptocurrency.
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.380]   So like Monero.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.220]   - Yeah.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.660]   - Is that technically difficult or is that why,
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.580]   why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one,
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:29.580]   but like privacy-preserving cryptocurrency blockchains,
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.220]   why is that, is that ever possible to add?
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.100]   - So that's a great question.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.860]   So the answer is maybe.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.260]   So here's the reason why.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.660]   So because we're a regulated financial service business,
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.300]   we have various licenses to do that.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.460]   We are regulated by various regulators.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.020]   Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote,
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:56.020]   reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity,
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.620]   you know, an AML program, anti-money laundering, right?
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.820]   And so if a coin is 100% anonymous
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.500]   and we can't really do blockchain analytics
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.780]   to track source of funds
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:09.660]   and where these things might be going,
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.660]   it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.980]   that's defensible.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:19.380]   Now there are privacy-preserving coins like Zcash,
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.180]   which have something called a view key.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.260]   And a view key is basically another key,
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.020]   which allows you to de-anonymize the transactions
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.060]   in specific situations where you want that.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.780]   So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.380]   And one of the ways we got comfortable with that
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.140]   is that when you're buying it on Coinbase,
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.340]   you know, you can basically have a view key.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.060]   The transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.620]   And we can see where it goes afterwards
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.380]   and do our whole standard program.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.980]   Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road,
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.580]   I mean, people could eventually
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.780]   turn on privacy-preserving aspects.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.820]   So, you know, these are tough judgment calls,
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.700]   but at least in terms of our interaction
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.900]   with the customer and everything,
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.540]   we feel comfortable at that.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.340]   I think there's a broader point here,
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:03.220]   which is that I actually think privacy coins
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.300]   are a good thing for the world
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.740]   and they should be allowed.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.900]   And more like, you know,
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.740]   despite we've made this judgment call
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.860]   to operate in a regulated and safe and compliant way,
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.140]   but just taking my Coinbase hat off for a minute,
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.540]   I think the world would be a better place
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.060]   if there were more privacy coins,
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.700]   because it's kind of like the internet
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:21.740]   when it first came online,
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:25.500]   like there was no HTTPS, everything was HTTP.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.580]   And there was, you know,
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.100]   so people were afraid to put their credit cards
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.540]   on the internet and your messages could be intercepted
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.380]   and all this stuff.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.500]   And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.300]   with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.220]   Like, and financial information
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.460]   is like the most important information to keep private.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.580]   Right?
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.180]   So there's times where,
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:46.020]   like let's say you're running a charity or something
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:47.900]   and you want to have total auditability,
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.700]   transparency for the whole world,
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.260]   who donated and where did the money go?
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.100]   That's great.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.220]   You want it to be public.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.100]   But if it's like your personal money
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.060]   or something like that,
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.060]   you don't want to be broadcasting that to the whole world.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.580]   And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing,
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:01.900]   you know, pseudonymously,
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.700]   'cause like, but it is a public ledger.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.780]   And so if you can know who owns each address,
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.740]   you can basically de-anonymize it.
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.460]   I, you know, I think basically the people should fight
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.940]   for privacy and freedoms of all kinds,
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.980]   but privacy of money is a good thing.
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.500]   So I would like to see more of that in the future.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.740]   - You've chosen with Coinbase
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:24.740]   to have a seat at the table with the regulators.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:25.820]   - Yeah.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.820]   - So what kind of conversations are there at that table?
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.500]   What are the regulations like?
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.860]   What is the level of understanding with regulators?
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.140]   What are they worried about?
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.260]   What are they thinking about?
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.340]   What are the positive
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.580]   and what are the negative regulations that you're facing?
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:47.100]   That you're educating, struggling with,
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.780]   pushing back on, supporting, all that kind of stuff.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.220]   - Yeah.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.020]   Oh man, there's so many, 'cause we're,
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.540]   I mean, we're live in like, you know,
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.980]   maybe a hundred countries or more at this point.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.900]   So the conversations are all over the map.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:01.260]   I'm trying to think what broad strokes
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.100]   I could paint for you.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.260]   So I'd say one trend that's positive
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:07.460]   is that basically regulators around the world
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.180]   are more and more,
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.460]   over the last five years I would say,
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.780]   it's more and more common to find a regulator today asking,
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.740]   how can we preserve the innovation potential
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:21.140]   of this technology while keeping the bad actors out
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.500]   than it was five years ago where they were saying,
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.780]   this is all bad activity, how do we prevent it?
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.500]   And so maybe this is-
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:32.460]   - When you say more and more, what fraction?
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.300]   (laughing)
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.500]   - Okay, so just, I'll give you like a US specific example,
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.220]   although we operate in many countries.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.380]   So when I go to DC now, I would say,
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.980]   you know, 50, 60% of the people who I meet with
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:48.100]   are basically, you know, they're in the camp of,
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:50.300]   crypto has a lot of potential,
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.340]   we should regulate it to make sure the bad people
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.580]   don't do something bad with it,
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:56.260]   but this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside,
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.380]   we should basically create the awful regulation
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:02.020]   and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.220]   to happen in the US.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:06.620]   That's a huge change from just three years ago
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.380]   where it was probably 30% of people saying that,
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.420]   now it's like 60, it's like almost double.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:15.420]   It's getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics in DC.
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.580]   I'd say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.900]   are like willing to say something negative,
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.580]   like they actually think it's net negative,
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.700]   it's like, it's really hard to defend that position
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.660]   at this point 'cause almost like one in five Americans
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.100]   have used or tried crypto at this point.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.940]   So you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.440]   if you say that at this point.
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:37.260]   You know, especially with NFTs and all these things,
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.180]   like a huge segment of people who don't even care
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.660]   about investing or whatever came into the space.
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:46.660]   And then basically that same conversation is happening,
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:50.820]   but, you know, delayed by a few years in like India
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.100]   and Europe and in some Asian countries.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:56.260]   And some countries have really embraced crypto
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.100]   and they're like trying to really,
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.900]   they're ahead of where the US is
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:04.100]   'cause they're trying to actually attract the best startups
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.820]   and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai and the UK
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.500]   and Australia and all are kind of pushing good regulation.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.500]   El Salvador actually, I guess, adopted it as like Bitcoin
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500]   as a legal tender.
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.560]   There was another country, Central African Republic,
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.220]   I think that is supposedly did that as well.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.500]   But, you know, there's countries like China
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.060]   that are more autocratic that are saying,
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:24.540]   "Hey, this is a threat to our power
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.380]   and like we're gonna try to really curtail it."
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.820]   - So what kind of regulations are there
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.860]   that you feel the most that are limiting
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.220]   or that are empowering?
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:35.260]   Like, is there specific examples?
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.060]   - Yeah, okay, so, I mean, basically,
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.980]   I think the securities laws in the US need to be clarified
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:45.580]   about what, crypto is many different things.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.620]   That's what people don't realize.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:49.660]   So like some crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:53.140]   and many others are probably more like commodities.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.260]   They're not controlled by any one person, you know,
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:58.140]   like anyway, there's people who wanna raise money
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.300]   for a company that sounds more like a security
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.380]   that should be regulated by the SEC.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.540]   Commodities regulated by the CFTC.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.380]   Then there's some cryptocurrencies
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.220]   which are more like currencies, like stable coins
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.780]   and central bank digital currencies.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.860]   And those are probably, you know,
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.140]   should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:16.580]   And then there's a whole another category
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.340]   of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:21.740]   They're NFTs like artwork or they're metaverse items
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.580]   or decentralized identity or voting.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:28.580]   And so I think that there's a very unhelpful point of view
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:34.220]   out there by some folks, which is, hey, this is all,
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.240]   most of this is like bad activity.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.740]   We need to shut it down.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.860]   So we're just gonna pursue enforcement actions
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:40.980]   or something like that.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.020]   Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.780]   And I think the people of the US don't feel that way anymore
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.020]   'cause a lot of them are using this stuff.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:49.180]   And their general view is,
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.820]   there's a lot of upside potential here.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.940]   We can all agree, let's get rid of the fraud and the scams.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:54.380]   We all wanna get rid of that.
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:58.900]   So let's create a relatively simple test, which says,
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:02.700]   you know, if it's like, nobody controls more than 20%
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:03.700]   of it or some threshold,
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.540]   it probably is more like a commodity.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.580]   If someone's raising money for,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.980]   they're selling this thing for a business,
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.100]   then it's probably a security.
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:14.360]   And then, you know, if it's more like a medium of exchange,
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.200]   it's a currency.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.060]   And if it's none of those things,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.300]   maybe it's artwork or whatever.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.460]   A legal test like that would help clarify who,
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.580]   which regulator is regulating what.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.060]   And then, you know, we also wanna have probably
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.740]   like a sandbox for innovation,
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:30.420]   where if you're a startup and you're doing less than,
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:31.720]   I don't know, some number,
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.980]   less than some amount of payment volume
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.380]   or customer funds you're storing,
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.700]   it's like, just let those things get off the ground
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.540]   without a soul crushing amount of legal bills,
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.880]   you know, and uncertainty.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.020]   So if the US can get there, that would be great.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.500]   I think a bunch of other countries now
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.260]   are rushing around the world to sort of
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:52.560]   create that regulation that it does attract innovation.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.100]   And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.100]   and stuff, they're starting to look at proposed regulation.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.100]   I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.280]   can help in that conversation too.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.860]   We have a whole policy effort.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.060]   I think actually crypto policy efforts
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.100]   are like probably one of the biggest things in DC right now.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:14.100]   So it moves slow at the speed of government, but yeah.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.260]   And in the meantime, we're just trying to help
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.460]   more and more people use crypto
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.900]   'cause ultimately that's what, in the democracies,
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.060]   that's what they care about.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.740]   Like they'll do what the people of the country want.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.020]   - So you want governments to start understanding
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.460]   the differences between in the crypto space,
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.460]   commodities, securities, currencies, NFTs.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:34.020]   I still don't understand.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.060]   What are the supposed to make sense of NFTs?
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.100]   What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.980]   - Yeah, so-
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.820]   - Is it the other categories?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.500]   - Yeah, you know, most NFTs you could think of
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.100]   as like artwork, although it's,
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.020]   who knows where it's gonna go?
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:49.860]   It could be-
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:50.700]   - You mentioned metaverse, right?
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:54.860]   You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:55.700]   - Yeah, like-
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.180]   - Isn't everything art, man?
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.860]   - People sell on virtual land in NFTs.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.740]   I actually, I bought this NFT that's like,
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.740]   it's like citizenship in this like city,
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.780]   Dow in Wyoming, like I've never been there,
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:11.540]   but it's almost like a badge or attestation
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.340]   like to get access to this location.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:17.380]   There's like people doing like tickets to events,
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.660]   like, you know, they're called a POAPs,
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:23.620]   like proof of attendance and things like that.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.820]   So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.940]   It could get, and that's the danger.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:31.740]   You don't wanna try to like define the regulation
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.380]   if you don't even know where this thing's gonna go, so.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:37.540]   - And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.900]   - Yeah, education, advocacy.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:40.740]   We're just trying to be like
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.620]   a helpful educational resource essentially.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.180]   And then if they give us feedback and like,
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.740]   hey, don't do this or don't, or do this,
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.580]   like we're more than happy to do anything that's requested.
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.500]   We generally go get licenses
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.820]   and we've just tried to do the right thing
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.940]   in the absence of clarity,
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.180]   because if it's not clear what the law says,
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.180]   then you should just basically do good things
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:02.780]   that you think may be required in the future
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.100]   to show good faith effort towards the right thing.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.700]   And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field,
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:11.060]   which is, you know, a whole topic in itself.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.820]   - So if you are at the table,
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.280]   I mean, this is less the case in the United States,
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.780]   but can government agencies seize a person cryptocurrency
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.820]   by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.340]   So when you're centralized,
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.180]   they have a phone number to call.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.440]   - Okay, so this is a complicated topic.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.780]   Like if you really wanna be sure that,
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:36.660]   this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:37.940]   Like with self-custodial wallets,
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:40.180]   like with Coinbase wallet and bracing decentralization,
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.140]   they wanna avoid that.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:44.740]   Now in the US there is rule of law, right?
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:47.220]   So we have reasonable protections in place around
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.460]   like search and seizure and things like that.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.660]   You know, Coinbase does,
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.420]   we publish transparency reports on this.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.940]   We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:00.300]   from various countries around the world.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:04.700]   And there are situations where we have been ordered
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.740]   to freeze accounts, things like that.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.420]   You know, we have to follow the law.
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.980]   Is there's no other way to put it.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.780]   We're a regulated financial service business.
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:13.620]   And so-
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.960]   - If the money is used as part of breaking the law,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.860]   that's what that, in a particular jurisdiction,
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.500]   in a particular-
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.920]   - Right, and then the other thing,
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.820]   sometimes we will actually get court orders
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.220]   or subpoenas that are overly broad.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:30.940]   We've seen, so they need to follow due process, right?
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.340]   And so we've seen some in the past that were like,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.580]   "Well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts."
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:39.140]   And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.740]   and like pushed back on some of these and said like,
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.940]   "What is your, the probable cause?
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.460]   And has the threshold been met?"
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.940]   And like, we've won some of those cases
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.960]   on behalf of our customers.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.100]   So yeah, it's actually really,
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:52.040]   it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating as a,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.140]   you know, as a large business,
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:56.740]   you spend a lot of resources basically interacting
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.500]   with inbound requests by all kinds of lawyers and people
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.700]   and requesting things.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.020]   And some of them are silly and ridiculous
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.420]   and you have to push back and say no.
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.840]   And so it's kind of a tax on every company
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.780]   at a certain size,
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.340]   which ultimately gets passed on to the customer
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:15.180]   in higher fees.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.540]   So you have to employ armies of lawyers
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.380]   to deal with this stuff.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.820]   - Can you educate me on something?
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.820]   How much innovation is there in the legal space?
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.300]   So for lawyers working with Coinbase,
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.780]   because it's such a new cutting edge thing.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.580]   So you're, there's a lot of gray area
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.500]   you're supposed to be operating under.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:40.100]   Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.100]   (both laughing)
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.380]   Like how much precedence is there,
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.500]   I guess is what I'm asking.
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.620]   I mean, just like you said, three years.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.580]   It's kind of a new space.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.420]   - Yeah.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.580]   Well, it's probably very hard to be a lawyer at Coinbase
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.820]   and very fun because, you know,
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:57.220]   whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast,
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:02.220]   there isn't a lot of case law and just precedent set.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.460]   So that's also an opportunity for you
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:05.420]   to go create that stuff.
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.620]   And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.700]   is like, take a complex situation
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.300]   where you have to balance difficult things.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.100]   Like how do we prevent bad activity,
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.140]   but still enable an innovation?
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.900]   That's a hard question.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:18.460]   And there's, you can go draft legislation
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.740]   and circulate it to policymakers
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:23.500]   or come up with these policies and, you know,
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.340]   how do you operate a business in an environment
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.780]   where the law is just unclear, right?
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:29.980]   It's like, try to do the right thing,
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:33.820]   but like, you know, strike the right balance.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:36.220]   So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:37.780]   Very creative stuff.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.540]   - You mentioned one of the things you're focused on
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:41.020]   is expanding the number of people,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:46.020]   maybe a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.180]   Where are we at now?
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.940]   How do we get to a billion?
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.620]   - As of Q4 last year,
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:53.540]   we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase,
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.060]   but in any given quarter, only, you know,
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:00.100]   maybe like 10 or a little more million of those
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.020]   are like really active.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.860]   So, and then if you look at globally,
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.180]   I think some of the estimates I've seen is maybe
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:09.180]   there's like 200 million people or something like that
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.500]   who have ever used or tried crypto.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:15.580]   So we're along, you know, we're a ways from a billion,
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.540]   but it's not like that far off.
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.900]   - How do you get there?
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.300]   - Yeah, okay. - How do you get to a billion?
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.380]   - So a few things.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.740]   One is the blockchains have got to become
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.700]   way more scalable.
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:27.980]   It's kind of like we're all running dial-up modems
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:28.980]   and we need broadband.
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.740]   And so it's just like too expensive,
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.180]   too slow to do all these transactions.
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.020]   And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability,
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.900]   you know, we'll see another order of magnitude
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.540]   kind of come out just from that.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.860]   I think the second one would be more clear regulation.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.820]   That would help a lot.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:51.620]   I do talk to, you know, pension funds and, you know,
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.780]   various asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and stuff.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:55.700]   And a lot of them tell me,
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.740]   we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today,
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:02.140]   but we really would rather have like 20% in there.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.540]   But what we're waiting for is more clear regulation
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.820]   coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying,
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.980]   these assets are commodities regulated by SEC,
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:13.700]   these are by SEC, these are by treasury, whatever.
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.460]   So that would be a big unlock.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:19.700]   - Do transactions, so one of the things that you mentioned,
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.460]   payments, sorry. - Yeah.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.860]   - Well, does that unlock a lot of users?
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.060]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.220]   I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:30.060]   People sending money home to their families
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.940]   and other countries where the fees are super high.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.660]   So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.020]   and there's more global adoption,
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:40.220]   like I think we'll see remittance quarters
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:42.300]   move over to crypto a lot.
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.420]   There's also just, the other thing that's driving
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.740]   a lot of crypto adoption is basically
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.300]   the creation of more and more third-party apps.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.180]   So, or dApps, they're sometimes called decentralized apps.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:55.700]   So a lot of startups now, you know how like,
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.540]   used in the early 2000s, they called them dot-com startups,
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:59.980]   but now you don't need to say dot-com
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.500]   'cause everybody's using the internet.
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.380]   And so now there's like hundreds or thousands
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.940]   of these crypto startups, but I think in the future,
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.180]   you won't need to call them crypto startups
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.260]   'cause they'll just be called startups
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:11.900]   'cause everyone's using the internet and crypto and whatever.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:15.820]   So anyway, the use cases, the utility of crypto
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.780]   is getting better and better with like
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:20.460]   all these third-party apps getting funded and created.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.660]   - Do you think there's gonna be a killer
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.940]   or a set of killer dApps,
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.740]   like a thing where nobody can live without?
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.300]   Are we still waiting for that?
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.220]   - There's gonna be a bunch of them.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.500]   It's just like, it's like the internet,
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.740]   like what were the killer web companies?
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:37.020]   You know, like Uber and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:40.420]   And like, so there's gonna be some big winners,
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:42.620]   but there'll be thousands of,
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.020]   this is basically the new,
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:46.740]   it's like what happened with the dot-com startups
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.580]   in the early 2000s.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.140]   It's like a lot of the best entrepreneurs
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.820]   are building crypto startups now.
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:54.100]   So tons of venture money flowing into the space,
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.620]   a lot of smart young people, so.
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.620]   - Do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:01.700]   will become the reserve currency of the world at some point?
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.700]   - 'Cause this is kind of a controversial idea,
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.380]   but I actually think yes.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:08.540]   I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.780]   a reserve currency of the world.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:13.300]   So, you know, I've been reading Ray Dalio recently
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.620]   with his new book, like "The Changing World Order."
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.860]   And I thought it was a really well-researched book.
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.740]   He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:24.780]   He looks at like empires and, you know,
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.660]   going back to various Chinese empires,
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.060]   the Dutch and Ottomans and everybody,
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.780]   and how did they rise?
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:31.620]   And they were able to have the reserve currency
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:32.940]   as they rose.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.220]   And what produced that?
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.620]   Like it came from, you know, good education and innovation
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:39.180]   and better trade and anyway.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.620]   So the US by some measures is kind of,
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.540]   looks like it's maybe had a really good run
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.820]   and it's coming down a little bit.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.820]   And China is kind of coming up.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.140]   Who knows how that'll play out by the way?
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.460]   Like the world is very complicated.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.020]   It could, that could switch.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:59.180]   But I guess if the US dollar is gonna be seeing
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:00.620]   more inflation in the future,
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.900]   the Chinese Yuan is not like necessarily better, right?
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.500]   I mean, they have a ton of debt as well.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:13.220]   And, you know, it's not like you could really,
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:15.500]   that the Yuan could be inflated as well, right?
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.020]   It probably will be.
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.940]   And so I do think that there's this group of people today,
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:24.460]   which probably most traditional, I don't know,
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:27.340]   like the people who run big banks
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.380]   and like governments and stuff,
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.980]   that they're not, this is not really on their radar today,
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:32.740]   but I think there's basically a group of younger people
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.980]   in that kind of, you know, 25, 35 year old range
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.540]   who are tech savvy.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.420]   They're starting to think of crypto as like
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:42.100]   the primary thing in their financial life.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.900]   It's like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.900]   and I use dollars or euros or whatever.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.420]   If I happen to need something,
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.580]   I convert it to that at the last minute.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.340]   It's like, if I go on, if I'm traveling,
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.060]   I might convert some local currency in the moment,
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:57.100]   but that's not where I hold most of my wealth.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:43:01.580]   So this segment of the population is not like massive yet
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:02.580]   from a GDP point of view,
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:05.580]   but I think it's a leading indicator
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:06.700]   of where things could be going.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:07.940]   And this is actually good for the world.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:11.340]   It's kind of like, especially if China does continue to rise
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:13.620]   and it has a more authoritarian view,
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.900]   it'll be kind of this very centralized East
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:18.740]   versus a decentralized West,
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:21.860]   where people are in the West, in the free world,
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:24.420]   really kind of embracing crypto
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:27.740]   in a more open, fair, free, global financial system,
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:31.020]   which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.900]   And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency,
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.180]   the gold standard of the crypto economy.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.260]   So that's pretty crazy.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.340]   - Yeah, the gold standard.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.620]   I mean, it's also like with Ray Dalio,
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:47.820]   I feel like China will drive a lot of this,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.900]   either in response or directly.
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:52.340]   I mean, I think the ruble,
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.380]   I'm not paying as close attention to the financial systems,
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:59.940]   but I think they're trying to tie it to gold once again.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.660]   So that's an interesting,
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.580]   maybe it'll be one of the more authoritarian regime
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.900]   that will switch to a Bitcoin standard first.
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:11.340]   And then it's the West that will,
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:14.900]   out of that pressure will catch up
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.260]   versus the other way around.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.100]   It's fascinating to think of what is the forcing function,
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.260]   what kind of perturbation is required to switch,
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.540]   to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:32.660]   But it could be, as you're saying,
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:34.940]   just waiting for the people that are young now
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.620]   that are embracing crypto
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.980]   to enter the positions of power, essentially.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:42.340]   But I hope that's not the case,
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:47.340]   'cause that's, if for any innovation, we have to wait,
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.940]   I'm sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.860]   - Yeah.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.700]   - That's not an efficient way to make change.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.460]   - Yeah, that's a super interesting topic
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:01.460]   of how people's minds become less plastic as they age.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:04.700]   - I guess it's a feature.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.540]   It's called wisdom,
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.100]   but then we also need the wild ones to explore,
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.120]   exploration versus exploitation.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.500]   You wrote a blog post that's really interesting
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:18.540]   in September 2020 titled Coinbase is a mission-focused
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.660]   company, like what we're talking about.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:23.540]   So one interesting thing you said in that blog post
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:27.540]   is that we're not going to be distracted
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.980]   by sort of activism within the company
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:35.160]   that's not related to the mission of the company.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.580]   Now, that's a rare thing for a company to state,
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:42.320]   for a company CEO to state, especially in this climate.
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:47.520]   Can you, first of all, describe in a little more detail
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.320]   what you meant?
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.400]   Did you receive blowback for this?
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.620]   - I definitely received some blowback,
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.020]   but yeah, I'll describe what I meant.
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:57.680]   And if you wanna talk about how it came to that too,
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.520]   we can talk about that.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.440]   But what I meant is that there's a lot of companies
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.360]   right now, including tech companies,
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.440]   but not exclusively where,
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.420]   I think like great companies,
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.680]   they have an important mission.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.080]   They're trying to do something really good for the world.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.640]   And unfortunately, they're getting a little distracted
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:20.840]   from that at times because of employee activism
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.340]   that is causing the company to basically jump
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:29.080]   into whatever the current thing is and try to help,
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.760]   is like the positive interpretation.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.480]   The negative interpretation would be to virtue signal.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.480]   And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.440]   to, this is largely an American company phenomenon,
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.280]   by the way.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.640]   I do worry that this is making America less competitive,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:46.480]   even though I think of myself
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.800]   as kind of internationally minded,
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.040]   but I am a US citizen, have a lot of my whole life here.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.960]   So when we put out this statement,
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.000]   we had employees that were not in the US
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.180]   who were confused by it.
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:59.520]   They were like, why did Brian need to say that?
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:02.460]   We're just saying you're gonna work, focus on work at work.
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:04.460]   That's what we were doing already.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.620]   And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities,
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.300]   in particular, where we had employees
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:15.300]   that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved,
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.060]   where I think people really wanted the company
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:24.060]   they worked at to be almost acting
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.240]   like the government or something,
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.180]   and trying to solve the hardest societal issues
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.380]   and at least have an opinion on it,
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:33.320]   if not contribute to the solution on almost everything.
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:39.780]   And for me, it was a very uncomfortable situation
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.620]   for me as a CEO.
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.020]   I'd never quite been in this situation
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.060]   where most of the time when employees in the past
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.460]   were kind of asking me questions,
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.580]   they would be asking about,
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:51.100]   how do we make this product better?
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.340]   What do we do with this competitor?
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.700]   What about this regulator?
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:56.700]   And it got to a place around that time
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.380]   where most of the questions we were receiving
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:02.060]   were, I think, even about things not related to the company.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.260]   They were about broader societal issues,
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:04.380]   like, Brian, what's your stance
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.660]   on XYZ controversial thing?
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.860]   And I often didn't have an opinion on these.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.100]   These were really hard questions, right?
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.820]   And I felt like it was distracting the company.
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.780]   People internally were getting into fights a lot, too,
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:19.620]   like disagreeing with each other.
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:22.500]   There was a thing where Slack internally
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.140]   was turning into social media almost
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.340]   with people putting in flame wars.
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.980]   So, and this culminated, by the way,
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:31.300]   with a walkout that happened in the company.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:34.660]   We had received some demands from employee groups
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:35.500]   about various things,
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.660]   and there was basically an antagonistic thing
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:39.220]   with management and employees.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:42.020]   I was like, we're all on the same team here.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.260]   If you wanna be antagonistic,
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.500]   let's do it with somebody else outside the company
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.500]   that we're trying to improve the world in that dimension.
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.740]   So, yeah, eventually I was like,
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.780]   okay, the company is not aligned on this.
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:57.380]   I just don't feel, I don't like the job as CEO, frankly.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.820]   If the job is to come in here every day
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:01.140]   and have to squirm in front of
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:03.140]   these most difficult societal questions,
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.380]   I don't think I wanna do that job.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.700]   So either they're gonna have to go,
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:08.140]   or I'm gonna have to go.
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.380]   And I founded this company,
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:10.340]   and I really believe in the mission,
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.380]   so they're gonna have to go.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:14.140]   And what I realized was that,
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:16.940]   so I basically, I made an exit package available
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.340]   to anybody who wasn't on board with this direction.
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.180]   5% of employees took it.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:23.900]   I got the company realigned towards this mission.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.140]   We're all here to do work.
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.460]   By the way, people can, they can go do anything
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.740]   like political or social activism outside of work.
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:30.580]   It's totally fine.
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:33.340]   Like we all, everybody has stuff like that
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.220]   in their personal life.
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.300]   But while at work, we can also disagree at work,
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.780]   by the way, on the work.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.780]   This is not like a no disagreement culture.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:42.300]   Like we should, let's try to get the truth.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.020]   But don't bring stuff into work
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.260]   that's just gonna create division.
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.420]   Make the workplace a refuge from division
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:49.420]   about all these crazy things.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.700]   And like, we're all aligned here to work on the mission.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.620]   Let's do that.
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:57.220]   - Yeah, that was really, really, really refreshing to hear.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.060]   So this is me speaking,
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.660]   but there's a sense when companies
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:03.460]   take on these issues publicly,
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:06.100]   from a CEO position or anywhere else,
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.920]   that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.500]   versus solving a particular problem.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.620]   Because to solve a particular problem,
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.820]   you really have to, really put in a huge,
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.500]   you have to hire a huge number,
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.900]   you basically have to create a company
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.620]   within a company to take on a particular thing.
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.460]   - Right.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.420]   - But if you allow yourself to internally care
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.580]   about a particular issue,
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:34.180]   you're basically pacifying some number of employee,
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.980]   like making sure Slack doesn't get out of hand.
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:40.140]   And then you're doing this kind of, from my perspective,
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:43.740]   especially on issues I care about, fake virtue signaling,
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.540]   basically trying to understand
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.200]   what will make me look the best,
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.700]   what would make the company look the best
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:50.260]   in this particular aspect.
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:52.100]   And it just seems very shallow.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:54.260]   And it's optimizing for the wrong thing,
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.860]   not for the solving of the problems,
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:01.860]   but for the making yourself look like the good guy,
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:04.940]   and trying to then leverage that to say,
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.500]   I'm the good guy in all situations.
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.740]   And it's the wrong thing.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:13.860]   And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader,
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:16.540]   it's also creating division,
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:19.300]   unnecessary division within people.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:21.260]   Like they get, yeah, there's something about us
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:25.820]   who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.820]   They really bring out the emotion.
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.660]   - Yeah.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.840]   - And I think that probably, as you were saying,
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.900]   that emotion is even probably okay, maybe productive,
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.660]   when that emotion has to do with the mission of the company.
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:40.400]   Like you really care about those disagreements
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.860]   versus like something that has nothing to do
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.140]   with the particular,
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:50.140]   with increasing economic freedom using crypto.
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.700]   Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.420]   But it was so refreshing because it's rare.
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.300]   Why do you think that's a rare?
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:59.820]   So the city you're mentioning,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:01.960]   I mean, there's a bunch of cities,
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.960]   but San Francisco is one such city with that culture.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.340]   And it's sad because San Francisco is also,
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:16.660]   the Bay Area is also the hub historically
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:20.180]   of some of the greatest innovation in human history.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.020]   - Yeah.
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:22.040]   - So there's that tension.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.380]   How did that culture emerge there,
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:27.340]   where like the innovation was done by people
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:29.000]   that are very mission-driven.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.800]   You get a bunch of smart people together
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:32.640]   to solve a difficult problem.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.660]   They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on,
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:37.580]   but they try to balance that
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:41.420]   'cause it requires that focus to solve an actual problem.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.700]   And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:47.300]   It's a fascinating human dynamic.
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:48.140]   I don't know.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:52.380]   Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley,
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.240]   not just the innovation,
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.180]   but the social dynamics that occurred there.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.180]   Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:01.700]   - Well, because people don't wanna get attacked.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.100]   It's like super, you don't wanna get canceled, right?
[01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:07.660]   It's super uncomfortable.
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.980]   Nobody wants to be called a racist
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:11.940]   or whatever people wanna say on Twitter.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:14.540]   - To get attacked?
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:15.980]   - Yeah, yeah, I definitely got attacked.
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.940]   I mean, and I knew it would be controversial.
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.580]   The only reason I did it, frankly,
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.540]   was that I was kind of at my wits end.
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.740]   I was like, well, like I said earlier,
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:26.420]   like the job, the CEO job sucks.
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:29.420]   Like either I don't wanna do it or they have to go
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:31.280]   and I'm gonna make the company into something that I want.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.280]   And I'd spent eight or nine years in my life at that point
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.300]   kind of building this thing.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.140]   I was like, well, I could go start another company,
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.180]   but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things.
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:43.500]   And Coinbase is a very rare thing
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:44.380]   that happened in the world.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.180]   I feel very passionate about it.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.780]   So yeah, I'm not gonna go.
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.980]   Like I need to make this the company that I wanna work at.
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.020]   And what was really interesting
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:56.740]   was that there was such a huge outpouring of support.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:58.180]   So I knew that it would be controversial
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:59.020]   and I would get attacked.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.940]   And predictably, there was some journalists
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:04.460]   and New York Times and all these people
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.780]   who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:09.420]   on the company shortly thereafter.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:12.060]   And they basically just call people who've left the company
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.620]   and can get quotes on whatever they want
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:16.260]   and then they'll write a story.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.540]   So mainstream media,
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.220]   I lost a lot of trust in mainstream media,
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.060]   frankly, after that.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.640]   And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.900]   that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.740]   at this point.
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.500]   It's basically either super left or super right.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.980]   And it's not really that focused on truth.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:35.500]   So that's kind of unfortunate
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.820]   'cause I think journalism is actually like
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:37.900]   really important in society.
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:40.740]   So that whole thing got eroded in the US.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.340]   Luckily, there's sort of new media, people like you
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:44.660]   and a whole bunch of people.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.620]   - Did that blog post help that statement,
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:50.540]   the 95 people that remained,
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.500]   is this still something you struggle with?
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:56.580]   Because it's also a culture of the broader tech space.
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.980]   - Okay, so that was an interesting thing,
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.620]   which was that, so the 95% of people stayed.
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:04.940]   I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said,
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.200]   "Thank God you finally spoke up and said something."
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.860]   Because frankly, it was making it not a very fun place
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:12.280]   to work either.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.220]   And I realized that there is,
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.700]   I think there was a, I think Nassim Taleb
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:21.300]   has this blog post about the tyranny of the 1%
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.340]   or something like that.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.020]   But there's basically a relatively small group,
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:25.500]   one in 5% or something like that,
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.340]   that is really upset about something.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.820]   It's not the majority of the company, it's like 5%.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.380]   There's another 15% or something
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:34.180]   that are sympathetic to the cause.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:35.940]   They're actually somewhat suggestible.
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:37.520]   They will go along with whatever,
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.680]   because it sounds reasonable.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.360]   These are like real issues they're talking about.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.620]   It's not to say that it's not real.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.900]   And they'll kind of get swept up in it.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:48.460]   But there's an 80% of the company that basically
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.360]   doesn't agree or just wants to get their work done
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.880]   without all this drama or distraction.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:56.600]   And they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up,
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.740]   they're afraid of being, again, called a racist,
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.920]   like fired, ostracized amongst their peers.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.600]   And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.760]   for me to finally say, you know what,
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.080]   I just, I feel like I have to do this.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.560]   Live through the short-term attacks of the press,
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.300]   which ultimately was very freeing for me
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.320]   because now I don't really care.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.060]   And now I can actually just build the company
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:20.720]   that I want to build without caring about that.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.160]   So, and then what was cool was a lot of really great people
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.940]   reached out to the Coinbase too after that.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:29.700]   And were like, I'm an early engineer at Google or whatever.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.000]   And like this culture has gotten kind of messed up
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.200]   and like, I want to work at a company
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.240]   that's willing to stand for that.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.360]   And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.880]   Basically what I realized, and by the way,
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:40.360]   our diversity numbers and all that stuff,
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.400]   like people told me when I was drafting this post,
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.400]   they're like, don't post this.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.240]   You're like, people, underrepresented groups
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.840]   will never want to work at this company again.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.740]   I was like, I don't think that's true.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.680]   Like I talked to like our ERG groups
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.720]   and they're not telling me they care
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.840]   about this stuff that much.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.800]   They're telling me they just want to like be respected
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.840]   at work and do good work and contribute.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.620]   So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.820]   And like, I can tell you a year after doing it,
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.540]   like our diversity numbers are basically
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.840]   either the same or better in every category.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.380]   So that turned out to be false.
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:15.420]   Look, I hate to be like, you know,
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:17.240]   polarizing on in either dimension here.
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.540]   Like I just want to get good work done
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:19.980]   and build good stuff with technology.
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.800]   So, you know, I think companies should just have
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.580]   like reasonable policies.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:27.300]   Like you want to get rid of bias in hiring.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.660]   You want to attract great people
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:30.600]   from all different backgrounds.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.860]   Like, you know, we have pledge 1%.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.980]   We put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.820]   Like I hope we're able to do good stuff with that.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.120]   That's, you know, give back in some way.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.700]   But like the main message, I guess for me is like
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:47.460]   the core mission, the core work that we're doing
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.980]   on economic freedom and just all of our products,
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:51.300]   that is like the main value
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.340]   that we're contributing in the world.
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.520]   Like, let's just do that more.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.580]   And hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users
[01:57:56.580 --> 01:57:58.140]   to a billion or whatever.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:01.240]   And then I just think that's how we'll have
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:02.280]   the biggest impact.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.460]   - It's tempting though.
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.820]   It's so interesting how companies get tempted to help.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:07.660]   - Yeah.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:10.180]   - It's like, and you step in and it's almost like a drug
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:11.940]   and then you can't, you forget.
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:13.780]   I mean, like all of us in life,
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.260]   it doesn't have to be companies, you get distracted.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.100]   - Yeah.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.780]   - And maintaining focus, like you're absolutely right.
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:22.100]   The way for Coinbase to add value to the world
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:25.180]   is to maximize the mission that it's on,
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.340]   not other stuff.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.220]   And when you get wealthier and more successful,
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.940]   there's, it becomes more and more tempting
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:34.260]   to just help out in some other shallow ways.
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:35.900]   And it's fascinating.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.540]   And you just kind of brought that to light.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.740]   So it was very refreshing
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.260]   and it shouldn't be controversial
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:43.980]   to sort of focus on just getting stuff done.
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:46.220]   - Well, let me ask you, I mean, do you think that this,
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:47.660]   it's all these things tie together.
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:50.140]   There's like a general trend of like more censorship,
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.020]   you know, there's like more cancel culture.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:57.300]   There's some of these like freedom values
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:00.660]   are kind of, you know, even like freezing people's accounts,
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:02.460]   like the trucker thing that happened.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.060]   And it seems like there's a general trend
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:10.060]   of more authoritarian, you know, policies there.
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.460]   But do you think that,
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.900]   do you feel like the tide is turning on that?
[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:16.340]   Like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently.
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:19.340]   - Yeah, I think it's the last gasp
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:20.900]   of old way of doing things.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.900]   And so there's desperation and so on.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:27.100]   'Cause to be fair, it's kind of the internet,
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.660]   which is where's the source of a lot of this,
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.180]   where people have a voice,
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:34.300]   is making the power centers of the world really nervous.
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.540]   And so that's where that's coming from, I think.
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:38.780]   And the internet is tricky.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:39.980]   It's weird.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.660]   It's full of bots.
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:45.780]   It's full of like misinformation of all kinds,
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:49.820]   full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:51.580]   And I mean, misinformation broadly,
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:53.780]   people are misusing the word misinformation.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:56.780]   They're just, governments are just labeling random things
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:59.040]   with misinformation just to censor them.
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:03.540]   But I just think it's just like a new world
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:06.100]   where the internet is really finally taking hold,
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:09.260]   where there's billions of devices and everybody has a voice.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:14.260]   It's almost, basically governments and powerful people
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:18.400]   are slightly losing hold of power
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.540]   and they're starting to freak out a little bit.
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:21.420]   That's it.
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:23.900]   And so, and then once you have young people
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:25.620]   that are coming up now,
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:28.700]   gain power, I think will rebalance everything.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.540]   And then there's, yeah, like you said, promising signs
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:38.220]   that it's obvious that the majority of people want freedom.
[02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:39.460]   And that means a lot of things.
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:40.660]   That means economic freedom.
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:43.040]   That means freedom to have a voice,
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.660]   freedom to move around,
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.980]   freedom to act in the way they,
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.980]   without reasonable sort of limitations
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:55.020]   by people that don't have their best interests.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:59.700]   And I gain more hope from just regular people
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:04.340]   that are fighting and like demanding
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:08.620]   being able to have freedom of speech,
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:13.380]   or more specifically sort of resisting crude
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:16.460]   overreach of government in the acts of censorship,
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:18.020]   at least in the United States.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:22.660]   And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:25.340]   that's struggling on a much more basic level
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:26.780]   where people are being put in prison
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:30.060]   for the words they say, not just banned from Twitter.
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.500]   - Right, could be worse.
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:35.900]   - What are some lessons from your failures
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:40.100]   and your successes about what it takes to run a company?
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.980]   - I think one of the things that I've learned
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:44.640]   about leadership is that,
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.260]   I never really thought of myself
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:48.860]   as a very natural leader, to be honest.
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.580]   I don't think I was a natural leader.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:54.060]   But so I always envisioned good leaders
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.500]   as like these military generals,
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.540]   like they seem so confident
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.980]   and they're just like bark orders,
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:00.380]   charge that hill and do this.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:03.260]   And I was actually like more introverted
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.740]   and kind of, I wasn't really confident
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.060]   in the way I communicated.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:11.940]   And so what I realized is that
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.140]   there's lots of different kinds of leaders.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.020]   You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:18.180]   I was kind of more of like a product technical focus CEO.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.740]   And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.780]   And it wasn't just gonna like render a decision in the room
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:25.100]   in some like kind of heated moment
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:26.260]   and like piss off half the people.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.380]   I would be like, all right, I'm gonna go think about it
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:30.660]   and I'll send you my decision later today
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:32.140]   or tomorrow or whatever.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:35.020]   And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:38.600]   where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like,
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.580]   when people getting like super emotional about something
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:44.540]   and like, I think they're thinking
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.460]   their judgment goes down, right?
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:48.500]   And it's like never make a decision when you're angry.
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.980]   And so if I would always sort of try to get a sense of,
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:52.260]   are these people like trying to be right
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:54.660]   or are they trying to seek the truth?
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:57.260]   And you can do these little tricks like,
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:59.380]   okay, you argue that person's position
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:00.380]   and you argue the other one
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.820]   and like see if you can genuinely represent it.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:05.380]   Now I know you're listening and these kinds of things.
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:07.140]   But I guess, sorry,
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:08.540]   getting back to your question about leadership.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:12.180]   I think I basically just kept doing things
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:15.140]   that were a little outside my comfort zone
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.780]   and then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.620]   You know?
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:22.060]   And so I think that's how you build confidence
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:24.940]   is you do the thing that's scary
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.820]   and it's like a little outside.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:29.100]   And like when I first started Coinbase,
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:30.220]   I had never managed anybody.
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:32.060]   I would have been scared to death
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:34.660]   to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:38.180]   and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go,
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.300]   you know, we didn't know what percent it was gonna be
[02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:41.380]   by the way, it could have been 1%, it could have been 50%.
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:44.100]   Like, but we went into it scary
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:45.220]   because it was a scary thing.
[02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:47.540]   I was like, I don't know, I think this is right.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.420]   I'm just gonna do it.
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:50.940]   So if you do enough scary things,
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:52.820]   like you'll build the confidence.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:54.540]   And I feel like I'm still on that journey.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:57.060]   Every year or two at Coinbase,
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.420]   there's some big thing that comes out.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.620]   It's like, oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.580]   and like this is the next level, right?
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:05.580]   But that's how you learn and grow.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:07.540]   - So you're still going up that mountain
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.340]   through the fog one step at a time.
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:10.580]   - Yeah.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:13.980]   - Can I just quickly ask you about a couple other efforts
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:15.860]   that are super interesting that you're involved with?
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.900]   So first of all, a little bit more old school,
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.660]   fascinating effort of Research Hub.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.300]   So what's that about?
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:26.980]   The GitHub for open science.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:28.740]   - Yeah, okay, so basically I've had a chance
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.100]   to try to help a couple other companies
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:30.940]   get off the ground too
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:34.620]   'cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.340]   And one of them, I've always thought about like,
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:41.300]   why is scientific research not more like open source software
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:42.700]   or why couldn't it be much faster, right?
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:44.780]   And you've probably have seen this
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:46.020]   like in an academic setting, right?
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.700]   But there's all kinds of things
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:50.500]   that feel very antiquated to me about scientific research.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:53.740]   Everything from the funding process and grants
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:57.620]   to how peer review works, to how you submit to journals,
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:59.580]   all the costs associated with journals,
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:02.580]   the people you'd think like you'd get paid for this
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:03.820]   or something and it would then be available
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:05.140]   to all the taxpayers for free,
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:06.700]   but no, they're like, they're all paywalled
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:09.380]   and there's like these big companies that have sort of,
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:12.020]   in my view, kind of held back innovation here.
[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:14.980]   So, and the preprint servers like bioRxiv
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:16.580]   and archive.org have really helped this,
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:18.580]   but those websites, they look like they're kind of
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:20.380]   from like 15 years ago or something.
[02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:21.780]   - Yeah, it's like Craigslist or something.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.780]   - Yeah, so anyway, one of the things I,
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.340]   once Coinbase went public last year,
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:27.580]   I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like,
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:28.900]   all right, let me find a small team
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:31.580]   and let's see if they can like go off
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:32.700]   and make something better here.
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:35.140]   So we have a prototype out there.
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:36.300]   It's at researchhub.com.
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:37.380]   People can check it out.
[02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:39.700]   And it's basically, you know,
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:41.540]   the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.500]   There's like various hubs, which are like journals,
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.460]   but you know, you can publish papers there.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:48.260]   You can use an electronic lab notebook
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.740]   to sort of have a modern day paper,
[02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:51.580]   which is not just a PDF that's static,
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:53.580]   but it's a living document.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:54.460]   Ideally in the future, you know,
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.580]   you can get comments and feedback from people in there.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:57.980]   You can update it over time.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.180]   We want people to be able to share the code
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.660]   and the datasets associated with their research paper
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:05.020]   is not just a PDF.
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:07.020]   In the future, we want to make it even where like,
[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:09.860]   you know, people can get funding for science
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:13.660]   through that site and even license out innovations
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:14.500]   that they've made.
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.380]   'Cause the other thing I've noticed in life
[02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:17.940]   is that there's kind of like,
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:19.220]   there's a bunch of people working on science
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:21.100]   and there's a bunch of people building companies
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.340]   and they very rarely intersect,
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:25.140]   but when they do, you get the best things
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:28.020]   like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google.
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:31.020]   And like even Coinbase was based on a research paper,
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:32.460]   the Bitcoin white paper.
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:34.900]   And so most business people are like creating
[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:36.780]   companies that don't have any scientific innovation.
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:40.220]   They're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:42.740]   And then a lot of scientists are making things
[02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:44.740]   which never actually benefit humanity
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:47.540]   'cause they're not commercialized and turned into products.
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:50.660]   And so if we can somehow create a translation layer
[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:53.300]   between those two groups and help them,
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:56.260]   you know, helps align the market forces,
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.100]   align scientific research to market forces
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:06:59.140]   so that they're more incentivized.
[02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:01.740]   Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that,
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:03.220]   like you should be a billionaire, you know,
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:05.540]   and like all the downstream implications of that,
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.860]   not going through some antiquated tech transfer office
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:08.700]   or whatever.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:11.180]   And if you're an entrepreneur,
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.580]   you should be looking to commercialize
[02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:14.780]   the latest scientific innovations.
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:17.060]   And so that's kind of like the long-term vision
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:18.700]   for that site.
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:20.220]   I think it's just an early step today,
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:22.580]   but we've got like a really passionate community on there
[02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:24.820]   that are jumping into like, you know,
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:29.740]   computer science or longevity or various bio hubs
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:31.820]   or whatever, and like beginning to source
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:34.220]   the best innovations, but also discuss them,
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:36.260]   improve them, and publish through the site.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:38.260]   - So I have a question about incentives,
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.980]   but first let me say for people listening
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.700]   that are outside of academia might not be familiar
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:44.300]   with an absurd situation.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:47.260]   So there's journals, like you mentioned,
[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:51.640]   and scientists publishing those journals,
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:56.340]   and the journals provide very little value
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:00.660]   except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.
[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:05.540]   And so in the digital world,
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:07.460]   they're providing basically almost no value
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.040]   except hosting your paper.
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:15.300]   And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.500]   And that charge is not like even Netflix fees.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.900]   You're talking about a lot of money.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:24.060]   So they're basically blocking your research
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:27.060]   that should be wide open from the world
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:28.420]   and creating a paywall.
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:30.620]   It's a fascinating like scam
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.300]   that's actually holding back.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:37.300]   It's a shitty scam 'cause you're not making that much money.
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:38.780]   I feel like a definition of a scam,
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:40.780]   you should at least be making money,
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.140]   so like significant amount of money.
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:44.420]   You're basically making shady money
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.860]   and holding back all of human knowledge, okay?
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:49.220]   So that put aside, and people get a little confused
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:53.420]   because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists.
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:55.820]   People think like the journals are somehow
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.960]   funding the scientists, therefore they have the right
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:01.140]   to put up a paywall.
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:03.460]   No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere.
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.040]   Journals are the middleman that nobody asks for,
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.220]   especially in the digital world.
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:13.220]   Anyway, that said, there is a interesting kind of incentives
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:16.100]   for scientists, which is prestige and so on.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:20.060]   So there's a thing with journals.
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:22.300]   If there's a prestigious journal
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:25.180]   and you pass the review process,
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.660]   you get into that journal,
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:29.780]   or a prestigious conference in computer science,
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:33.460]   then that's seen as a good thing on your resume.
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:36.100]   And not just your resume, within your community,
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:37.400]   that's a respected thing.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.700]   Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:44.760]   in the open setting of Research Hub?
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.500]   So like where I could say, I got X, Y, and Z.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.820]   Like look, I'm impressive
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:52.700]   because this happened on Research Hub.
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:53.540]   - I think you're right.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:56.920]   Like the whole academia progress track
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.900]   is about where you got published
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:09:59.860]   and how many citations.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:04.300]   And it's kind of like a false economy of reputation
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:06.940]   because there's not real money backing it.
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:10.260]   And so I think we've thought about this a little bit,
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.220]   and I think the Research Hub team has an opportunity
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:14.900]   to do something here that basically says like,
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.900]   okay, I had the top paper for 2022 in biology in here.
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:23.220]   And you basically publish a list,
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.060]   a leaderboards of these,
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:27.600]   like the top for the month, the year,
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:29.180]   in all these different categories.
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:33.140]   Then actually, we should probably give out grants and awards
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.500]   in addition to that.
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.340]   Fund those people almost like fellows
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:40.100]   or even give out like, you know how like the Nobel Prize,
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:42.080]   there should be like a Research Hub Prize or something
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.940]   and like ship people,
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:47.740]   maybe even ship like a print version of a journal
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:50.260]   that is the top papers in each category
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.260]   in each month or whatever.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:53.820]   And like people wanna put that in their wall in the lab.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:57.600]   And like, so I do think we need to sort of change,
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.000]   I don't know, like the traditional folks in academia
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.560]   or science would probably think this is like crazy idea,
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:04.580]   but I think we need to change the culture
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:09.360]   to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals,
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:11.400]   almost like friends don't let friends publish
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.160]   in like paywall journals,
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.480]   like 'cause that's, it's just not helping humanity.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:19.080]   So like, you know, it should be more prestigious
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.940]   to publish in an open science way and get the top spot.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:25.740]   That should be celebrated above being published
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:27.780]   in whatever, I don't even wanna name one of them, you know?
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:30.100]   - Well, there's currently,
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:31.300]   the culture has already shifted
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.660]   to where almost everybody publishes on archive
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:34.900]   and by archive and so on.
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:36.100]   - Yeah.
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:39.060]   - But so that the culture is there on that,
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:42.400]   that scene friends don't let friends not publish open,
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.700]   but then the prestige thing is missing,
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.860]   which is like anyone can publish an archive.
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:48.700]   - Yeah.
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.020]   - That's actually a strong paper.
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:55.020]   Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now,
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:56.540]   word of mouth is powerful.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:00.220]   Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:02.660]   So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper.
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.060]   We don't need reviewers.
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.140]   Our human eyes are the reviewers,
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.500]   like the community is the reviewers.
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:11.020]   So it's already, like that part is there,
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:16.020]   but it would be nice to have like, you know, nature level,
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:21.020]   like this is respect, this is a respectful accomplishment.
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:21.860]   - Yeah.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:23.740]   - And something like a leaderboard,
[02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:25.940]   but a stable kind of system.
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:27.620]   - Yeah, and I should mention too,
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:29.060]   so there's a crypto angle to this too,
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:31.100]   which is, so Research Hub has a coin
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:32.540]   associated with Research Coin.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:34.380]   And it's basically if people, you know,
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.060]   upvote your paper or like support it,
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.940]   you'll accumulate more Research Coin,
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:42.140]   which is basically like rep or like a reward token.
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:45.300]   And so that is a way to, I guess,
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:49.460]   measure the community's collective view of that paper,
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.140]   a form of peer review.
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:53.100]   And it can even be weighted by like the reputation
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:54.140]   of the people voting on it
[02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:55.780]   and that sort of thing over time.
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:59.460]   Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that,
[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.380]   so I think from a prestige point of view,
[02:13:02.380 --> 02:13:05.060]   it won't start off that way.
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.380]   It'll probably start off like being a little more quirky.
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:10.100]   Like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started,
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:13.260]   it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff.
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:14.420]   And, but now like, you know,
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.020]   if you have a million subscribers on YouTube,
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:18.460]   that's probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.020]   or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:23.460]   So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever,
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:27.140]   but I'm hoping that this can sort of be the new
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:30.060]   prestigious way that young people publish in science
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.500]   and it'll become to be viewed as more prestigious.
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:34.100]   The journals, the traditional journals
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:36.020]   will be viewed as old fashioned.
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:39.460]   - Well, it's definitely a system
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:41.440]   that could do a lot better.
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.380]   And there's a lot of incredible, brilliant people
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:44.620]   doing science.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.500]   They deserve better, the better platforms.
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:50.260]   So another thing you're taking on and helping out with
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:53.820]   is this new limit, which is looking at longevity.
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.660]   What's the idea there?
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:58.060]   - Yeah, okay, so as you can see, I'm excited about science.
[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.120]   Like I think, you know, science is sort of the,
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.300]   basically if you get scientific innovation,
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:05.640]   then you get better products
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:07.100]   and you get better economic growth.
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.300]   And then you get all kinds of like surplus in society
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:12.500]   that can go to arts and philosophy
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:13.340]   and like all kinds of stuff.
[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:17.700]   But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got excited.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:21.080]   I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.620]   and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:24.620]   happening in bio.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.740]   And there's a lot of really cool stuff happening
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:28.900]   with like CAR T cells and CRISPR and all these things.
[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:32.740]   And anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.100]   was something called cell reprogramming.
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.680]   And, you know, people maybe have heard of this
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.980]   induced pluripotent stem cells,
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:41.380]   where you could take like a skin cell
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:43.220]   and turn it back into a stem cell.
[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:46.860]   And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for this work
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:48.980]   that was done in 2006.
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.740]   And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.260]   You can turn one cell into another type of cell.
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:57.980]   Well, people recently have been experimenting
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.260]   with different types of transcription factors
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:02.860]   that would either not,
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.100]   you don't want a cell to go all the way back
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:05.560]   to being a stem cell.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.300]   You can end up getting like cancerous cells
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:08.120]   and things like that.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.500]   But you want it basically to the cell to revert
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:13.380]   a little bit earlier in its, you know,
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:15.020]   it would call it the Waddington landscape,
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:16.620]   but it's basically like,
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:19.700]   it'll start to act like a bit of a younger cell,
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.860]   but not to de-differentiate and become
[02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:23.180]   more like a stem cell.
[02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:25.760]   And so I decided this might be an interesting area
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.020]   to go fund.
[02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:28.780]   I think that that team has come together.
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:30.900]   There's like some really talented people
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:32.560]   who've come together to help get that off the ground.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.080]   And they're basically building a platform
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.820]   that can test a lot of different transcription factors
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:39.840]   on different cell types,
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.620]   and hopefully find ways to rejuvenate
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:44.380]   different types of cells and tissues
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:45.520]   to extend human health span.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.760]   I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know,
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.700]   the get to Mars is that there could be some therapy here
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:54.260]   that in, I don't know, 10 or 20 years that you take
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.580]   and from a whole body point of view
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:58.340]   is sort of rejuvenating tissue,
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.740]   not just one type of tissue like your immune system,
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:02.560]   but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain,
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.900]   so that, you know, we don't have that issue
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.520]   where people who are older have trouble learning
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.620]   or they're more ossified in their thinking.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:12.200]   To me, this is just, I always think about,
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.540]   you know, it's actually a little inspired by Elon, right?
[02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:18.060]   Is like, what are some of the biggest things in the world
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:20.520]   like that are probably high technology risk,
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.540]   but if they did work,
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.560]   maybe they're kind of low chance of working,
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:26.020]   but if they did work, would have enormous impact.
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.380]   I like the idea of trying hard tech problems,
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.880]   especially for people like founders like me
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:32.460]   who've made some money in software,
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:34.700]   which I think we're in kind of like a golden age of software
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:36.540]   so there's like fortunes to be made.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.700]   But if you do make some money in that,
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:42.700]   my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits, you know,
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:45.020]   and try some of the harder things like in biotech
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:48.460]   or, you know, I guess he's doing cars and rockets and stuff,
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:52.500]   but anyway, I think we should try hard tech
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:54.660]   or, you know, physical science problems as well
[02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:58.140]   and see if that can advance for Team Human.
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:02.540]   - Yeah, so he's also doing bio with Neuralink
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:07.300]   and I feel like bio is tough 'cause it's messy.
[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.340]   - We don't understand it as well.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.420]   - We don't understand it.
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:14.200]   The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher,
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.220]   but like you have to deal with the actual sort of,
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:23.220]   to get to human, to get to stuff where it could be therapies
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:28.220]   for actual human bodies is tricky
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:30.220]   'cause you have to prove that it's safe, it's effective,
[02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:33.540]   all those kinds of things with FDA.
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:34.900]   I mean, it's just, it's tricky.
[02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:36.140]   It's very difficult.
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:38.500]   It's a long journey.
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.340]   I mean--
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.700]   - If I can give a quick plug.
[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:43.420]   So yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:45.820]   We're hiring talented scientists that are interested
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:47.040]   in the cell reprogramming space.
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.860]   They don't necessarily have to be coming
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.700]   from like an aging background or anything like that.
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:53.100]   There's sort of a small group of people doing even--
[02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:54.220]   - So this is a new thing?
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:56.420]   This is, is New Limit relatively new?
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:57.620]   - Yeah, it's very new.
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.580]   There's a small team today,
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:00.700]   just a handful of people.
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:03.660]   And so we're hiring more there.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:05.580]   If people are excited about that space, reach out.
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:07.940]   And same thing for Research Hub.
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:10.100]   There's a small team there that's really awesome
[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:12.380]   that's doing more like software engineering,
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:15.020]   design, product, that kind of stuff.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.820]   - What advice would you give,
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:21.260]   if you put on your old wise sage hat,
[02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:23.980]   what advice would you give to young people today?
[02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:27.260]   High school, maybe undergrad and college,
[02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:29.580]   about life?
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:34.220]   So like career, having a career they can be proud of,
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.380]   or maybe a life they can be proud of.
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:40.460]   - So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:42.380]   So there's not one way to do it.
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:44.860]   I do think that some people,
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:46.460]   a particular type of people out there,
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:47.300]   a lot of people actually,
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:48.500]   they want to have an impact on the world.
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:50.980]   That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:53.700]   So, I mean, you need to have like health, physical health.
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.020]   You need to have good relationships.
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:56.420]   Like there's lots of things,
[02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:58.420]   but most people want to do something important.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:18:59.700]   They want to have fulfilling work,
[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:01.660]   a way that they can feel like they're contributing.
[02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:04.380]   I think a lot of people, young people today,
[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:07.380]   are thinking like, you know,
[02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:09.540]   I should be an activist or something like that.
[02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:11.460]   And there's people in the world who have power,
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.820]   and a lot of people who don't, I don't have power.
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:16.620]   And so the way to change the world is to, you know,
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:20.420]   speak truth to power or like criticize power
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:24.220]   and try to pressure them to change.
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:27.260]   To me, I don't think that's the right way
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.860]   to actually have an impact on the world,
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:33.700]   because, you know, everybody has probably,
[02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:36.860]   I think people have more power than they realize.
[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:39.500]   And by the way, it's easy to be a critic.
[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:42.220]   It's hard to actually change these things and fix it.
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:45.500]   And so you'll get a lot of accolades from friends
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.620]   and things like that if you kind of go around criticizing.
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:48.580]   You know, it's easy to do.
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:50.900]   Like everything is broken and could be better,
[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:53.420]   including, you know, stuff I'm working on.
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:56.100]   I find like, it's so frustrating.
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:57.700]   There's a million things I want to be better about,
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:19:59.380]   like what we're doing in Coinbase.
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:04.140]   So be the person in the arena, you know,
[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:05.580]   like that Theodore Roosevelt quote,
[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:07.020]   I think he said it right.
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:10.220]   Like, go chew glass and stare into the abyss.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:11.900]   Like, if you really want to have an impact,
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:14.620]   either join a company that has a mission
[02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:16.260]   that is trying to fix the thing you're passionate about,
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:18.980]   or start that company if it doesn't exist,
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:22.300]   or start a charity if it's not suitable to be a company
[02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:25.700]   or whatever it is, but go try to be a part of the solution.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:30.340]   Don't just, you know, criticize or be a part of the problem.
[02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:35.340]   My hope is that more people can, you know,
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:38.780]   realize that they actually can have
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:39.900]   a meaningful impact that way.
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:43.340]   And I think that to me, technology is actually
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:45.500]   one of the most important ways to improve the world.
[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:49.260]   Like if you look at climate change,
[02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:52.020]   like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:53.660]   all these things, it's a technology thing, right?
[02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:56.020]   If you want to try to fix education,
[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:57.460]   it's like look at like Khan Academy
[02:20:57.460 --> 02:20:59.140]   and all the stuff going online, right?
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:02.060]   If you want to fix, you know, whatever,
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:05.100]   transportation and like the financial system
[02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.860]   and global freedom and like equality of all these things,
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:11.300]   like there's typically the way to get something changed
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:13.340]   in the world today is with technology.
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:15.940]   And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:19.260]   that there's this kind of like anti-tech thing going on.
[02:21:19.260 --> 02:21:20.580]   Look, nothing is perfect.
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:22.580]   Like if you create something new and like
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:23.580]   tens of millions of people use it
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.460]   or billions of people use it,
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:26.500]   it's like there's going to be some bad people
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:27.420]   who use it too, okay?
[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:29.540]   And there's, you know, society is complicated,
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:32.020]   but like I think most of these things
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:33.700]   have been net positive because most people
[02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:36.260]   in the world are good, is at least my view.
[02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:39.140]   So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people
[02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:41.020]   trying to, you know, abuse something,
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:42.660]   but 99% of people in the world are good.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:45.060]   And the way you can improve the world is with technology,
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:46.460]   joining companies, starting companies
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:48.260]   that are working on the right stuff.
[02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:50.940]   So I hope more young people do that.
[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:53.580]   And just, if you're not sure what to do,
[02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:54.860]   like just get started with anything.
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:55.780]   That's how you learn.
[02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:57.780]   - And basically have the optimism
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:00.260]   that you have the power to do the change.
[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:05.140]   So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic.
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:08.180]   That's almost like acknowledging to yourself
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:09.600]   that that's all you can be.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:15.300]   But basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:19.820]   - I like chew glass and look into the abyss.
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:24.000]   That's much more fun than it sounds.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.420]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:28.900]   Why are we here?
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:29.980]   - Life.
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:31.740]   - Yep, what's the meaning of life?
[02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:34.140]   What's this existence we got?
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.380]   You're trying to increase the amount of economic freedom
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:38.260]   on this planet Earth, trying to alleviate
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:40.460]   some of the suffering, but why?
[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:44.420]   - I don't really think there is any point to life.
[02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:49.220]   You know, somebody once told me,
[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:51.900]   you know, if you go into these like kind of
[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:54.600]   really big existential questions,
[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.700]   it can get a little scary,
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:58.160]   'cause like you stare off the cliff
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.560]   and there's like, there's nothing there, you know?
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.940]   This one person told me one time, they were like,
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:08.180]   you know, Brian, you should probably snorkel, don't scuba.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:10.680]   I guess, and I think they were trying to say like,
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:13.060]   some of my friends have done this, right?
[02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:16.900]   They'll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:20.260]   and like, they'll kind of come back with all this
[02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:22.220]   existential dread of like, what's the meaning of it all?
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:24.060]   And then like, as far as I can tell,
[02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:27.700]   we are just some organic molecules in the ocean
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:29.980]   started like dividing and replicating
[02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:32.460]   and the selfish gene and all this stuff
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.580]   like basically ended up here.
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:38.060]   And our only, it's some kind of like really naive algorithm
[02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:40.220]   that's just kind of trying to get us to survive
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:43.580]   and replicate and we have DNA just like every other animal.
[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:46.020]   And so we happen to develop these like really cool
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:48.600]   neocortexes and so now we're sort of self-aware
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:50.980]   and we have all these big questions.
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:54.060]   And maybe we'll create another, you know,
[02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:55.020]   as computers get better,
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:57.080]   we'll create the simulation inside our thing.
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.780]   And I think it's cool, like we should basically,
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:02.660]   I just wanna keep watching the movie, you know, unfold.
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:04.900]   That's part of why I wanna work on like,
[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:06.420]   New Limit is really cool 'cause it's helped.
[02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:07.720]   If people can live longer,
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:10.660]   whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:13.220]   or, you know, basically through,
[02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:16.180]   we get biology to work or the strong AI to work
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:18.780]   or whatever, one of those two hopefully works out.
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:20.680]   And then we get to keep watching the movie
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.180]   and see how it all unfolds.
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:23.380]   I think that's fun.
[02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.640]   And so I don't know if that's like an answer,
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.660]   but I guess, I don't think there's any real purpose.
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:28.660]   So just try to have fun.
[02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:32.740]   - Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:34.500]   as we watch it.
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:36.620]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:38.680]   I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote and all that,
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:40.380]   where he's like, "Everything around you was invented
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:42.140]   "by somebody who just was like,
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.580]   "that this was a crazy idea they thought up."
[02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:48.580]   So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want,
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:53.020]   then that's what you start to go,
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:55.120]   you start to go try crazier stuff.
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.720]   I mean, this is another one of those areas where,
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:59.080]   not to get too out there, but like, you know,
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.060]   when you're, I think you can build your comfort zone
[02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:03.980]   around like people being upset with you.
[02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:06.940]   You can also build your range
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:08.180]   of what you think is possible, right?
[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:10.500]   Like when I was in my 20s,
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:12.180]   I was like reading all these books
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:13.860]   about like self-improvement and goal,
[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:15.080]   how to write down your goals and stuff.
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:17.900]   And my goals were like,
[02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:21.380]   "Someday I wanna make $100,000 a year,"
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:23.340]   or something like, and that was,
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:27.700]   and, you know, and it seemed like a little outlandish
[02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:28.980]   or what, and I wrote down these goals,
[02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:31.700]   like I wanna own rental property or something, anyway.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:35.140]   And then I slowly started to get some of these things done
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:35.960]   over a couple of years.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.460]   And so I started to think a little bigger.
[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:41.060]   I remember one time I wrote down this goal where I was like,
[02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:42.940]   what's the craziest thing I could think of?
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:44.620]   I was like, "What if I wanna write,
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:47.300]   "I wanna start a billion dollar tech company."
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:48.220]   That's crazy.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:50.940]   And I had never started like a million dollar tech company
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:52.220]   or any tech company really.
[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:54.980]   So what business did I have writing that goal down?
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:57.460]   I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper,
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:01.620]   like probably every day for a year or something, almost.
[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:02.540]   I don't know if it was every day,
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:03.700]   but like I wrote it down a lot.
[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:06.660]   And so little things started to happen.
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:08.460]   I was like, "All right, well, maybe I should move back
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:09.960]   "to the Bay Area from Buenos Aires.
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:13.060]   "Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever."
[02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:15.260]   Like, and I started thinking about these ideas.
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:16.940]   And so whatever gets you fired up,
[02:26:16.940 --> 02:26:18.780]   it doesn't have to be like some company goal
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:21.620]   or startup thing, it could be anything, right?
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:22.620]   Maybe you wanna publish a book
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:25.140]   or like do something creatively or whatever.
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:30.140]   Anyway, you know, I think like within seven years,
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:33.260]   no, it's probably more like 10 years
[02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:34.780]   of me writing that goal down,
[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:38.780]   Coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars.
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:42.860]   So it was out of my realm of what was even possible.
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.620]   And then within 10 years,
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.640]   you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think,
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.460]   less in a year than you think.
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:51.580]   So now I'm like, "Okay, what's the next goal?
[02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:55.520]   "What's the crazy, okay, maybe I wanna get a billion people
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.460]   "accessing the open financial system
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:26:59.620]   "through our products every day."
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:01.660]   You know, that would be cool for humanity.
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:03.460]   And that's a pretty crazy goal.
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:05.060]   Like it's only 8 billion people or something, right?
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:06.260]   So the one out of eight.
[02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:09.700]   Or maybe I can radically,
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:11.980]   like if I make some like the right investments
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:14.860]   or whatever, I can like help radically extend
[02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:17.360]   human health span or whatever, right?
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:21.220]   So try crazier stuff.
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.480]   I don't know, even if it doesn't work,
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:27.480]   like hopefully you'll advance the state of affairs,
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:29.060]   like something interesting will happen.
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.100]   And so most people today,
[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:33.380]   they look at people trying this stuff and they're like,
[02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:35.300]   "Oh my God, they're so, they're a genius."
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:38.540]   Or they're an idiot, like one of the two.
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:39.540]   Neither one are true.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:41.980]   It's just like anybody can start
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:45.180]   by thinking about what they want and then like go for it.
[02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:46.340]   And then once you get that,
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:47.460]   like go for something a little bigger
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:48.860]   and like you just have fun with it.
[02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:51.700]   - And the universe is a way of smiling
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:55.220]   and helping you out if you just write it down
[02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:57.100]   and you dream big.
[02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:59.820]   There's something about just karma,
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:02.980]   about the energy you put into this world.
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.260]   Other people will help you out, doors will open.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.460]   You'll notice that the doors opened
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:10.580]   and you could actually have a shot at making it happen.
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:12.260]   It's a funny world.
[02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:14.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't really subscribe
[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:16.020]   to all like the woo-woo interpretations of this,
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.340]   but my very rational brain interpretation of it
[02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:20.180]   is that if you just wake up every day
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:22.140]   and write down like what you want to get done
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:24.380]   and towards your longer goals, your larger goals,
[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.540]   it's just on your mind that day.
[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:28.020]   So you start to notice opportunities
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:29.340]   and you think about it more.
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:32.060]   - So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:33.420]   Thank you for doing what you're doing,
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:35.620]   doing incredible engineering at scale,
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:39.580]   trying to help out people from all over the world
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:43.340]   and actually helping me personally get more into crypto
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:44.660]   (laughs)
[02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:46.340]   just 'cause it's so easy.
[02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:48.020]   So thank you so much.
[02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:49.580]   And thank you so much
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:51.900]   for giving your extremely valuable time today
[02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:53.300]   to this awesome conversation.
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:55.020]   - Thanks for your awesome podcast.

[02:28:57.540 --> 02:28:58.980]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:00.500]   with Brian Armstrong.
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:01.700]   To support this podcast,

[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.180]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:08.300]   from Benjamin Franklin.
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:12.980]   "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."
[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:15.900]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.500]   (upbeat music)
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:21.100]   (upbeat music)
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:31.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
