[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540]   AI assistants are now doing the work of 700 full time agents at
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.700]   Corona. They moved issue resolving times from 11 minutes
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.840]   with humans to two minutes with AI. And so far, their AI has had
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.940]   2.3 million conversations accounting for two thirds of
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.700]   corners, customer support chats, its AI agent will drive wait for
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.000]   it a $40 million increase in profits this year. This is one
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160]   of the first few times where you're seeing something in
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.660]   production where there's measurable economic value. And
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.100]   the important thing to note about that is that it's not just
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.400]   what it means for Klarna, but what it means for everybody
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.700]   else. So if you look at everybody else, for example,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600]   here's Teleperformance, which is a French company that runs call
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.500]   centers, they lost $1.7 billion of market cap when that tweak
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.100]   went up about 20% of their market cap. This is the real
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.860]   practical implication. Yes, Klarna replaced 700 people, and
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.900]   they say 40 million of OpEx, but Teleperformance while they were
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.400]   just doing their everyday work lost 1.8 billion of their market
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.080]   cap at the exact same moment.
