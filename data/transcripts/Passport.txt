[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Cindy from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.880]   And in this episode, we want to do a catch up and talk about your trip to Japan, when
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   things go wrong, what do we do, where you're at now.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   And also I do want to talk about what people expect to have to need in retirement versus
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.480]   actually what they have, because this conundrum is huge and the gap between what they have
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.160]   and what they expect to have and what they have at various ages has not really changed.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.640]   The gap has continued to remain really wide.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.800]   So first of all, Cindy, how are you feeling about your trip to Japan?
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.120]   I haven't gone yet.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.640]   It's just getting closer.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.480]   I wrote a post a couple of months ago that we published earlier in the month, this month,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.920]   about this big passport debacle that I had.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.440]   Just to summarize, my mom is trying to work through some estate issues with her late sister
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.040]   that I basically became project manager of because my mom didn't know what to do.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   And anyway, we planned a trip to go to Japan after my mom figured out that she wasn't able
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.000]   to go alone.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.840]   And after I booked my flights, I realized that I couldn't find my passport because I
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.200]   needed to give your passport number and all this stuff.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.800]   And I was like, "Wait a minute, where did it go?"
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   And I was looking for it.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.600]   I searched the house and then I started to have a panic attack that I couldn't find it
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.840]   because I'd recently renewed it over the winter and it just didn't make any sense.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.360]   And then I started to have this sinking feeling that I accidentally could have thrown it away
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.400]   inside those priority mail envelopes that they typically come in.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   Why would you do that?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.480]   Why would I do that because I've got too many things going on in my head and made a careless
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   mistake?
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.840]   Either that or maybe one of the many workers that was coming through our house over the
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.560]   winter may have seen it when I wasn't in the room.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   If they were poking around, we had a lot of people coming in and out doing some repairs.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.660]   Maybe it got stolen.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.840]   At the end of the day, I don't know what happened to it, but it was gone.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.080]   So I had to figure out a replacement plan.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.000]   And passport applications and renewals have shot up after COVID kind of died down and
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.480]   people are ready to travel.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   They want to go abroad, get out there and have these adventures.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.800]   And so the wait times, the processing time for passports is slow.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.840]   And I realized I couldn't get an appointment to get my passport replaced because when you
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.080]   lose it or it's stolen, basically you have to start all over as if you're getting one
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.860]   for the first time.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.400]   So I was facing all these roadblocks, couldn't get an appointment, had to figure out what
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   I could do.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.840]   In the end, I got it done, but it was one heck of a stressful experience.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.920]   And how did you get it done though?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.600]   Just give us like three steps.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.520]   What did you do to get it in time to make it for this trip?
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.280]   Well, there weren't any available appointments in San Francisco for the next two months when
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   I was looking and I needed to get it done ASAP.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.880]   The soonest appointment I found was in Marin County somewhere, but that appointment was
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.720]   still three weeks out from the date I needed to start getting my application in and that
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.700]   wasn't going to really work either.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.760]   So I was calling around, talking to as many people as I could and I found out that the
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.000]   San Francisco main post office does take walk-in appointments.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.640]   But because of demand, they told me people start lining up as early as 5am, if not earlier,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.000]   to get one of the few available walk-in appointment slots because they have already scheduled
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.960]   appointments at that location.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.560]   So they're trying to have a few available walk-in slots that they can put in between
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.080]   all the scheduled ones.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.720]   And I don't know, so much was going on and I was like, "How am I going to do this?"
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.040]   There's the kids at home.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.200]   The kids at home, you do your work in the morning.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.000]   What was the easiest way to make this work with the least amount of disruption to our
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   daily day-to-day routines and whatnot?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.160]   So I got an idea late one night.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.360]   I was like, "You know what?
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   TaskRabbit."
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   And what is TaskRabbit?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:46.840]   TaskRabbit is a company that people can join as freelancers to do all kinds of things to
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.760]   earn money themselves through gig work.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.960]   And some examples are moving furniture for people, packing people's things, being a personal
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.880]   assistant, buying groceries, running errands, and waiting in line.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.240]   That sounds crazy to a lot of people, but in my situation, hey, I was fortunate to have
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   the means to be able to hire someone to wait in line outside in the cold early in the morning
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.440]   when I'm normally not awake.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.120]   I'm at home waiting to take care of the kids first thing.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   I thought, "Hey, this could be a great idea."
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.280]   So I ended up hiring an experienced tasker who waits in line for all kinds of things
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.000]   for various people throughout San Francisco.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.080]   And he was able to get there early enough to secure me a spot.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.360]   I got there to meet him as soon as we got the kids taken care of in the morning and
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   took his place in line, got my application in, and it got shipped off to DC that day.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.400]   And then my application was in the system.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.440]   So I was able to get it processed in time before my trip, which is coming up this week.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.880]   Well, I'm glad you got the trip done.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   It looks like it cost $134 for two and a half hours.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.240]   So that includes tip.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.640]   So about, I don't know, it sounds like it's like 40, $45 an hour plus tip.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.760]   And in the end, it seemed like it was worth it because it bought you a position in line
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.020]   and it saved us money and we were able to get things done.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.080]   So for those of you who are thinking, well, hmm, time is money.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.960]   Well, this is literally time is money and you got to weigh the cost of buying back some
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   of your time and freedom.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.960]   And for those who want to make money on the side, I've been talking about gig work and
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.400]   side hustles for ever.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.080]   I myself gave over 500 Uber rides to try to figure out the system when it was a more profitable
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.840]   endeavor.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.440]   It is a way to earn side income money.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.380]   If you need the side income money, there is literally an endless number of things you
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.460]   can do to make more money.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.140]   To recap, Sydney, what would some pieces of advice be for you so that listeners don't
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.300]   go through what you went through?
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.980]   I mean, first of all, I felt like a complete idiot about the whole thing.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.500]   You know, I, I first of all, shouldn't have booked my flights without checking first to
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.300]   see if I had my passport.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.380]   It was just a very unusual situation where we had to rebook my mom's existing flights
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.060]   and figure out when my sister and I could both go to accompany her.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.260]   So we were all scrambling with little time.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.540]   We weren't, you know, I wasn't thinking that clearly.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540]   I was in a rush.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.200]   So definitely, if you know you need to travel internationally, get your passport in order
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.980]   well before you need to book your flights.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:53.340]   And also utilize not only your local area to get passport appointments, but look beyond.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.020]   You know, initially I was only thinking about San Francisco and it wasn't until a friend
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.300]   of mine said, "Hey, you know, when I had to do my passport stuff, I went over to Marin.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.020]   It's not that far and they always have appointments."
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.460]   And even though I couldn't get an appointment as quickly as I wanted, I did have an appointment
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.260]   there as my plan B.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:18.060]   So think outside the box, be aware that waiting times are long right now.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.060]   They do change.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.240]   And you can get all of the latest on the Department of State's website to figure out how their
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.620]   processing times are and all of the details that you need to get a renewal or to get a
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.900]   passport for the first time.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.660]   And there's another benefit and that is the Navy SEAL saying, "Full benefit."
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.340]   And what does full benefit mean?
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.980]   Well, bad things, unfortunate things happen all the time.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.260]   And the idea is, it comes from the thought process that every challenge we face is a
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.780]   chance to get better or to grow as a person.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:58.060]   And not only that, the harder a challenge is, the more value it holds.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:04.100]   So whatever you do in life, whether it is trying to start a family, finding a job, losing
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.940]   a job, competing in a recreational game or a sports tournament, whatever it is, you're
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.140]   going to face a lot of challenges.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.420]   Starting this podcast or starting Financial Samurai, there are a lot of challenges, a
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.980]   lot of naysayers or no can do's.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.700]   And so when you see adversity, instead of saying, "Oh, you're killing me, adversity.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700]   What bad luck?"
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.660]   You say, "Ah, full benefit."
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.820]   What are some of the things we can learn from this unfortunate event?
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.660]   I remember in college, it was a senior year, it was raining, storming at the College of
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.660]   William & Mary.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.620]   I was in the computer lab at 10 p.m.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.540]   I was finishing up my 20-page term paper, 20 pages, folks.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.220]   And then the power vanished.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.980]   And I said, "Oh my gosh, no."
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.460]   And then the power came back on.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.020]   And I was like, "Okay, did it save?"
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.000]   And it didn't save one bit.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So what did I do?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Did I quit?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.340]   Did I go back and soak?
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.700]   Did I go drink a milkshake or get a beer?
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   Nope.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.860]   I just sat in that chair for, I think, the next three hours after I had already been
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.380]   there for three hours to write an even better term paper.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.100]   And I told myself, "This stinks, but I'm going to use this opportunity, full benefit,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.420]   to get better and write a better paper."
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.460]   And that is what I did.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.460]   What about you?
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.140]   Any other difficult times in your life where you thought, "Well, this stinks, but full
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   benefit"?
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:34.340]   Yeah, I mean, all different sorts of things from, you know, family issues to getting into
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.740]   college to, you know, having to do a violin recital and forgetting my song on stage.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.300]   You know, whatever it is, at whatever age you are, however big or small it may seem,
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:52.620]   if it's intense to you in that moment, do your best to take a step back.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:00.300]   Think about the bigger picture and the opportunities that the challenge will teach you and enable
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.820]   you to, and ways it'll enable you to get better.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.140]   Yeah, because if you're not making mistakes, if you're not failing, I don't know if you're
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.140]   really trying.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.140]   Maybe you're just going through the motions and you wake up 20, 30 years later and wonder,
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.140]   what else?
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   What happened?
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.020]   How come I'm not in a better position?
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.460]   So every single mistake, every single difficult time is a way to get better.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.900]   Now, I know I said in the beginning of this podcast, we were going to talk about retirement
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.060]   and how much you need and all that, but let's save that for another episode.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.100]   I think it'll be really good to get into the details there because a lot of you were really
