[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.

[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.080]   You heard about it here again.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.600]   That's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.520]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey to
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120]   upgrade life, money, and travel.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.840]   Today's conversation is with my good friend and fellow podcaster, Joe Salsihai.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.280]   Joe's career in media started when he was the money man on Detroit's local
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.040]   TV station, WXYZ, and now he's the creator and host of the award-winning
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.160]   podcast, Stacking Benjamins, and a co-host of the Money with Friends podcast.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.440]   He's also appeared online in more than 200 places, including CNBC
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.520]   and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   And in his previous life, he was a financial advisor and certified
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   financial planner for over 15 years.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.960]   Now, we're all quite fortunate for his decades of experience because he has a
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.600]   fantastic book that he coauthored with award-winning writer, Emily Guy-Burken,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.640]   that just came out yesterday.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   It's called Stacked, Your Super Serious Guide to Modern Money Management.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.800]   While the content is all very legit, the tone of the book, like Joe's podcast,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   is approachable and downright funny.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.160]   I am excited to talk to him about how to pick investments, including why he thinks
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.080]   the key to becoming wealthy is to strategically undiversify when it does or
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.960]   doesn't make sense to hire a financial advisor, hacking all your insurance
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200]   policies, and more.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   We'll also tackle a few listener questions about money and financial planning.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   But before that, you should know that I work at Wealthfront and all opinions
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   expressed by me and my guests are solely our own opinions and do not reflect the
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.760]   opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.240]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.480]   on for investment decisions.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.600]   Okay, I know you'll enjoy this conversation with Joe, so let's jump in.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.680]   Joe, it's cold in the Midwest.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.840]   The holidays are around us.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.680]   This book is coming out.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   How are you doing?
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.320]   Well, I'm in Northeast Texas and it's slightly cold.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.160]   I'm a cold weather guy, dude.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.200]   I'm not, I know you're a sit on the beach guy.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Sometimes they say people are mountains or beach.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.600]   I'm more mountain than beach.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   So this is good for me.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.480]   It's a fire in the fireplace, a big book to read.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.560]   How great is that?
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.920]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.560]   I'm excited.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.480]   Big book launch.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.560]   You have published, I'm going to guess over a thousand episodes of a podcast in
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   your career, all about money, but you decided that you wanted to take on
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   another side project and write a book.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.400]   What led you to do that?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.080]   Cause I'm nuts.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.800]   I was drunk.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.120]   Would that be a good story, dude?
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.160]   I was so we were, we were drinking one night.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   Yeah, no, it didn't happen that way.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.560]   What did happen was very seriously.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.880]   And by the way, thanks for having me on.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.920]   And I know we're going to have, we're going to have a blast, but I had written
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.800]   a book over the course of 10 years.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.760]   Like a lot of people have, it completely sucked.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.400]   It stopped.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.920]   It started.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.320]   It stopped.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.800]   It started.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.200]   It stopped.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.720]   It started.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.280]   And it was super, it was, you know, where this book says it's your super serious
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.360]   guide to modern money management.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.880]   This book was overly serious.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   And it was like, this is the definitive book of big ideas on the internet.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.920]   And it was just garbage.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.800]   And so over the top.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   And it didn't really resonate with me.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.520]   And I was frustrated.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.920]   In fact, I handed it to my spouse.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.800]   First person is your spouse.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.120]   The first person that reads your stuff.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   I handed it to Cheryl and immediately she got three pages in.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.720]   She's this sucks.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.600]   This is horrible.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.840]   And so we were on a trip out to Portland, Oregon, and I don't know if you've ever
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.200]   been to Powell's bookstore.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.720]   And yeah.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.400]   And I don't know if this is the way it really happened, but in Joe's head, what
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.200]   happened was Powell's was this little tiny store in this block of buildings that are
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.920]   all connected.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.280]   Right.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.320]   And as the store next to them went out of business, they blew out the wall and then
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.920]   they made the store bigger and bigger to the point that now for people that have never
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.800]   been there, it's a whole block and the building doesn't really work.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.560]   It's, it's, there's all kinds of weird stairs all over the place.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.080]   And I think on one end, the third floor is in the same place.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.960]   The second floor is on the other end.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.280]   It's a great place though, for somebody like you or I to go get lost.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.200]   And I get so many creative ideas there.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.080]   And I end up in the kids section like I would, and I'm, and I see the Hardy Boys
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.200]   detective manual.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.080]   And I don't know if you read this, but in fourth grade, my brother and I carried
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.640]   around this thing, Chris, that was just amazing to us.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.120]   It was written with the help of a real live FBI agent.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.280]   So this was legit.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.200]   Second was it showed you how to do everything that a detective would do.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.440]   I ended up buying the copy because I was so inspired.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.040]   I remember just in, in fourth grade, my dad would be pulling out on a day that was
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.560]   muddy.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.360]   And we go out and look at the tire tracks of his car to analyze his tire tracks.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.120]   Or my mom would touch a doorknob and we'd go over with the tape and we'd take her
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.080]   fingerprint off the doorknob because you're not sure where mom's been.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.520]   And so I had this idea and I thought, this is so great.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.120]   It's so approachable.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.800]   And even as an adult, I thought if there were a book like this, that adults carried
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.720]   around the way I carried this around in fourth grade and it was about money, like
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.200]   that's what we're all looking for.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.320]   We're looking for kind of this guide that we can dog year.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.040]   And I thought, okay, I've interviewed a bunch of people on the show and I haven't
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   had that.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   So that was the germ.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.440]   But we fly back to Michigan where I was living at the time and my mom dropped off
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.800]   my stuff that was in her attic.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.600]   I'm 50 years old, man, I'm 50 years old.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.720]   My mom's finally giving me the sixth place father, son bowling trophy, right?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.720]   From this tournament we were in when I was like seven and my little league photos.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.800]   But the big thing that was in there, it was the cub scout wolf guide.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.560]   And a lot of what you talk about hacks that I think is super important and has
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.680]   always been important to me is if you gamify this, if you find ways to build
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.640]   milestones, like a lot of the time, my clients, when I was a financial planner,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.280]   they would have these big, huge goals and they were so hard to get to.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.560]   So we would build these milestones along the way so we could celebrate and we could
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.280]   figure out if we were ahead or behind our pace.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.640]   If we keep track of pace, I've run 11 marathons and I keep track of my pace the
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.520]   whole time so that I come in where I want to come in.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   It's the same thing I think with a lot of these big financial goals we have.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.120]   Tony Robbins even has said that we overestimate the things we can do in a day
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.760]   because we over plan the to-do list.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.800]   But because we never plan a five-year plan or a one-year plan, we underestimate the
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.240]   number of things we can do in a year.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.080]   If we chunk those down into smaller pieces, we could do it.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   So the Cub Scouts, though, in the Cub Scout Wolf Guide, these guys, Chris,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.560]   gamified things way before all these cool FinTech apps did.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.240]   And they did it in a very similar way, but back when I was a kid.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   And it was very simply all the tools that you're going to need.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.440]   And then they told you how to do the task.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.800]   And then there are a bunch of checkboxes at the bottom to show proficiency, right?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.760]   And then at the bottom for you to get your badge, you get a badge and there's a
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.120]   place for your mom to sign it to verify that you did it.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.240]   And I thought that is so cool and it's so campy.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.760]   And so when we created Stacked, it starts off with people that know nothing.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.000]   And at the end, as you know, we're talking about strategic underdiversification,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.600]   about tax planning, about estate planning, about how to hire advisors that won't
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.920]   bleed you dry, about modern portfolio theory.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.120]   Like we're in at the bottom of the book, some heavy stuff.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   But it goes piece by piece and we do it like it's achievements.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.080]   And there's a place at the end of every chapter for your mom to sign that you did
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.160]   it. So that was the idea.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.200]   There were a few ideas. I love gamification.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.520]   I don't see it enough in the people I've interviewed in the books that I've
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.040]   interviewed. I think we need that.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.640]   I think second, a guide that people can dog ear and carry around could be very
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   important. And then third, and you and I have talked about this a lot.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.000]   There's a report that I love by this group called Nonfiction.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.720]   And it's the secret financial life of Americans.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.320]   And this thing hit me hard.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.640]   But a big statistic was that 150 million people in America report that they've
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.280]   cried about their money. 150 million people.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.840]   And you'd think that those people are people that are living paycheck to
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.040]   paycheck. But almost 50 percent, a little less than 50 percent of people that make
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.560]   over $250,000 a year report that they're crying about their money.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.400]   And it's funny when we talk about money, we often talk about, so what's hot?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.000]   What's the new thing? What's the cool new tech?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.400]   I don't think, Chris, people are crying about the fact that central bank digital
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.320]   currency is probably going to be a factor in our lives more and more in the next
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.600]   couple of years. And that's like the hot new thing.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.040]   They're not crying about the fact that the mega backdoor Roth IRA might be going
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.720]   away. It's not what they're crying about.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.840]   So there's a lot of people I think that are being missed because even though apps
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   I think are doing a kick ass job of gamifying, I haven't seen as much in the
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.480]   press. So we want to have a book that kind of bridges that gap.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.440]   I appreciate the advanced copy and I definitely checked off some boxes and I
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   actually loved it because there were some chapters where I was like, I got this.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.680]   I'm just going to move to the next one.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.480]   And it made it really easy for at least for me to process and run through.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.680]   You mentioned some of the advanced stuff, which is where the hacks come in.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.720]   I know there's a lot of fundamentals and I think a lot of people listening have
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   laid the fundamental groundwork.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.160]   And if not, now there's a book.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.960]   You can go buy it. I assume it's sold wherever books are sold.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.200]   Right. Absolutely.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.520]   We can we can skip to the advanced stuff is what you're saying.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.160]   No, no, no. I'm just saying that I feel like the theme is like digging into some
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.960]   of the hacks and some of the basics of personal finance.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   Like when you're when you have debt, some of the basics are tackling it from the
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   high interest first and getting down to the point that the only debt you really
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480]   have is so low interest that the most important thing is to probably invest
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.680]   for the future instead of pay off your one or two percent loan.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.600]   So I don't want to gloss over that because for so many people, those foundations
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   are really important. But in the spirit of the hacks, I wanted to dig into a few
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.040]   of the things that I thought were a little bit contrarian that to me, I was
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.760]   like, oh, this seems like an opportunity for me to tweak and optimize.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.560]   And it doesn't have to be at only the advanced level, but one of the things was
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   around investing and how people make a decision on what to invest in.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.640]   And we did an episode with my boss, Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   And we talked kind of at a high level on some of the fundamentals of investing,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.960]   when to buy, not to time the market and that stuff.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.680]   But we didn't really talk too much about picking investments and how to decide
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.160]   what to do. How is your kind of conversations with people and all the
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.120]   research you did for the book led you to have your own new opinion on how people
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   should invest?
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.320]   The funny thing is, for me, actually, it isn't a new opinion.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.760]   It's been my opinion for a long time.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.440]   Because whether I was a financial advisor, and that was a long time ago, to the
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.400]   whole Stacking Benjamins, second career, having fun, having a podcast, people
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.920]   writing me their questions, the question always, a lot of questions wrapped up in
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.600]   FOMO, wrapped up in, hey, there's this thing going on.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.960]   Should I jump in? Or what's the hot investment?
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   I go to a party. I try not to tell people what I do a lot of the time, because
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   it's almost always, so what are you telling people to invest in today?
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   What's the one thing that people should be getting into?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.840]   And I think that's tip.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.000]   Yes.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.560]   And the frustrating thing is that I feel like that makes you walk around, that
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.960]   makes people walk around like, I'm so afraid that I'm going to miss something
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.360]   that I have this whole fear missing out.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.240]   And I think that the better way to do this in the hack is all in your approach.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.560]   I love, by the way, when I read this book, I didn't think it, I didn't think it
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.600]   appealed to me. Like, I read this book and I went, ah, a long time ago.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.520]   It's this book called, little book called Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.800]   Affected People. And I know a lot of your audience has probably read this book.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.480]   And if you haven't read it, you probably should, because at the time I thought it
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.000]   was okay. It was meh. And now I quote this book all the time, because if you begin
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.640]   with the end in mind and you work backward, it is so much easier, Chris, to
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.200]   choose investments because the key to choosing the right investments is in, is
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.840]   in doing enough research to make the right decision on the investment for you.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.760]   And if we're trying to track the full field of all the investments that are out
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.720]   there, we're going to end up not building a good enough funnel with enough data
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.520]   points to make a good investment decision.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.640]   So the first key is I want to limit my scope and the amount of time at the top of
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.720]   the funnel so that I can spend more time digging into just a few investment
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.600]   opportunities. And clearly the way to do that is think about it like a farmer
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.040]   thinks about crops in a field, right?
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.520]   If I'm planting corn, I'm from West Michigan, so everything is agriculture for
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.360]   me. If I'm planting corn, farmers over, over thousands of years have figured out
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   that there's a day you plant or a week or a time you plant the corn and there's a
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.720]   time that you take it out.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.800]   You don't plant it at different times.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.200]   You don't take it out of the field at different times.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.760]   And so you think about your planting time and your harvest time.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.400]   It's the same thing with investments.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.280]   So if I have a 15 year time frame, let's say, and I know how much money I'm going
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.160]   to need at that time, I can build a simple spreadsheet that shows me how much
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.000]   money I need to save to get there.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   Maybe, you know, per month, per year, per week, whatever you want to do, times
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.600]   whatever interest rate I need equals the goal.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.200]   And once I have that, by the way, for all my different goals, and I like building a
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.760]   visual sheet because most people, just the way our brains work, we're visual
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.040]   people. So instead of writing this, I like having visuals on a timeline.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.680]   Once I have that, though, and I know how my goals work against each other, I can
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.080]   then start figuring out my cash flow toward those goals better.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.040]   And when I look at those interest rates, it takes this huge field of investments
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.880]   that are available to everybody, and it narrows the field to only the investments
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.800]   that have fit that purpose.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.640]   And when I start there, then I limit the top of the funnel by so much.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.520]   And then all these inputs that you and I get all the time of, "Hey, there's this
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.960]   opportunity. There's this new thing.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.280]   There's this cool deal I can invest in." I can immediately fit it to the end and go,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.920]   "Yeah, that doesn't fit." Which means an investment might be cool.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.080]   It might be great.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.280]   It might be awesome.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.080]   And it still just isn't for you because it doesn't fit.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.640]   And it's being able to say no to some opportunities that might be a great
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.440]   opportunity, but good for somebody else, is a lot of times the best thing you can
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.280]   do for yourself.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.800]   How do you find that kind of world of investments and narrow it down?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.680]   You know, everyone's always looking for the next hot investment, but let's shelve
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.480]   that because I feel like finding the next hot investment is almost always a losing
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.720]   proposition. People who professionally try to pick the next hot investment over
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.760]   time seem to always underperform.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.040]   But what about just sourcing alternative investments?
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.880]   Do you have an opinion on things outside of just the stock market fitting into
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.600]   people's portfolios, whether they're real estate, agriculture, crypto, all that
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.200]   kind of stuff?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.920]   I love all of those.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.000]   Yes.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.440]   The answer is yes.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.240]   When it comes to alternative investments, I don't think you start with the field,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.840]   Chris, because if you start with the whole field, once again, you're going to get
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.640]   this FOMO and you're going to waste a bunch of time investing stuff that doesn't
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.600]   fit what you want.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.480]   And a key, I think, with alternative investments is, I hate the word passion,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.560]   but I think you have to be into it enough.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.000]   You have to like it enough that you can do the research it's going to take for you
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.320]   to get in there.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.400]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   Recent crowdfunding rules have really opened things up for people, which is super
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.360]   exciting.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.960]   It used to be that very few people could invest.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.920]   And I'll give you an example that I like in the world of art, right?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.000]   Art used to be something that has been a high potential return place.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.120]   You can also get your butt kicked in art.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.640]   But art is super interesting, mostly because of the fact that over long periods of
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.920]   time, it consistently art has beat the pants off of inflation, has just smoked
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   inflation.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.720]   But art was something when I was a financial planner, I couldn't recommend because
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.800]   back then before these crowdfunding rules, I couldn't tell my client to go find a
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.040]   Van Gogh, right?
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.720]   If I'm working with somebody that maybe has a million and a half dollars or $500,000
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.880]   or whatever the amount is, the Van Gogh is going to suck up a huge portion of that.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.120]   And to have that in one painting is just a ridiculous risk that I would never
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.760]   recommend that anybody takes.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.600]   And I know we're going to talk about strategic underdiversification, but I still
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   wouldn't take that risk.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   But now when I can put my money in a fund that buys art, or I can put my money toward
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.520]   a painting, but only own a fractional share of that painting.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.760]   Now, all of a sudden, I'm really interested in this asset class.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.080]   But then I also look at, so when I look at that asset class, I also have to think
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.520]   about historically, how has it bumped around and how has it bumped around versus
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.200]   other things that I've invested in now?
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.840]   And for that, and if we really want to deep dive, I think we get in a modern
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.200]   portfolio theory and Dr.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.880]   Harry Markowitz and the Efficient Frontier.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.480]   And if you look at the line on the Efficient Frontier, if I'm buying art, I also want
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.680]   to buy other things along with art that can also not just smooth out my ride, but
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.960]   make it so that, because that art's probably going to be, is going to have some
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.760]   characteristics like illiquidity that might get ugly.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.800]   Art during downturns tends to hold its value.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   However, during downturns also, it holds its value because there are fewer sales,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.960]   like people, which increases the illiquidity.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.560]   So look at the way that I just looked at it.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.640]   Instead of starting off with, what are all the different things out there?
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.520]   I look at, okay, I'm really interested in art.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   Is there a way for me to buy into the art community?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.920]   What are the different ways to buy?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.680]   I can buy fractional shares of a painting.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.320]   I can buy an individual painting.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.880]   I can buy into a fund that buys a lot of different paintings.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.800]   Then I look at how those different things work.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.200]   I look at how art works over time.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.000]   I place it with the rest of my portfolio and see where it will
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.840]   fit with the rest of my portfolio.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.240]   And then I start thinking about making a decision and that decision then later
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.840]   on down the funnel will include what's the cost, right?
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.000]   Cause the people that run these funds, these crowdfunding funds,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.080]   they ain't doing it for free.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.240]   So what's my cost benefit analysis.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.840]   Also with crowdfunding is the world changing and how is that changing?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.080]   And I don't have answers, Chris, to any of those questions,
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.120]   but look at what I just did.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.800]   Like I created this whole funnel of interesting conversations that are going
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.280]   to lead me to a much better decision point.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.920]   And at anything, I went to Catholic school and I remember brother Jim in my
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.160]   religion class telling me that at some point you either believe or you don't.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.520]   Right.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.560]   And I think it's the same with investing.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.800]   You get as much data as you can.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.400]   And my goal has always been to drive as much data as I can to put the odds in my
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.240]   favor.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.640]   And it's only after I have a bunch of data that I actually decide whether I'm
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.400]   going to pull the trigger.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.800]   And at that point, do I believe or do I not believe?
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.040]   And then I push the button to buy or I go looking for the next opportunity.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.160]   So two things.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.920]   One, if we lost anyone talking about modern portfolio theory or the efficient
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.280]   frontier, I'll just put some links in the show notes to some stuff to read,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.320]   including the book.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.200]   So that's one.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.280]   Two, we didn't get into any specifics.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.440]   Are there any platforms out there that you talk to a lot of fintech companies
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.120]   that are interesting or exciting to you that if someone wants to think about
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.560]   things that are worth checking out?
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.040]   Let me tell you this.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.840]   I'm going to tell you what to avoid because there's garbage out there, Chris.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.640]   What I get more worried about than what's the hot thing.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.240]   And I'll give you a couple of things that I like to since you asked.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.360]   So I'm not going to completely avoid the question, but I'll tell you there is a
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   real estate syndication company and I'm not going to say the name,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.120]   but there's a real estate syndication company that for a long time,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.960]   and people ask about it.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.000]   I saw somebody ask about it in a Facebook group yesterday and this company drives
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   me crazy because on there on the front page of their website,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   they had a forward looking graph of about how this is expected to perform.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.400]   And it said name of the company engineered for superior real estate results.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.840]   Who the hell do you and I know in real estate that isn't hoping to engineer for
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.800]   superior results? Like really?
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   Real estate's like the oldest asset class on earth.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.800]   These whiz bang people finally figured out a method that nobody's figured out
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.560]   before them to engineer for superior results.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.080]   And then they show a forward looking graph, which by the way,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.960]   if the sec was paying attention,
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.320]   you and I know a mutual fund can't do that and exchange traded fund can't do
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.400]   that. I don't know how these guys were getting away with it.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.440]   So beware charts and graphs. Number one,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.640]   beware somebody that tells you that they have picked the lock on something that
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.080]   nobody else has ever done. Really? Yeah.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.920]   I just don't think so.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.480]   Yeah. Yeah. And when it comes to any alternative, one thing I always ask is the
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.000]   value proposition, the way the company makes money,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.680]   is it by providing a value that was new to people, right?
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.720]   So take the case of fractional art. We're going to take a fee.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.160]   We're not telling you art is going to 10 X because of our company.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.320]   We're just saying we can give you access to it.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.800]   And we take a fee to manage that access. And I'm like, Oh, right.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.320]   I will pay someone to do something that allows me to do something I couldn't
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.880]   otherwise do. That makes sense. Absolutely.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.920]   And so look at what they're trying to present themselves as that's an important
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.440]   one, but you, I'm going to hold you to it.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   You said you were going to share some of the ones you're interested in.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.520]   Yeah, I get, I do get interested in farmland.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.040]   I think that farmland,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.680]   even though the past few years have been really a lot of investors going that
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.640]   way, I think farmland is still super exciting.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.560]   I think it's exciting for a guy like me because it's so boring.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.080]   The things that I like about investments aren't the new, sexy, wild things.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.720]   And don't be wrong. Those are fine. But if an investment,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.200]   if I can easily understand how somebody makes money,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   I can easily understand my downside.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.800]   I get why I would make money.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.080]   And I think there's a reasonable expectation that I will make money.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   And my downside is not that high. I think that's why I like farmland.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.880]   It's just, it's easy. It's straightforward. It's simple.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.240]   It's one that even though so many investors have gone to the last few years,
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.800]   I still don't see the rush there like I have in residential real estate.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.120]   And it's completely the opposite of what's going to happen in commercial real
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.000]   estate. Commercial real estate is, it has to have a transformation now.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.680]   And I don't think, I don't think a lot of people,
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.000]   definitely people above my pay grade are figuring that out today as we speak.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.160]   It seems like with every business you get to a certain size and the cracks start
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.760]   to emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.960]   And you have too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.440]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.600]   one, 37,000.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.120]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.480]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.600]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting,
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more. 25.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.400]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less,
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.320]   close their books in days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.880]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:36.680]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.080]   good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.960]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.040]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.760]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.480]   theraflavins and catechins.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.120]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.600]   heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.120]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.080]   travel friendly. They have so many products,
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.120]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.920]   energy and the black Pu-Erh,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.560]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.840]   is so good and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.440]   And if you need another reason,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.280]   search for all the amazing research backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.760]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.000]   other teas in the world.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.960]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.360]   free US shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.800]   And for a limited time you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea

[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.200]   That's P I Q U E.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.400]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak P I Q U E.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.240]   So when you talk to most people about investments, they'll say,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.120]   you got to diversify as much as possible.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.200]   And one of the contrarian opinions in the book is that the key to becoming
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.960]   wealthy is to strategically undiversify. Can you unpack that?
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.440]   And the reason I write about this is because it's what everybody wants their
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.360]   advisor to do. And being a guy that was an advisor for a long time,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   they want advisors to make them rich. Let's be clear.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.640]   A fiduciary financial advisor will never tell you how to get rich with money.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.840]   They won't. They'll show you how to diversify your money for two reasons.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.680]   Number one,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.840]   they know that your number one way of becoming wealthy is actually keeping an
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.160]   income stream that adds to investments that beat inflation.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.720]   So if they can help you figure out the behaviors to continue to put more money
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.640]   in, and then they can diversify usually into something that mimics the indexes,
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.360]   right? And keep you close to the efficient frontier. What I'm saying, Chris,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.520]   is that what a certified financial planner is going to tell you is boring is
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.360]   good, but sexy is not where you want to be. Boring is good.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.720]   And doing the other thing is great, but I'm not a financial planner anymore.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.240]   So I get it. And by the way,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.120]   the other thing is think about what can go wrong with strategic under
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.000]   diversification. If you are wrong,
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.920]   what we're going to do here is do something called increased standard deviation.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.400]   So let's take standard deviation.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.560]   Standard deviation is the wiggle in your portfolio.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.960]   And when people used to come into my office and we would build a portfolio
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.920]   together and we determine what indexes we're going to mimic and how we're going
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.160]   to put the portfolio together,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.200]   I would then run the software to show you the standard deviation on that
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.800]   portfolio. And if you look at one standard deviation, either way,
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.040]   I'll tell you, Chris, for you and your family, this historically,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.600]   we're aiming for 8.5% after tax.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.680]   We're in for an 8.5% rate of return. That's what we're getting. Now,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.400]   here's the good news is one standard deviation.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.160]   And we're not going to go into all that, but in most years,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   we can have 14% above that. And it's still a normal year.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.400]   That's fantastic.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.520]   We could also have 10% below that and it's still going to be in the
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.880]   range of expected results. And we're going to be okay. If we get that wiggle,
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.680]   that which is what we expect with this portfolio, we're going to be okay.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.200]   And it's like a weather report,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.880]   or it's the pilot of the plane who tells you you put in the fasten seatbelt sign
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.760]   on, because it's going to be a bumpy ride. Like looking ahead.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.240]   I love standard deviation because it's a look ahead on what I can expect from
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.400]   this investment. And I'll give you an example.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.760]   When you saw the last couple of years, the market dropped 14%.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.840]   14% for the S&P 500 is within that first standard
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.520]   deviation. Meaning that's a normal day.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.600]   That's actually a normal time. It's not a bear market.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.920]   And what's going on CNBC and Fox visit. They're freaking out.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.960]   They're freaking out. We're going to, but things are tail spinning. No,
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.920]   they're not. This is just pretty bumpy day on the ride.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.600]   So what we do to strategically under diversify is we
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.840]   increase standard deviation, which means our upside potential gets higher,
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.800]   but you also have to remember, Chris, then what does that do to the downside?
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.840]   We're also taking on a lot more risk.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.920]   And to give you an example of how this is work for people, Dave Ramsey,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.600]   my buddy Dave in Tennessee tells his followers to
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.120]   invest in actively managed mutual funds,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.080]   usually through a company called American funds. And that's what he advocates.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.400]   Dave is a hugely wealthy person, just monster, wealthy, wealthy,
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.280]   build a huge company lives in this monster house has a gigantic net
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.920]   worth. Dave did not get wealthy following Dave's advice.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.000]   Dave didn't diversify a bunch of mutual funds.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.960]   Dave tried twice the first time he bought some real
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.800]   estate properties and he went bankrupt.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.440]   So he increased standard deviation through real estate and he went bankrupt
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.320]   doing it, owed people a bunch of money. Then he came back, right?
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.120]   This is Dave story.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.720]   Dave comes back and he builds a company telling people not to do that.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.280]   And he made money, not owning a diversified collection of stuff,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.600]   but by owning one company, one thing, that's how Dave got rich.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.640]   So if you're really interested in being wealthy, find something that's good,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.880]   make sure it doesn't stink. Make sure that you're,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.240]   that it's going to actually do what you hope it does.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.280]   And you're going to get wealthy a lot faster.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.880]   The bad news is you're going to get poor a lot faster if it doesn't go the way
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.720]   that you want.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.000]   Yeah. And like you said earlier, focus on something you know about,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.720]   you care about, you can pour your heart and soul into some random thing that
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.760]   someone told you at a party.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.400]   Jason Zweig in the,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.240]   who's a phenomenal writer in the wall street journal a couple of weeks ago,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   was talking about a gentleman who has been managing money since
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.080]   the mid 1970s. And he's only given five interviews during his career.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.120]   He's stepping down from managing money.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.240]   And Jason talks about the key to his success. He owns very few companies.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.880]   He doesn't waste a lot of time on the top of the funnel.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.760]   Like we talked about earlier dealing with FOMO and all these different ideas.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.040]   He owns just a few companies and he spends 90% of his time understanding the
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.320]   heartbeat of those companies explicitly.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.160]   He knows everything about these companies.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.320]   Yeah. It sounds like you got to make good decisions and stick to them,
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.040]   which you said the value of hiring an advisor is about helping you make good
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.880]   decisions.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.320]   A question I've gotten a few times from listeners is how do you make the
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.480]   decision to hire an advisor? When does it make sense?
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.920]   How do you interview them? You've been one for over a decade.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.560]   Now you're not one and you can give whatever advice you want.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.800]   How would you answer that question to people?
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.680]   Yeah. And I want to,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.120]   and I would be careful here because I've been told by people that because I was
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.160]   a financial advisor,
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.800]   people all of a sudden think that I'm going to have a bias toward them.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.880]   And so when I talk about advisors,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.000]   I want to just warn everybody ahead of time that I think differently about
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.600]   advisors I think than most people do. And when people fire their advisors,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.720]   I generally think that is a good thing to fire your advisors.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.920]   And it's mostly Chris because they have the wrong relationship with their
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.520]   advisor. I think so with that preamble,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.240]   let me lay this out. I think we all need advisors. Everybody need advisors.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.840]   I need somebody who's not me,
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.160]   who's not emotional about my stuff, who I know has my back,
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.720]   and who is going to give me some good ideas and tell me where
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.600]   I'm stepping in it.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.400]   What's cool is that Walt Disney back when he was creating Disneyland,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.840]   and this was, think about Disneyland at the time.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.040]   The thing that he was competing against were these fairs that went,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.720]   these garbage fairs that went from place to place and carnivals were known as
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.200]   dirty and dirty people that work there and
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.280]   sketchy environment. In a lot of cases,
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.800]   he's trying to create this clean family,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.960]   something that's differentiating from that,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.560]   but he still was a pioneer going in this new direction.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   So a great story about Walt Disney was he would often wear a disguise where he's
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.840]   wearing a hat or a hat and a wig or some sunglasses.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.960]   And he'd walk around the park and he'd stand in lines and he'd fire up a
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.600]   conversation with people in line with him and go, Hey,
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.400]   what do you think about this ride? What do you think?
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.120]   What have you heard about it? Is it, do you think it's as good? Man,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.720]   I've been thinking about some things that this park could have that it doesn't
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.600]   have. What could this park have that he's looking for advice all over the place.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.920]   And for him, it was hard to give Walt Disney advice.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.120]   I've read a lot about Walt and it was,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.040]   he was very opinionated and it was hard to look him in the eye and say,
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.840]   I think you're messing up. But he craved that.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.160]   And I think we should all crave that.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.680]   I think too often we get defensive and instead we should be asking ourself,
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.840]   where am I messing this up? If I ask more often, I have that growth mindset.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.920]   Where am I messing this up? I think I'm going to do a better job.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   So even if I'm just starting out, Chris,
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.720]   I want to take wealthy people that are going,
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.480]   that have already been where I want to go. I want to take them to lunch.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.760]   I want to pick their brain. I want to put them on my board of directors.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.200]   And the reason I like people firing advisors is because if you've an advisory
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.640]   relationship where you have abdicated the throne
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.000]   and they're doing it for you,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.200]   instead of advising you and how you won't step in it and how to do a better job,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.400]   you have the wrong relationship. And to give you an idea,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.800]   everybody talks about Tesla. I'm actually, as a Detroit guy,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.520]   I'm a fan and I groan sometimes, but I am a fan of General Motors.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.920]   I'm a fan of Mary Barra and the job that she's done,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.880]   taking this legacy organization and trying to make them competitive.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.440]   And I watched that because that's a huge struggle for the whole city.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.480]   But Mary doesn't not show up at work, Chris.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.600]   She doesn't not show up at work. She doesn't go, Hey, okay,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.160]   I'm going to meet with you twice a year about these cars we're making.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.040]   And I'm going to go do something else,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.360]   which is what people do with their financial advisors. No,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.600]   Mary goes to all the meetings. She knows everything about a car.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.480]   I just went to this thing, Camp Phi, which was awesome.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.440]   She goes to the camp outs and meets with other people that are car enthusiasts.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.360]   She goes to the engineering meetings.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   She talks the talk about unions and pay scale and economics and what's selling
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.480]   and what's hot, what's new, what's the, she goes to everything.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.600]   But then what does she do?
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.520]   She surrounds herself with these phenomenal engineers and vice presidents who
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.640]   are smarter than she is about every aspect of the car.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.000]   And that I think is what we want in our life.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.680]   So my standpoint in the most long way possible,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.800]   I think we should all have advisors. I really,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.360]   it is less dangerous to hire a CFP,
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.960]   but as you can tell by my explanation of what an advisor is and what advisor
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.320]   isn't, I actually don't really care. Hire people that, you know,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.840]   have your back. We say hire a CFP and hire a fiduciary. Why is that?
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   Number one, a CFP is somebody who I know has this depth of knowledge about the
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:08.480]   things that go on in creating a financial plan. That's good. I want that.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.840]   The second thing I know about some CFPs is they are this thing called a
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.360]   fiduciary,
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   which means they are required to do what they think is in my best interest.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.720]   I want all my advisors to be fiduciaries.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.760]   So those two things, if you're checking boxes, yes, ask those,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.200]   but more important, I'm really just looking, what is my fit?
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.160]   What is your expertise? How do you make me go faster?
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.560]   How do you make me smarter?
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.680]   How do you involve me in the process so that I can still do other things and
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.520]   still be involved in what we're trying to create together?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.800]   That's who I'm looking for as advisors.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.400]   And what about on the execution side?
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.960]   Do you think it makes sense to hire someone to rebalance your accounts and tax
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   loss harvest and that kind of stuff?
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.720]   That's not really advice as much as execution.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.600]   Doesn't matter at that point, right? That's not advice. That's delegation.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.240]   Do you want to hire a team to do that?
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.160]   Do you want to hire asset managers to manage the asset for you to hold them?
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.400]   Maybe. It depends on what you're,
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.320]   if you start with your end and where you're trying to go and work backward,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.040]   you'll make some great decisions on whether what you delegate and what you keep.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.680]   Just realize this, that I had a family member die recently.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.680]   And the thing that we always try to optimize is our money.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.040]   And the thing I don't think we optimize enough is our time.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.960]   And it made me realize yesterday that you don't know when the story's going to
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.760]   end and don't waste your time doing tasks that are below your
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.360]   pay grade. And by pay grade, I don't mean a money amount,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.280]   meaning stuff that you really don't value that aren't going to give you that
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.000]   richness that we're all looking for. Delegate that crap,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.520]   delegate as much of it as you can.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.480]   But be involved to know how the decisions get made.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.840]   Absolutely. Don't abdicate. And I love it when I hear Chris,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.000]   people fire their advisors. They're like, I just fired my financial advisor.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.280]   And generally,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.840]   I think that's a good thing if you're trying to reinsert yourself in the process
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.680]   because you made this mistake of being in a relationship where you just handed
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.920]   over the keys to the kingdom. You don't want to do that.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.320]   Okay. This is going to be a bit of a hard turn,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.720]   but it's something that I thought was really interesting in the book.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.720]   You know, maybe we should have started here because it's a far more first step
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.720]   thing. We talk, you talk about emergency funds.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.600]   And the reason I want to bring this up is I have always looked at the emergency
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.080]   fund and thought, okay, I could leave a couple months of cash somewhere.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   And the argument was always, you might lose your job. You might, you know,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.640]   need to pay for a expensive medical bill. And you know,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.000]   those are all fine. And those are good reasons to hold emergency funds.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.840]   There were a few things you put on there that kind of made it seem like an
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.320]   emergency fund could be a hack to save you money.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.240]   And I would love to talk about them because I've always
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.600]   seen the emergency fund as this boring thing that costs you, right?
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.720]   It's cash that's sitting somewhere and not earning.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.560]   But you pointed out things like raising the deductibles on your policies,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.960]   because you have this emergency fund, which saves you money each month.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.760]   Can you talk a bit about some of the things that you think make emergency funds
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.480]   financially beneficial beyond just paying for emergencies that might arise?
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.680]   Yeah. Insurance companies want to talk about buying insurance,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.080]   and you don't want to have that discussion.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.640]   The discussion you and I want to have as owners of our, you know,
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.200]   personal business, which is our life is our business.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   We want to think about risk management.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   And even we talked about portfolio building. We talked about risk management,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.240]   right? What can go wrong?
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.640]   So the first thing I want to ask is not what insurances should I buy?
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.680]   It is what could go wrong and then how do I meet that? And for most of us,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.440]   once you build an emergency fund, it can save you to your point, Chris,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.280]   so much money and not just insurances. I'll tell you in another way,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.160]   the when you build that fund,
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.920]   you can then self-insure that you can meet it because you have cash in the bank.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.000]   Why would I hire an insurance company to do something that may also be a low
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.040]   risk? So I look at the risk of,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.400]   of it happening versus the amount of money that I'm paying for it.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.640]   And I'll give you an example here.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   When we look at our homeowners and our car insurance,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.120]   which of those insurances cost more for most of us,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   it's your car insurance costs more,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.320]   but which asset for most of us costs more, if you're maybe for some of us,
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.080]   our car costs more than our house. But I think for most of us,
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.280]   if we own a house, our house costs more than our car,
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.360]   but insuring it's all a lot less. Why is that?
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.120]   A house has a bigger magnitude. The magnitude of the loss will be bigger.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.680]   The chance of the loss is much, much smaller.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.360]   I believe the numbers are for car insurance. I think it's one in 300.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.840]   And for homeowner's insurance, it's about one in 1200.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.400]   And those are stats off the top of my head.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.440]   But whenever you look at what the insurance company is offering,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.320]   I always look at what's the pricing on these different policies.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.040]   And this is a mind shift for most people. I want to focus not on insurance,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.480]   but I want to focus on those issues that actuaries have told me are expensive
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   by jacking up the price on insurances.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.720]   And I want to have a great strategy in those areas.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.360]   And if it's something that they're valuing very cheap,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.000]   I know that the risk of that happening is not as big and I don't need to focus
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.920]   on it. So is it, so for car insurance and for homeowners, I can know,
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.680]   I have this opportunity to have a low deductible or a high deductible.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   That's the amount you're going to pay first before you have a claim.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.440]   So make sure your experience is good before you do this.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.640]   But if you have an emergency fund,
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.520]   you can jack up the deductible and you save yourself a bunch of money because
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.360]   you're going to self-insure.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.320]   And you're not saying self-insure the entire loss.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.320]   You're just saying self-insure against needing a low deductible.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.560]   Exactly.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.800]   Self-insure the first thousand dollars or the first 10% or whatever that might
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.600]   be. Self-insure that minimal thing and insure the catastrophic stuff, right?
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.880]   The stuff that's going to sink your financial plan, insure all that.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.360]   Disability is another one. Keep long-term disability insurance in place,
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.480]   but short-term disability insurance,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.280]   which is super expensive because you're going to use that first,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.520]   the first maybe six months.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.280]   If you get to the point that you have six months of expenses in an emergency
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   fund, I don't have to, I don't have to buy short-term disability.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.560]   I can use that emergency fund now to do it. And I've avoided a huge expense.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.440]   And by the way,
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.920]   something that statistically happens to a lot of people at the same time.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.680]   There's another thing that I said that, that where you also save money,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.360]   I see people freak out about their investment strategy,
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.160]   especially people that tell me that they have a high risk tolerance,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.320]   but they've never seen a downturn. And there are, as you know, Chris,
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:46.160]   a lot of people listening to the show who started investing in 2008,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.320]   2009, right? And all they've seen is this roaring up market.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.920]   They haven't been through 2007 in the early days of 2008.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.680]   They haven't been through 2000 to 2002, which is when I lost all my hair.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.200]   Those times you act a hell of a lot differently than you
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.920]   think that you will. And I'll give you an example. People say, Oh,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.680]   I can deal with a 25% loss. That sounds fine.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.160]   Let's say your portfolio is a million dollars. Let's put that in dollar numbers.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.320]   If you and I are sitting across the table from each other and I say,
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.400]   you lost a quarter of a million dollars in the last three weeks,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.720]   you're going to act differently. You're not going to act like 25% doesn't mean
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   anything to my brain. A quarter of a million dollars sounds absolutely horrible.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.640]   So when you take these and you put real numbers on them,
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.600]   I saw people as an advisor do all kinds of bad stuff,
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.000]   but this is where an emergency fund comes through.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.960]   Yeah. A lot of people say your emergency fund is not earning anything.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.320]   But then I thought about pet insurance and I thought, Oh,
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.840]   I've set aside enough money in my emergency fund to cover if anything goes
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   wrong. And pet insurance, you know, it could be 50, 60, 70 bucks a month.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.560]   I don't actually remember the exact amount,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.760]   but what my emergency fund is earning is not paying that pet insurance each
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.520]   month. So in a way, if you think about it from that perspective,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.240]   it actually is earning interest,
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.760]   but it's earning interest in the form of not forcing you to pay for these
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.720]   things that you otherwise would have maybe paid because you don't want to have
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.320]   to sell your portfolio to pay for your pet surgery or something like that.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.600]   Yeah. Yeah. In emergencies,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.760]   you don't have to meet and also bad decisions that you can avoid.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.520]   Yeah. And now part of that, you talked about insurance.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.440]   And I think you've talked to me about in the past,
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.160]   different ways to hack insurance and some tips and tricks.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.920]   Disability is where you started.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.960]   I know very few people I know have ever talked about disability insurance.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.640]   Lots of people talk about life insurance. I know some employers cover it.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.880]   I don't actually know if employers usually cover enough,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.000]   but in the book you kind of talked about disability insurance as this thing that
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.200]   a lot of people overlook. Is it something more people need to be looking at?
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.800]   Is it only for people who aren't employed or how do you advise people to think
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.640]   about it?
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.480]   No, it's the number one insurance that, that I think more that we need.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.760]   And it's the number one thing we don't want to talk about.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.280]   We think we're pretty safe people. We're safe skiers and it's not about you.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.840]   And if you look at how expensive it is,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.400]   actuaries have figured out that the chance of it happening to you is better than
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.080]   you think, by the way,
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:21.520]   the number one reason people default on their home loan and most people don't
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.000]   know this.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.160]   It's not that somebody is a deadbeat and they just stopped paying their mortgage.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.200]   It's actually a disability. A disability happens.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.960]   All of a sudden they can't make the mortgage payment default on the loan and
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.320]   they're out of their house. So disability insurance is huge.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.720]   If you have it through work, look at that policy first.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.200]   The problem with workplace policies is that they often have a cap.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.040]   So in other words, they'll say, we will, Chris,
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.160]   give you 65% of what you earn,
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.240]   but we're going to cap it at $3,000 a month,
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.600]   which for many people listening to this show isn't 65% of what they
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.680]   earn. They may earn North of that.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:04.040]   And so it really is a $3,000 a month policy on top of that
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.480]   amount, that money. Also, if it's taken out as a pre-tax deduction,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.560]   it's also going to be taxed. Now we're really getting in the weeds.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.520]   So you're not actually getting all that money either.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.040]   If you buy a policy on your own,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.280]   it's generally going to be used with after tax dollars,
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.760]   which means that the benefit will be tax free when you receive it.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.080]   So it's an expensive insurance. People should get it,
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.680]   but start off with what do I need, right? What's my need?
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.760]   And then work backward. What do I have through work?
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.080]   Watch out for the cap and then go buy extra.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.520]   So when I see that Aflac duck commercial, the emergency insurance,
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.680]   I'm the guy going, yeah, yeah. Directionally that's,
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.120]   and that's not an Aflac commercial.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.880]   I'm just saying that's what the Aflac people are talking about.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.760]   And people should start investigating that. And it's the same, by the way,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.520]   it is the, it's the same when people are retired.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.720]   The number one threat to your long retirement is long-term care,
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.000]   that we're going to have this catastrophic illness there.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.320]   The long-term care insurance is a bloodbath.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.280]   It is so ugly that frankly we're at this spot where,
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.560]   where, Oh gee, it was a working CFP still on our show. He and I commiserate,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.760]   Chris, we don't know what to do.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.280]   We know you need a plan because it's the a number one threat,
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.480]   but buying long-term care insurance is just the cost benefit is so
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.000]   tough and you have to dedicate so many assets to it that it really drives me
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.200]   crazy. It's a conundrum. You see a lot of CFPs talking about right now.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.720]   What do we do in the case of long-term care? And really,
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.760]   I don't have a great answer. How about that? None of the hacks.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   We should not call that part of the show. None of the hacks.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.320]   Well, you had a good one for homeowners insurance, which I loved,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.440]   which I've never had a homeowner's claim and, and I believe you have.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.360]   Can you talk about what happens when you get that claim and how you can make it
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.200]   go a lot better?
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.560]   Yeah, it's wild. Some of this stuff, unfortunately I play tested.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.640]   I like there was a time when I was,
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.840]   was a nomad in the middle of my life and I play tested what we told people for a
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.720]   long time, which is try your financial independence dream ahead of time.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.800]   But unfortunately I also tried out my homeowner's coverage and I've been telling
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.040]   people for a long time to take pictures of your house, take a video,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.840]   just go around your house with your phone, take a video, go open drawers.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.680]   You can cruise through rooms at a fairly quick rate and just look at everything
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.600]   because my experience and most people's experience,
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.160]   if you're working with a good insurance company and most of them are fine,
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.720]   they will ask you, they, they gave me Chris,
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.160]   they gave me a blank sheet and they said, what's in your house?
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.400]   What did you have? Our house got robbed. Okay. House got robbed. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.600]   Thank you. Sorry. I missed that key point. Our house got robbed.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.200]   We were in Chicago on vacation.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.920]   Our house was here in Texarkana, Texas and,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.160]   and we had a neighbor called that said they came over to, you know,
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.080]   check on our cat and my front door was open and it clearly been,
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.880]   somebody had taken some tools to my front door and it had ripped it open.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.000]   And for who knows what reason they were able to disable my not that great,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.800]   apparently security system at the time. And, and they took stuff.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.360]   And luckily we had taken video of our house.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.280]   There was a second thing there too, though, that was wild,
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   which is for some of the electronics that we had, they said,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.840]   do you have the serial number of your televisions?
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.320]   Cause if you have your serial number, here's, what's usually going to happen.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.880]   They're going to take it to a pawn shop and they're going to try to get some
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.520]   money for it. But if you have the serial number, when they turn that in,
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.240]   we've got them like we've, I still, I took the video.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.600]   I didn't have my serial numbers. When you buy high priced electronics,
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.840]   just have a place where you put down all the security,
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.680]   all the serial numbers of your things.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.600]   And would they not reimburse you if you didn't have the serial number?
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   They did. They actually still did. When I, mine did, I,
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.320]   I had a great insurance company that I was working with and they reimbursed me
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.840]   for my, I had two computers stolen. I had an Xbox stolen.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.960]   I had two televisions stolen.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.880]   We had some jewelry that was worth nothing to anybody except
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.280]   my spouse. And that was really sad. Cause some of it was heirloom stuff.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.000]   We had some art stolen that was expensive. That stuff,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.240]   I had not had appraised and because I hadn't had it appraised and had it added
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.040]   to the policy, we had had some other things added to the policy. Luckily,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.280]   Cher was wearing an expensive ring that she had. She'd taken it with her.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.120]   So that one we had separate as, as itemized on the policy.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.640]   But, but yeah,
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.240]   make a quick video because for a lot of stuff they sold, they reimbursed me.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.840]   I just had to know what I had and think about that.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.240]   If your house burns down, it's going to be the same thing.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.520]   But if your house burnt down today and they gave you a blank sheet of paper and
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.280]   they said, Chris, what's all the stuff you owned?
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.080]   I don't even know where to start.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Yeah. I get a quarter of it, man. I wouldn't even get a quarter of it.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.880]   And I don't think I own that much, but I still wouldn't get that.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.440]   Wouldn't get that much. So yeah, that's a great hack.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.640]   Yeah. If there's one thing you do after listening to this,
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.480]   walk through your house, make your own, as you said in the book,
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.840]   like your own MTV cribs, treat it like a fun thing and save,
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.360]   save a record of everything you own.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.440]   And I guess if you have serial numbers do that also, but yeah, I wouldn't even,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.680]   I don't even know if I would get a quarter of the stuff. It's just,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.240]   there's jackets that you'd forget and it would be so easy to just take a video.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.880]   And the quality of most videos now is so good. If we did this 20, 30 years ago,
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.120]   it's like, well, there's some clothes in the closet,
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.080]   but in most cases we just need something to spur our memory. You'll go, oh yeah.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.360]   Oh yeah. And that corner, there was that thing and this other thing. And yeah.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.960]   Yep. Love it.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:44.280]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.560]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.160]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.240]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.720]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.880]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.240]   so you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.040]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.240]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.040]   sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.480]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.520]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade,
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.680]   but this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.640]   it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.800]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription. Right now,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.240]   trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.

[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.840]   plans, allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.760]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.400]   up your cooking at home? If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.640]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit,
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.160]   I was a skeptic at first,
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.840]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.560]   I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.920]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.600]   scratch in the microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.160]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.720]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.400]   and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer,
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.640]   and oven safe too.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.120]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.360]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice. It is so good.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.120]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched last
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   year, you have to check it out. So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.240]   support us. Before we go, we've hit a lot.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.280]   I do want to tackle a few questions that I've gotten from listeners that I feel
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   like who better than a former CFP and snarky podcast host to help answer these
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.480]   questions. We answered one about financial advisors and how to think about it.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.720]   One that I wanted to know if you had any tips for someone said, you know,
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   I'm kind of new to investing. I started investing.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.040]   Taxes are a little bit more,
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.520]   it's not an employer thing as easy where it's just so obvious they withhold.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.520]   What does someone investing need to know about taxes and are there any tricks?
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.760]   You do need to know a bunch about taxes, but really knowing the basics.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.640]   If you start off with the basics, taxes are way more easier than you think.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.400]   What I would recommend that everybody does,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.800]   and I actually had a tax expert. We talked about advisors.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   One of my best advisors was a CPA who sat me down and told me about how taxes
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.880]   work. You know what they did first, Chris,
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:19.280]   they had me read with them just the 1040 form and the itemized deduction form.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:24.240]   And the itemized deduction form does not apply to as many people as it used to
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.120]   because of some tax reform a couple of years ago.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:31.200]   But still once you understand how the 1040 is laid out, believe it or not,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.320]   you're going to find opportunities much more quickly.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.040]   And it's like riding a bike once you read it once and you understand it once
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.720]   you'll understand why a credit beats a deduction.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.920]   You'll also understand where any write-offs you can do work,
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.160]   how tax loss harvesting works.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   You'll also understand why using an HSA is kick ass and an FSA.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.840]   If you can use an FSA and you have a good budget can also work for you.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.120]   FSA is a little different than an HSA. You use it or lose it.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.320]   There's some exceptions around COVID right now,
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.920]   but in an average year with an FSA, you're going to use it or lose it.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.720]   Yeah, totally agree on the FSA.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.080]   If you're listening and you don't subscribe to the All The Hacks newsletter,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.160]   we actually did a whole thing maybe a week or two ago about FSAs and a whole
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.440]   bunch of other year-end tax tips, tax loss harvesting,
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.760]   what to do there and all that good stuff. So if you're not a subscriber to that,
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.600]   go check it out.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.120]   And I'm sure Chris, you went over this in the newsletter,
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.880]   but I will say one thing. There was a headline we did this year.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.720]   We have a headline segment in our show and there was a guy who is actually a
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   professional who was trading GME like a lot of people were and he kept getting
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.160]   in and out and in and out and in and out. And he,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:50.120]   he didn't realize wash sale rules mean that if it's not in an IRA,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.440]   when you sell something,
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.520]   you got to stay out for 30 days to be able to claim it on your taxes.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.680]   Wash sale rule is an easy thing once you know it,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.000]   but it's also this speed bump that a lot of people get wrong.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   Yeah. So the main takeaways and Cody, thanks for sending this question in.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.760]   We didn't even hit the basics. It's just,
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.920]   if you're investing and you hold something for a year,
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.960]   you get preferential tax treatment. But like Joe said,
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.600]   anytime you sell or buy something, if you do the same thing within 30 days,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.640]   it can really mess you up. So keep an eye on that.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.800]   And you do have to hold the money for taxes.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.400]   So if you have a big gain in early in the year,
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.240]   that money that you're going to owe in April the following year,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.440]   you can't go spend it.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.480]   I have a horrible story from someone I worked with who played the crypto game.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.960]   And in, I want to say it was like 2017,
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.720]   they made like $800,000 on crypto and they took all their
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.160]   earnings. And in 2018, the following year,
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.760]   they went and invested in some other crazy crypto thing and lost it all.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.040]   And when it came time to file their 2017 taxes,
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:58.400]   they didn't have the money to pay the bill and you can't use a future year.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.080]   You can't say, well, no, no, no, I lost the money later. So they, I don't,
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.920]   I never heard the resolution, but that was either a, you know,
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.960]   negotiate with the IRS or file for bankruptcy kind of thing.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.360]   So if you sell anything and have a gain,
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.600]   take the money you're going to owe the IRS,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:19.520]   put it in a separate account and ignore it because you need that money next year.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.640]   And there's not a lot of options if you don't have it.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.840]   Oh, that's just, yeah. And I'm betting what that,
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.200]   where they ended up was a payment plan.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.080]   I'm sure they probably ended up on it,
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.920]   but I would do a payment plan way before bankruptcy there. But Chris,
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.280]   I thought of one more that people are still listening to this in the last couple
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.120]   of days of this year. That is super important.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.760]   We think that the backdoor Roth IRA might go away.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.600]   I would make sure if you have,
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.720]   if you're doing a conversion and talk to your team that you've set up,
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.880]   that we talked about earlier about whether you're doing conversions or not, man,
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.800]   if you're doing backdoor Roth IRAs, I would,
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.160]   I'd make sure you do it this year because it might be bye-bye.
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.160]   Yep. Yeah. One of the items on the list is a backdoor Roth.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.880]   So check that out. And the same goes for Roth conversions.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.720]   If you have a lot of traditional IRA assets, I mean, you're in a low tax year.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.440]   It could make sense to roll them all over to a Roth.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.600]   You'll take a little bit of a tax hit this year, but you know,
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.120]   you won't pay taxes in the future. So get it done. Amen. One more.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.560]   Jeff asks what to do and how to hack and how to optimize for aging parents.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.520]   A lot of us are going to be in a circumstance where our parents,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.720]   if they're still around, you know, might not have everything they need.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.520]   We might need to take care of them. We might even,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.200]   they might have everything they need, but we might need to help them with money.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.440]   It's not as easy as our friends where we're like, Oh,
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.960]   just go get a robo advisor and think about it in 40 years.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.440]   And any advice for someone whose parents are aging and don't have their finances
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.280]   in order?
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.080]   The first thing that I would worry about Chris is I would worry about talking to
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.960]   your parents the right way. Cause your parents knew you way back when,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   and I remember I've been a financial planner for 10 years. I,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.280]   my practice was very successful. And I remember my dad 10 years in saying,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.720]   so this financial planning thing, you think you're still going to do it?
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.880]   Like you think you're going to stick with us? Like, yeah, yeah, dad,
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.000]   I think it's, I think it's going to go. Okay. It's feeding my family.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.840]   I think we're doing fine.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.040]   But so your parents have a different outlook about you and they're going to take
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.440]   your advice differently.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.280]   And they may also feel like you're pressuring them and you don't want to do
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.520]   that. They may also wonder what your agenda is,
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.240]   depending on your family dynamic.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.520]   I will point people to another book which is written by a
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.160]   woman named Cameron Huddleston. You know, Cameron, Chris?
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.040]   No.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.280]   Cameron Huddleston wrote a great book about talking to elders about their
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.360]   money, talking to your parents about their money.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.240]   And I believe the book is called mom and dad, we need to talk.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.880]   And it is a fantastic book about all the things that can go wrong in those
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.320]   discussions. But,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.640]   but to begin that discussion in the right way is really important.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.080]   And one hack that she shared with me is that often your parents
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.400]   don't want you button into their money,
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.680]   especially parents of a certain generation. They might be very private.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.480]   If they are private.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.000]   If you start off with a little oversharing on your part about what you're doing,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.600]   they may then reciprocate. I used to read these great books,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.640]   these detective books that were written about the Navajo nation,
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.800]   which were fantastic.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.040]   And this detective in the book was a guy named Joe Leaphorn.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   And when I was a financial planner,
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.720]   I would use the Joe Leaphorn rule of getting more out of people
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.240]   than I probably deserved.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.640]   And what I would do that Joe Leaphorn did was I'd share a little bit about me
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.320]   that was maybe a little oversharing. And in almost every case, Chris,
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.120]   the person across the table from me would also then share something on their end
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.320]   that they weren't supposed to share. That might be a little extra with parents,
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320]   especially just say, Hey, you know what?
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.240]   I've really been thinking about like how I manage my money the next 10 years.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.560]   And here's what I was thinking for the next 10, 15 years that this would go,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.400]   you know, that I do this, I do this, I do this. And then they'll share, well,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.800]   I was thinking about I'm doing this and this thing.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.760]   And now we have an in to start talking about their money.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.560]   And you still preserve the parent child relationship where in the big scope of
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.560]   things, they're also giving you advice. One more thing,
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.080]   still with older people solve for when they're going to spend the money.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.320]   A big mistake that I find Chris is that people go,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.640]   and I'm going to just throw this out there. They're going to say,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.520]   let's say that you think that crypto is a great idea and you go not with
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.800]   grandma's money, right?
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.880]   I'll tell you that if grandma is never going to spend that money and it's going
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.520]   to go in a glad bag with all the other estate stuff and go to the
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.080]   child, you think about when that money's going to be spent.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.560]   If the money's never going to be spent and the money is an asset that's meant
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.480]   for a child to maybe spend grandma taking risks is not always a bad
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.840]   thing. If you start with the end in mind,
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.000]   I have seen lawsuits, which I always wonder about.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.320]   I wonder about some third party family member coming into a situation going,
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.520]   Oh my God, my grandma owns a growth stock. Grandma doesn't buy green bananas.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.040]   Like why are we buying something that's as volatile as a growth stock?
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.160]   It might be because grandma has a team of people she's working with and grandma's
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.680]   not thinking about her lifetime.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.760]   She's thinking about this is money that in my trust is going to go to my
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.600]   grandkids.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.400]   My grandkids are now three and this is money that's going to be spent 15 years
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.800]   from now. So even with grandma, don't think about end of life.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.880]   Think about when that crop needs to be harvested.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.960]   Yeah, that's great advice. Last one is from John and this is a fun one.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.320]   He wanted to understand leverage in a portfolio, right? And it was interesting.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.280]   He said, you know, I move around a lot. Buying a house is not something
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.120]   interesting,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   but it seems like everyone who buys a house takes out a mortgage and gets this
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.000]   great leverage where you put 20% down on an asset that can appreciate.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.520]   And if that asset appreciates,
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.000]   you get the appreciation from the whole asset and you only put down 20%.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.440]   So what role does leverage have for someone who's not buying a house?
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   Oh, great question.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.720]   Cause leverage magnifies everything,
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.120]   which means it's going to go hella good.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.040]   It's going to go so much better when times are good,
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.800]   but it's also going to unravel more quickly.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.840]   So what wealthy people know is that they are predisposed.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.880]   And I've seen so many studies on this.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:35.200]   Most wealthy people are predisposed to not using leverage except in very
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.080]   strategic cases. So I'll give you an example,
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.160]   interest rate on your mortgage, very low.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   If you've got a pot of money sitting in a bank account where you can pay the
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.400]   mortgage off right now, and it's not going to mess with your psyche,
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.800]   not paying it off.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.200]   Why would I take money that's earning in an I-bond earning over 7% and put it
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.680]   down on a house with a mortgage that's at two and a half? I shouldn't do that.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.400]   Now what I might do is if there's a way, and there's not with an I-bond,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.480]   but taking money out of my investment portfolio every month and have it pay that
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.080]   monthly bill.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.800]   So I just have freedom from worry and the pile of money can pay it.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.720]   That's a great use of leverage.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.760]   I'm using interest rate arbitrage between those two positions.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:25.160]   But I start off from a place of it's incredibly dangerous and I don't want to
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.440]   use it unless I have completely thought through,
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.840]   not wow, this looks like a great opportunity,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.960]   but if the walls come crashing down, how is this going to look?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.600]   And I'll give you an old guy story. Real estate right now.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   We talked about earlier about how there's so many shysters in real estate.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.120]   The reason Chris is that the real estate market's been,
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.080]   it's easy to be an expert. So there's tons of experts out there.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.040]   And the reason why they're making money hand over fist is because of exactly
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.320]   what he's saying, that because people are using mortgages,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.680]   they're not creating stock market winners, which are small. No,
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.440]   I'm using leverage and I'm creating these big winners.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.520]   But what happened in 2007 2008 real estate has a much bigger,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.560]   and this is by the way, not just that one downturn,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.480]   but when real estate goes bad,
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.840]   real estate flushes so many people real estate is just has a great toilet
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:22.400]   flushing system when things go horrible and it's all because of leverage.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.160]   So real estate is going to be much better than the stock market when things are
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.360]   really great and it's going to be much, much worse when things go wrong.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.720]   Yeah. The couple of things I'll point out that I think make it a little bit
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.200]   different to take on leverage with your investment portfolio is that when you
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.040]   take out a loan against your portfolio, if your portfolio drops enough,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.560]   the brokerage firm is going to call back and say, Hey,
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.560]   you need to deposit more money. And if you own a house and the house value drops,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.360]   if you don't have money to pay your bills, then you're going to be underwater.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.120]   But the bank isn't going to take back the house if the value drops.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:02.040]   So one of the biggest reasons that leverage on your investment portfolio is much
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.040]   riskier than leverage on a home is that you're not guaranteed that they won't
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.680]   recall that if the underlying asset drops.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.360]   And then the second big one is that you're not locking in an interest rate.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.240]   So you could borrow money from your portfolio at one price and interest rates
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.760]   rise and that rate would go much higher and cost much more than you thought it
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.040]   would.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.040]   I have never had a client back when I was a planner where I recommended it and I
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.840]   also never had a client who it didn't make them sleep better at night.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.440]   It always made them sleep worse. Yeah. For the two reasons you said,
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.800]   if the stock market goes South tomorrow, I might get called.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.480]   If you keep those loans small, maybe, but I don't know.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.520]   Yeah. That's one thing that I talked about in another newsletter was look,
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.280]   if you keep the loan small enough, right?
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.240]   If you borrow against your portfolio and you borrow 10% of it,
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.760]   your portfolio is going to have to go down. I'm not going to quote numbers,
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.640]   more than half. I think the magic number is somewhere around like 30, 30,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.840]   40% your portfolio would have to drop by 50%.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.800]   So if you borrowed against 10% and did something with it,
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.960]   I don't think that you have a lot of risk that you're going to get called.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.160]   I still think there's a lot of interest rate risk. Someone told me, wow,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.360]   what if I, what if I borrow against my portfolio at 2% and I go put it somewhere
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.080]   where I can earn 5% and I said, look, if it's a short term kind of thing,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.640]   whether it's a investment or whether it's to renovate your house and you have a
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.280]   plan to pay that back, either with savings or, you know,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.440]   by withdrawing money,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.640]   then you're not really subject to the interest rate risk because if interest
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.240]   rates go up, hopefully you can pay it off.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.200]   And I don't expect interest rates to go up by 5,
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.160]   10% in a matter of months. I've always said, look, if it's small enough,
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:41.560]   that you're not,
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.640]   you're kind of avoiding the margin risk and it's short term or the money you're
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.720]   using it for is something you have access to. It's not as scary.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.240]   Unfortunately, because of those things,
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.620]   because you're not locking in the interest rate,
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.700]   because I just don't think you can take the kind of leverage you can with a
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:01.660]   home as safely. So for me, it's not something that I'm forexing by,
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:01.980]   you know,
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.180]   I'm not taking 80% of the value out of my portfolio and trying to bet it
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.660]   somewhere and the stuff, Chris, it can go wrong, has nothing to do with you.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:13.220]   When we look at the last numbers on inflation and we know what the response is
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.240]   for the fed rate to come up, which is not a direct link for all other things,
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.140]   but the fed rate is the prime mover that,
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.420]   that begins the cascade of other interest rates going up.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.060]   So whether directly or indirectly.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.340]   So if we're in a rising interest rate environment like now,
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.340]   I think the risk is even higher.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.220]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.460]   And I don't think people that have only been thinking about buying a home and
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:42.940]   realize that interest rates for mortgages in the recent past
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:47.060]   have been way higher. So early 2000s,
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.380]   interest rates got as high as seven, 8%. And my,
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.740]   my parents have talked about interest rates being in the teens.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.700]   Back in the eighties.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.820]   Yeah. So I think it's, it's easy to think, gosh,
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.100]   borrowing money is always a, you know, one, two, 3%,
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.940]   because that's what it's been the last few years.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:08.420]   It's very possible if history is any indication that those
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.220]   interest rates to borrow money could go up.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.340]   And that's great if you locked in your mortgage rate for 30 years,
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.100]   but it's not great if you borrowed against your portfolio and,
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.060]   and your interest rate is, is, you know, variable with the market.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.940]   I also like, and this is another hack I like based on what you're talking about.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.780]   I like looking at the next domino, right.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.900]   And another domino that gets played here, if,
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.500]   if people are zoning out, cause like this doesn't apply to me,
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.860]   there's a broader thing that we're saying, which is that if, if you have, uh,
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.460]   loans that aren't fixed rate loans and you have the opportunity right now in this
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.100]   environment to lock in a fixed rate strategy on your debt,
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.060]   if you've debt and you don't have a fixed rate strategy,
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:49.140]   I would be trying hard to switch to a fixed rate strategy.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.700]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We refinanced it.
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.780]   And this is a good example of where I guess you could use leverage to invest.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:59.500]   If you do have a home, if you're refinancing your home and it's appreciated,
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500]   you might have the option to take some money out.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:05.660]   And so this is an interesting one that I had a fun debate with Andy Radcliffe
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.980]   about, you know, he, his kind of stance is you probably should never borrow to
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.900]   invest. And that was his kind of belief. And I said, well,
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.700]   when you buy a new home, it's okay to put 20% down. He's like, yeah.
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.740]   And I was like, but if I own a home and I have 40% equity,
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.660]   can I take 20% out and invest it? And he's like, Oh, this is a,
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.340]   you caught me in a situation where I would tell you if you were buying a new
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.500]   home, then yeah, put 20 down and take the extra and invest it.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.780]   But for me, if you have an opportunity to cash out and refinance it,
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.580]   that's an opportunity that I have personally taken.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.540]   I'm not obviously going to recommend anyone do anything,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.660]   but it's something to consider. And, and the hack here,
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.780]   and this probably only matters if you live in a high cost of living area,
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:49.940]   but if your mortgage interest deduction is $750,000 now in the
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:54.660]   U S if you cash out refi and your mortgage ends up being
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:57.380]   greater and you invest that difference,
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:02.020]   the interest expense you pay on that additional mortgage is actually
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.820]   deductible as long as it pays off interest expense you've earned,
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.980]   meaning capital gains, dividends, appreciation. So that's,
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.340]   I'll put a little quick something in the show notes if you want to dig in
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.100]   there, but that's a little too technical for the rest of this talk.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.340]   And we've already gone deep enough. So I'm going to, I'm going to stop here.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.780]   And if you want more from Joe,
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:26.140]   he has a wonderful podcast that I've had the pleasure of joining a few times and
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.380]   a great book. But Joe, where can people find everything you're working on?
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.140]   Yeah, you'll find us at stacking Benjamins.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:36.620]   And the book is@stackingbenjamins.com/stacked I'm doing a 42 city
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:40.660]   tour, Chris, coming to see as many stackers as possible around the country.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:44.780]   We're going to try to get as many people like you, wherever people live,
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.100]   I get as many of the financial community there.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.820]   So hopefully meet some local people that you might've read or heard before in
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.660]   different towns.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.300]   It's going to be fun for that whole tour and to meet up with us. I know in,
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.460]   in San Francisco, we're going to be at a South Pacific brewing.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:03.980]   I used to live one block from there. Wonderful venue.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.220]   I heard it's a fantastic place. I can't wait to go. But anyway,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:11.620]   to get all the dates stacking Benjamins.com/stacked and come and hang out with
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:15.980]   us and other people, we call them stackers, but come other people trying to stack.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:18.460]   You got stackers. I guess we got hackers.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.460]   Hackers and stackers. Let's get that in San Francisco.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.980]   Let's get the hackers and stackers together.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.580]   Sounds great. All right. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.500]   Thanks a lot, man. That was fun.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.140]   Wow. There was a lot of great stuff in there and I really hope you enjoyed it.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.260]   Lots of stuff for the show notes.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.900]   And if you haven't already looked up Joe's book, definitely check it out on a
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.580]   separate note. We are a few days away from 2022.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.020]   So I just want to say thank you for all your listening and support.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.860]   I can't wait for everything that's coming next year.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.660]   Have a wonderful new year's Eve and I'll see you next week.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:58.660]   [inaudible]
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:13.140]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.660]   money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.660]   retirement. It's called the personal finance podcast,
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.620]   and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.340]   on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.700]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.740]   who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his passion
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:36.660]   and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.580]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:45.300]   but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.340]   will blow your mind.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.260]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:54.940]   in their employer's retirement plan. And that's just one of the many,
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.540]   fascinating stats he shared.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.500]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.260]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.900]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:11.100]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify,
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.740]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
