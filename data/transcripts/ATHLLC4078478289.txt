[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:09.040]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.640]   to upgrade life, money, and travel.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.360]   Today's conversation is with my good friend and fellow podcaster, Joe Salcihai.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   Joe's career in media started when he was the money man on
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.720]   Detroit's local TV station, WXYZ.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.160]   And now he's the creator and host of the award-winning podcast,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   Stacking Benjamins, and a co-host of the Money with Friends podcast.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.160]   He's also appeared online in more than 200 places, including
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.080]   CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.120]   And in his previous life, he was a financial advisor and certified
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160]   financial planner for over 15 years.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.240]   Now we're all quite fortunate for his decades of experience because he
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.480]   has a fantastic book that he coauthored with award-winning writer, Emily
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.240]   Guy-Burken, that just came out yesterday.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   It's called Stacked, Your Super Serious Guide to Modern Money Management.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.680]   While the content is all very legit, the tone of the book, like Joe's
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.360]   podcast, is approachable and downright funny.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.400]   I am excited to talk to him about how to pick investments, including why he
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.000]   thinks the key to becoming wealthy is to strategically undiversify, when it
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.080]   does or doesn't make sense to hire a financial advisor, hacking all your
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.720]   insurance policies, and more.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.520]   We'll also tackle a few listener questions about money and financial planning.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   But before that, you should know that I work at Wealthfront and all opinions
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.960]   expressed by me and my guests are solely our own opinions and do not
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.320]   reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   relied on for investment decisions.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   Okay.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   I know you'll enjoy this conversation with Joe, so let's jump in.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.240]   Joe, it's cold in the Midwest.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.400]   The holidays are around us.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.280]   This book is coming out.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.680]   How are you doing?
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.880]   Well, I'm in Northeast Texas and it's slightly cold.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   I'm a cold weather guy, dude.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.760]   I'm not a, I know you're a sit on the beach guy.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.800]   Sometimes they say people are mountains or beach.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.160]   I'm more mountain than beach.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   So this is good for me.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.040]   It's a fire in the fireplace, a big book to read.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.120]   How great is that?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.480]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'm excited.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.040]   Big book launch.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.120]   You have published, I'm going to guess over a thousand episodes of a podcast in
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.240]   your career, all about money, but you decided that you wanted to take on another
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.840]   side project and write a book.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   What led you to do that?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.640]   Because I'm nuts.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.360]   I was drunk.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   Would that be a good story?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.720]   Dude, I was, so we were, we were drinking one night.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.040]   Yeah, no, it didn't happen that way.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.120]   What did happen was very seriously.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.440]   And by the way, thanks for having me on.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.480]   And I know we're going to have, we're going to have a blast, but I had written
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360]   a book over the course of 10 years.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   Like a lot of people have, it completely sucked.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.000]   It stopped.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   It started.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.880]   It stopped.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.360]   It started.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.760]   It stopped.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.280]   It started.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.840]   And it was super, it was, you know, where this book says it's your super serious
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.920]   guide to modern money management.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.440]   This book was overly serious.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.160]   And it was like, this is the definitive book of big ideas on the internet.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.360]   And it was just garbage and so over the top.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.920]   And it didn't really resonate with me.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.080]   And I was frustrated.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.480]   In fact, I handed it to my spouse.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.240]   First person.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.640]   Is your spouse the first person that reads your stuff?
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.240]   I handed it to Cheryl and immediately she got three pages in.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.280]   She's this sucks.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.160]   This is horrible.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.400]   And so we were on a trip out to Portland, Oregon, and I don't know if you've ever
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.720]   been to Powell's bookstore.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.920]   And I don't know if this is the way it really happened, but in Joe's head, what
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.760]   happened was Powell's was this little tiny store in this block of buildings that are
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.480]   all connected.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.840]   Right.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.880]   And as the store next to them went out of business, they blew out the wall and then
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   they made the store bigger and bigger to the point that now for people that have
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.320]   never been there, it's a whole block and the building doesn't really work.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.080]   It's it's there's all kinds of weird stairs all over the place.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.600]   And I think on one end, the third floor is in the same place.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.480]   The second floor is on the other end.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.760]   It's a great place, though, for somebody like you or I to go get lost.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.680]   And I get so many creative ideas there.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.640]   And I end up in the kids section like I would.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   And I'm and I see the Hardy Boys detective manual.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.560]   And I don't know if you read this, but in fourth grade, my brother and I carried
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120]   around this thing, Chris, that was just amazing to us.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600]   It was written with the help of a real live FBI agent.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.720]   So this was legit.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.640]   Second was it showed you how to do everything that a detective would do.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.920]   I ended up buying the copy because I was so inspired.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.440]   I remember just in in fourth grade, my dad would be pulling out on a day that was
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   muddy. And we go out and look at the tire tracks of his car to analyze his tire
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.120]   tracks. Or my mom would touch a doorknob and we'd go over with the tape and we'd
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.480]   take her fingerprint off the doorknob because you're not sure where mom's been.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.920]   And so I had this idea and I thought, this is so great.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   It's so approachable.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.240]   And even as an adult, I thought if there were a book like this that adults carried
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.160]   around the way I carried this around in fourth grade and it was about money, like
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.600]   that's what we're all looking for.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.720]   We're looking for kind of this guide that we can dog here.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.840]   And I thought, OK, I've interviewed a bunch of people on the show and I haven't had
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.040]   that. So that was the germ.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.080]   But we fly back to Michigan where I was living at the time and my mom dropped off my
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.240]   stuff that was in her attic.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.080]   I'm 50 years old, man.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.920]   I'm 50 years old. My mom's finally giving me the sixth place father-son bowling
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.520]   trophy from this tournament we were in when I was like seven and my little league
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.320]   photos. But the big thing that was in there, it was the Cub Scout Wolf Guide.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.120]   And a lot of what you talk about hacks that I think is super important and has
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.200]   always been important to me is if you gamify this, if you find ways to build
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.760]   milestones, like a lot of the time my clients, when I was a financial planner, they
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.840]   would have these big, huge goals and they were so hard to get to.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.080]   So we would build these milestones along the way so we could celebrate and we could
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   figure out if we were a header behind our pace.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.200]   If we keep track of pace, I've run 11 marathons and I keep track of my pace the
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.080]   whole time so that I come in where I want to come in.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   It's the same thing, I think, with a lot of these big financial goals we have.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.680]   Tony Robbins even has said that we overestimate the things we can do in a day
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.320]   because we overplan the to-do list.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   But because we never plan a five-year plan or a one-year plan, we underestimate the
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.840]   number of things we can do in a year.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   If we chunk those down into smaller pieces, we could do it.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.280]   So the Cub Scouts, though, in the Cub Scout Wolf Guide, these guys, Chris, gamified
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.120]   things way before all these cool fintech apps did.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.800]   And they did it in a very similar way, but back when I was a kid.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.360]   And it was very simply all the tools that you're going to need.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.000]   And then they told you how to do the task.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.360]   And then there are a bunch of checkboxes at the bottom to show proficiency, right?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   And then at the bottom for you to get your badge, you get a badge and there's a place
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.640]   for your mom to sign it to verify that you did it.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   And I thought that is so cool and it's so campy.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.320]   And so when we created Stacked, it starts off with people that know nothing.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.280]   And at the end, as you know, we're talking about strategic underdiversification, about
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   a tax planning, about estate planning, about how to hire advisors that won't bleed you
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   dry, about modern portfolio theory.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.680]   Like we're in at the bottom of the book, some heavy stuff.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.320]   But it goes piece by piece and we do it like it's achievements.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.640]   And there's a place at the end of every chapter for your mom to sign that you did
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.720]   it. So that was the idea.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.760]   There were a few ideas. I love gamification.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.080]   I don't see it enough in the people I've interviewed, in the books that I've
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.600]   interviewed. I think we need that.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.200]   I think, second, a guide that people can dog ear and carry around could be very
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.000]   important. And then third, and you and I have talked about this a lot.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.760]   There's a report that I love by this group called Nonfiction, and it's The Secret
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.280]   Financial Life of Americans.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840]   And this thing hit me hard.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.600]   But a big statistic was that 150 million people in America report that they've cried
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.800]   about their money. 150 million people.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.920]   And you'd think that those people are people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.800]   But almost 50 percent, a little less than 50 percent of people that make over
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.080]   $250,000 a year report that they're crying about their money.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   And it's funny when we talk about money, we often talk about, so what's hot?
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.520]   What's the new thing? What's the cool new tech?
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.920]   I don't think, Chris, people are crying about the fact that central bank digital
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.840]   currency is probably going to be a factor in our lives more and more in the next
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.120]   couple of years. And that's like the hot new thing.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.560]   They're not crying about the fact that the mega backdoor Roth IRA might be going
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.240]   away. It's not what they're crying about.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.360]   So there's a lot of people, I think, that are being missed because even though apps
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.760]   I think are doing a kick ass job of gamifying, I haven't seen as much in the press.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.000]   So we want to have a book that kind of bridges that gap.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.800]   I appreciate the advance copy.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.240]   And I definitely checked off some boxes and I actually loved it because there were
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.000]   some chapters where I was like, I got this.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.240]   I'm just going to move to the next one.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.040]   And it made it really easy for at least for me to process and run through.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.240]   You mentioned some of the advanced stuff, which is where the hacks come in.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.760]   I know there's a lot of fundamentals.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.240]   And I think a lot of people listening have laid the fundamental groundwork.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.680]   And if not, now there's a book.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.480]   You can go buy it. I assume it's sold wherever books are sold.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.040]   Absolutely. We can skip to the advanced stuff is what you're saying.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.840]   No, no, no. I'm just saying that I feel like the theme is like digging into some of the
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.480]   hacks and some of the basics of personal finance.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.720]   Like when you're when you have debt, some of the basics are tackling it from the high
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.320]   interest first and getting down to the point that the only debt you really have is so low
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.080]   interest that the most important thing is to probably invest for the future instead of
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.240]   pay off your one or two percent loan.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   So I don't want to gloss over that because for so many people, those foundations are
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   really important. But in the spirit of the hacks, I wanted to dig into a few of the
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.560]   things that I thought were a little bit contrarian that to me, I was like, oh, this
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.280]   seems like an opportunity for me to tweak and optimize.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.360]   And it doesn't have to be at only the advanced level, but one of the things was around
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.440]   investing and how people make a decision on what to invest in.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.360]   And we did an episode with my boss, Andy Ratcliffe, who started Wealthfront, and we
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.920]   talked kind of at a high level on some of the fundamentals of investing, when to buy,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.480]   not to time the market and that stuff.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   But we didn't really talk too much about picking investments and how to decide what to
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   do. How is your kind of conversations with people and all the research you did for the
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.640]   book led you to have your own new opinion on how people should invest?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.840]   The funny thing is, for me, actually, it isn't a new opinion.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.640]   It's been my opinion for a long time because whether I was a financial advisor and that
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.920]   was a long time ago to the whole stacking Benjamin's second career, having fun, having
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   a podcast, people writing me their questions, the question always a lot of questions
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   wrapped up in FOMO, wrapped up in, hey, there's this thing going on.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.520]   Should I jump in or what's the hot investment?
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.080]   I go to a party. I try not to tell people that I that you know what I do a lot of the
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.600]   time because it's almost always.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.520]   So what do you tell people to invest in today?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.880]   What's the one thing that people should be getting into?
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.440]   Everyone, I think that's tip.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.560]   Yes.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.760]   And the frustrating thing is that I feel like that makes you walk around.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.520]   That makes people walk around like I'm so afraid that I'm going to miss something, that
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.960]   I have this whole fear missing out.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.840]   And I think that the better way to do this in the hack is all in your approach.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.560]   I love by the way, when I read this book, I didn't think it I didn't think it appealed to
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.200]   me like I read this book and I went a long time ago.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.080]   It's this book called Little Book called Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.360]   Effective People. And I know a lot of your audience has probably read this book.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.200]   And if you haven't read it, you probably should, because at the time I thought it was
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.880]   OK, it was meh. And now I quote this book all the time, because if you begin with the
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:57.080]   end in mind and you work backward, it is so much easier, Chris, to choose investments
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.640]   because the key to choosing the right investments is in doing enough research to make
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.400]   the right decision on the investment for you.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.560]   And if we're trying to track the full field of all the investments that are out there,
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.440]   we're going to end up not building a good enough funnel with enough data points to make
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.080]   a good investment decision.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:23.280]   So the first key is I want to limit my scope and the amount of time at the top of the
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.960]   funnel so that I can spend more time digging into just a few investment opportunities.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.440]   And clearly, the way to do that is think about it like a farmer thinks about crops in a
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.600]   field, right?
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.400]   If I'm planting corn, I'm from West Michigan, so everything is agriculture for me.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.800]   If I'm planting corn, farmers over thousands of years have figured out that there's a day
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.240]   you plant or a week or a time you plant the corn and there's a time that you take it out.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.360]   You don't plant it at different times.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.720]   You don't take it out of the field at different times.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.240]   And so you think about your planting time and your harvest time.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.920]   It's the same thing with investments.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.160]   So if I have a 15 year time frame, let's say, and I know how much money I'm going to need
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   at that time, I can build a simple spreadsheet that shows me how much money I need to save
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.240]   to get there, maybe per month, per year, per week, whatever you want to do, times whatever
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.120]   interest rate I need equals the goal.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.800]   And once I have that, by the way, for all my different goals, and I like building a
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.760]   visual sheet because most people, just the way our brains work, we're visual people.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.600]   So instead of writing this, I like having visuals on a timeline.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.480]   Once I have that, though, and I know how my goals work against each other, I can then
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.640]   start figuring out my cash flow toward those goals better.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.880]   And when I look at those interest rates, it takes this huge field of investments that are
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.240]   available to everybody.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.360]   And it narrows the field to only the investments that have fit that purpose.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.280]   And when I start there, then I limit the top of the funnel by so much.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.160]   And then all these inputs that you and I get all the time of, hey, there's this
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.640]   opportunity, there's this new thing, there's this cool deal I can invest in.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.840]   I can immediately fit it to the end and go, yeah, that doesn't fit.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.560]   Which means an investment might be cool.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.680]   It might be great.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.880]   It might be awesome.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.720]   And it still just isn't for you because it doesn't fit.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.240]   And it's being able to say no to some opportunities that might be a great
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.360]   opportunity, but good for somebody else is a lot of times the best thing you can do for
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:27.840]   yourself.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.440]   How do you find that kind of world of investments and narrow it down?
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.280]   You know, everyone's always looking for the next hot investment, but let's shelve
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.080]   that because I feel like finding the next hot investment is almost always a losing
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.720]   proposition. People who professionally try to pick the next hot investment over time
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.360]   seem to always underperform.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.640]   But what about just sourcing alternative investments?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.440]   Do you have an opinion on things outside of just the stock market fitting into
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.320]   people's portfolios, whether they're real estate, agriculture, crypto, all that kind
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.760]   of stuff?
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.480]   Yeah, yeah, I love all of those.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.040]   Yes, the answer is yes.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.800]   And when it comes to alternative investments, I don't think you start with the field,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.600]   Chris, because if you start with the whole field, once again, you're going to get this
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.760]   FOMO and you're going to waste a bunch of time investing stuff that doesn't fit what
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   you want. And a key, I think, with alternative investments is, I hate the word
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.200]   passion, but I think you have to be into it enough.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.760]   You have to like it enough that you can do the research it's going to take for you to
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.920]   get in there.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.000]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.440]   Recent crowdfunding rules have really opened things up for people, which is super
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.560]   exciting. It used to be that very few people could invest.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.120]   And I'll give you an example that I like in the world of art.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.600]   Right. Art used to be something that that has been a high potential return place.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.280]   You can also get your butt kicked in art, but art is super interesting, mostly because
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.440]   of the fact that over long periods of time, it consistently art has beat the pants off
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.120]   of inflation, has just smoked inflation.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.520]   But art was something when I was a financial planner, I couldn't recommend because back
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.000]   then before these crowdfunding rules, I couldn't tell my client to go find a Van Gogh.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.920]   If I'm working with somebody that that maybe has a million and a half dollars or
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.760]   five hundred thousand dollars or whatever the amount is, the Van Gogh is going to suck
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.440]   up a huge portion of that.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.200]   And to have that in one painting is just a ridiculous risk that I would never recommend
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.320]   that anybody takes.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.160]   And I know we're going to talk about strategic underdiversification, but I still
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.720]   wouldn't take that risk. But now when I can put my money in a fund that buys art or I
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.080]   can put my money toward a painting, but only own a fractional share of that painting.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.320]   Now, all of a sudden, I'm really interested in this asset class.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.040]   But then I also look at so when I look at the asset class, I also have to think about
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:01.600]   historically how has it bumped around and how is it bumped around versus other things
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.760]   that I've invested in now and for that.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   And if we really want a deep dive, I think we get in a modern portfolio theory and Dr.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.440]   Harry Markowitz and the Efficient Frontier.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.120]   And if you look at the line on the Efficient Frontier, if I'm buying art, I also want to
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.640]   buy other things along with art that can also not just smooth out my ride, but make it
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.560]   so that because that art's probably going to be is going to have some characteristics
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.320]   like illiquidity that might get ugly.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.360]   Art during downturns tends to hold its value.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.640]   However, during downturns also it holds its value because there are fewer sales like
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.520]   people, which increases the illiquidity.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.080]   So look at the way that I just looked at it instead of starting off with what are all
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.160]   the different things out there?
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.040]   I look at, OK, I'm really interested in art.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.080]   Is there a way for me to buy into the art community?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.480]   What are the different ways to buy?
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.200]   I can buy fractional shares of a painting.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.840]   I can buy an individual painting.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.400]   I can buy into a fund that buys a lot of different paintings.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   Then I look at how those different things work.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.720]   I look at how art works over time.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.600]   I place it with the rest of my portfolio and see where it will fit with the rest of my
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.560]   portfolio. And then I start thinking about making a decision.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.360]   And that decision then later on down the funnel will include what's the cost, right?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.200]   Because the people that run these funds, these crowdfunding funds, they ain't doing it for
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.760]   free. So what's my cost benefit analysis?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.400]   Also with crowdfunding, is the world changing and how is that changing?
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.720]   And I don't have answers, Chris, to any of those questions, but look what I just did.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:37.200]   Like I created this whole funnel of interesting conversations that are going to lead me to
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.880]   a much better decision point.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.000]   And at anything, I went to Catholic school and I remember Brother Jim in my religion
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.720]   class telling me that at some point you either believe or you don't.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.160]   Right. And I think it's the same with investing.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   You get as much data as you can.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.400]   And my goal has always been to drive as much data as I can to put the odds in my favor.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.440]   And it's only after I have a bunch of data that I actually decide whether I'm going to
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.360]   pull the trigger. And at that point, do I believe or do I not believe?
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.600]   And then I push the button to buy or I go looking for the next opportunity.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.080]   So two things. One, if we lost anyone talking about modern portfolio theory or the
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.840]   Efficient Frontier, I'll just put some links in the show notes to some stuff to read,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.720]   including the book. So that's one.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.840]   Two, we didn't get into any specifics.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.520]   Are there any platforms out there that you talk to a lot of fintech companies that are
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.480]   interesting or exciting to you that if someone wants to think about things that are worth
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.600]   checking out? Let me tell you this.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.400]   I'm going to tell you what to avoid because there's garbage out there, Chris.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.120]   What I get more worried about than what's the hot thing.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.800]   And I'll give you a couple of things that I like, too, since you asked.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.360]   So I'm not going to completely avoid the question, but I'll tell you there is a real
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.600]   estate syndication company and I'm not going to say the name, but there's a real estate
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.520]   syndication company that for a long time and people ask about.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.320]   I saw somebody ask about it in a Facebook group yesterday.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.360]   And this company drives me crazy because on their on the front page of their website,
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.720]   they had a forward looking graph of about how this is expected to perform.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.080]   And it said name of the company engineered for superior real estate results.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.880]   Who the hell do you and I know in real estate that isn't hoping to engineer for superior
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.400]   results? Like really?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.600]   Real estate's like the oldest asset class on Earth.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.760]   These whiz bang people finally figured out a method that nobody's figured out before
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.120]   them to engineer for superior results.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.960]   And then they show a forward looking graph, which, by the way, if the SEC was paying
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.560]   attention, you and I know a mutual fund can't do that.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.240]   An exchange traded fund can't do that.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.000]   I don't know how these guys were getting away with it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.280]   So beware charts and graphs.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.040]   Number one, beware somebody that tells you that they have picked the lock on something
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.080]   that nobody else has ever done.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.520]   Really? Yeah, I just don't think so.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.440]   When it comes to any alternative, one thing I always ask is the value proposition, the
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.920]   way the company makes money, is it by providing a value that was new to people?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.040]   Right. So take the case of fractional art.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.240]   We're going to take a fee.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.720]   We're not telling you art is going to 10x because of our company.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.120]   We're just saying we can give you access to it and we take a fee to manage that
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   access. And I'm like, oh, right, I will pay someone to do something that allows me to
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   do something I couldn't otherwise do.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.440]   That makes sense. Absolutely.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.800]   And so look at what they're trying to present themselves as.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.960]   That's an important one. But I'm going to hold you to it.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.000]   You said you're going to share some of the ones you're interested in.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.040]   Yeah, I get I do get interested in farmland.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.160]   I think that farmland, even though the past few years have been really a lot of
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   investors going that way, I think farmland is still super exciting.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.120]   I think it's exciting for a guy like me because it's so damn boring.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.640]   The things that I like about investments aren't the new, sexy, wild things.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.000]   And don't be wrong. Those are fine.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.400]   But if an investment, if I can easily understand how somebody makes money, I can
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   easily understand my downside.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.360]   I get why I would make money.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.680]   And I think there's a reasonable expectation that I will make money.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.120]   And my downside is not that high.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.640]   I think that's why I like farmland.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.960]   It's just it's easy.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.440]   It's straightforward. It's simple.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.040]   It's one that even though so many investors have gone to the last few years, I
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.360]   still don't see the rush there like I have in residential real estate.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.720]   And it's completely the opposite of what's going to happen in commercial real
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.560]   estate. Commercial real estate is it has to have a transformation now.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   And I don't think I don't think a lot of people, definitely people above my pay
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   grade, are figuring that out today as we speak.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.160]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.720]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.440]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.520]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.720]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.960]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.000]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.840]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.240]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.760]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.400]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.800]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.480]   massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.120]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.520]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.480]   found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.480]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.400]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.760]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.000]   When your projects get more complex, finding what you're looking for across your
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.200]   entire workspace gets so much harder.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   That's where Notion Q&A comes in.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.560]   It answers any question you have, making use of your entire database of knowledge
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.920]   to make sure the answers are actually helpful.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.840]   If you're not familiar, Notion is an amazing product that combines your notes,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.080]   docs, and projects all together in one beautiful space.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.560]   And with Q&A, Notion AI can now give you instant answers to your questions using

[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.960]   I've used it to find information from old notes, answer questions about a marketing
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.840]   plan, or even find my upcoming travel details.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.200]   All in seconds.

[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   you can find exactly what you need without leaving the page you're on.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.680]   I love the features Notion keeps shipping and it just reinforces our decision to use
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.080]   it as the central place we manage our life and work.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.560]   It also makes me even more excited to be partnering with them for this episode.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.640]   So when you talk to most people about investments, they'll say you got to
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.240]   diversify as much as possible.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.320]   And one of the contrarian opinions in the book is that the key to becoming
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.760]   wealthy is to strategically undiversify.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.080]   Can you unpack that?
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.560]   And the reason I write about this is because it's what everybody wants their
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.040]   advisor to do, and being a guy that was an advisor for a long time, they want
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.240]   advisors to make them rich.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.160]   Let's be clear, a fiduciary financial advisor will never tell you how to get
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.760]   rich with money.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   They won't.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.000]   They'll show you how to diversify your money for two reasons.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.560]   Number one, they know that your number one way of becoming wealthy is actually
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.280]   keeping an income stream that adds to investments that beat inflation.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.880]   So if they can help you figure out the behaviors to continue to put more money
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.800]   in, and then they can diversify, usually into something that mimics the indexes,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   right, and keep you close to the efficient frontier.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   What I'm saying, Chris, is that what a certified financial planner is going to
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.760]   tell you is boring is good, but sexy is not where you want to be.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.520]   Boring is good.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.880]   And doing the other thing is great, but I'm not a financial planner anymore.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.840]   So I get it.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.080]   And by the way, the other thing is think about what can go wrong with strategic
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.040]   under-diversification.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.960]   If you are wrong, what we're going to do here is do something called increased
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.080]   standard deviation.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.520]   So let's take standard deviation.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.720]   Standard deviation is the wiggle in your portfolio.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.080]   And when people used to come into my office and we would build a portfolio
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   together and we determine what indexes we're going to mimic and how we're going
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.160]   to put the portfolio together, I would then run the software to show you the
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.080]   standard deviation on that portfolio.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.800]   And if you look at one standard deviation either way, I'll tell you, Chris, for you
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.320]   and your family, this historically we're aiming for eight and a half percent after
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.720]   tax.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   We're aiming for an eight and a half percent rate of return.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.560]   That's what we're getting.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.440]   Now, here's the good news is one standard deviation and we're not going to go into
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.400]   all that, but in most years we can have 14 percent above that and it's still a
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.040]   normal year.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.480]   That's fantastic.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.960]   We could also have 10 percent below that and it's still going to be in the range
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.400]   of expected results and we're going to be okay.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.120]   If we get that wiggle, which is what we expect with this portfolio, we're going to
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.800]   be okay.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.680]   And it's like a weather report or it's the pilot of the plane who tells you you
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.240]   put in the fastened seatbelt sign on because it's going to be a bumpy ride, like
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.960]   looking ahead.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.640]   I love standard deviation because it's a look ahead on what I can expect from this
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.200]   investment.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.600]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:37.920]   When you saw the last couple of years, the market dropped 14 percent, 14 percent for
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.680]   the S&P 500 is within that first standard deviation, meaning that's a normal day.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.440]   That's actually a normal time.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.760]   It's not a bear market.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.080]   And what's going on CNBC and Fox Business, they're freaking out.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.120]   They're freaking out.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.920]   We're going to bet that things are tailspinning.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.520]   No, they're not.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.080]   This is just pretty bumpy day on the ride.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.760]   So what we do to strategically under diversify is we increase standard
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.000]   deviation, which means our upside potential gets higher.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.960]   But you also have to remember, Chris, then what does that do to the downside?
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.000]   We're also taking on a lot more risk.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   And to give an example of how this is work for people, Dave Ramsey, my buddy Dave in
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:25.720]   Tennessee, tells his followers to invest in actively managed mutual funds, usually
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.640]   through a company called American Funds.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   And that's what he advocates.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.200]   Dave is a hugely wealthy person, just monster wealthy, wealthy, built a huge
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.840]   company, lives in this monster house, has a gigantic net worth.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.080]   Dave did not get wealthy following Dave's advice.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.160]   Dave didn't diversify a bunch of mutual funds.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.240]   Dave tried twice.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.960]   The first time he bought some real estate properties and he went bankrupt.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.920]   So he increased standard deviation through real estate and he went bankrupt doing
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.040]   it, owed people a bunch of money.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.480]   Then he came back, right?
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.280]   This is Dave's story.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.880]   Dave comes back and he builds a company telling people not to do that.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.760]   And he made money not owning a diversified collection of stuff, but by owning one
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.320]   company, one thing.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.720]   That's how Dave got rich.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:17.640]   So if you're really interested in being wealthy, find something that's good, make
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.000]   sure it doesn't stink.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.400]   Make sure that it's going to actually do what you hope it does.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.440]   And you're going to get wealthy a lot faster.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.160]   The bad news is you're going to get poor a lot faster if it doesn't go the way that
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.440]   you want.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.000]   And like you said earlier, focus on something you know about, you care about.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.600]   You can pour your heart and soul into not some random thing that someone told you at
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.920]   a party.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.160]   Jason Zweig, who's a phenomenal writer in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:51.080]   ago, was talking about a gentleman who has been managing money since the mid 1970s.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.280]   And he's only given five interviews during his career.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   He's stepping down from managing money.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.600]   And Jason talks about the key to his success.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.400]   He owns very few companies.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.320]   He doesn't waste a lot of time on the top of the funnel like we talked about earlier,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.920]   dealing with FOMO and all these different ideas.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.960]   He owns just a few companies and he spends 90% of his time understanding the heartbeat
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.520]   of those companies explicitly.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.320]   He knows everything about these companies.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.080]   It sounds like you got to make good decisions and stick to them, which you said the
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.920]   value of hiring an advisor is about helping you make good decisions.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.040]   A question I've gotten a few times from listeners is how do you make the decision to
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.720]   hire an advisor?
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.680]   When does it make sense?
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.800]   How do you interview them?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.080]   You've been one for over a decade.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.760]   Now you're not one and you can give whatever advice you want.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.000]   How would you answer that question to people?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.400]   And I want to be careful here because I've been told by people that because I was a
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.720]   financial advisor, people all of a sudden think that I'm going to have a bias toward
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.000]   them.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.200]   And so when I talk about advisors, I want to just warn everybody ahead of time that I
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.080]   think differently about advisors, I think, than most people do.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.880]   And when people fire their advisors, I generally think that is a good thing to fire
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.920]   your advisors.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.600]   And it's mostly Chris because they have the wrong relationship with their advisor.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.200]   I think so.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.400]   With that preamble, let me lay this out.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.880]   I think we all need advisors.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.400]   Everybody need advisors.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:23.720]   I need somebody who's not me, who's not emotional about my stuff, who I know has my
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:30.760]   back and who is going to give me some good ideas and tell me where I'm stepping in it.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.120]   What's cool is that Walt Disney, back when he was creating Disneyland, and this was,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.320]   think about Disneyland at the time, the thing that he was competing against were these
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.520]   fairs that went, these garbage fairs that went from place to place and carnivals were
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.960]   known as dirty and dirty people that work there and sketchy environment in a lot of
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.440]   cases.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.120]   He's trying to create this clean family, something that's differentiating from that.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.760]   But he still was a pioneer going in this new direction.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.400]   So a great story about Walt Disney was he would often wear a disguise where he's
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.680]   wearing a hat or a hat and a wig or some sunglasses and he'd walk around the park and
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.000]   he'd stand in lines and he'd fire up a conversation with people in line with him
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.040]   and go, "Hey, what do you think about this ride?
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.560]   What do you think?
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.520]   What have you heard about it?
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.720]   Is it, do you think it's as good?
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.920]   Man, I've been thinking about some things that this park could have that it doesn't
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.200]   have.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.320]   What could this park have?"
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.800]   He's looking for advice all over the place.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.080]   And for him, it was hard to give Walt Disney advice.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.600]   I've read a lot about Walt and he was very opinionated and it was hard to look him in
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.160]   the eye and say, "I think you're messing up."
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.000]   But he craved that.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.320]   And I think we should all crave that.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.080]   I think too often we get defensive and instead we should be asking ourselves, "Where
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.240]   am I messing this up?"
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.040]   If I ask more often, I have that growth mindset, "Where am I messing this up?
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.080]   I think I'm going to do a better job."
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.320]   So even if I'm just starting out, Chris, I want to take wealthy people that have
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.960]   already been where I want to go.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.600]   I want to take them to lunch.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.120]   I want to pick their brain.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.880]   I want to put them on my board of directors.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.320]   And the reason I like people firing advisors is because if you've an advisory
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:14.040]   relationship where you have abdicated the throne and they're doing it for you instead
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.720]   of advising you and how you won't step in it and how to do a better job, you have the
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   wrong relationship.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.960]   And to give you an idea, everybody talks about Tesla.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:29.920]   I'm actually, as a Detroit guy, I'm a fan and I groan sometimes, but I am a fan of
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.520]   General Motors. I'm a fan of Mary Barra and the job that she's done, taking this
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.040]   legacy organization and trying to make them competitive.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.600]   And I watch that because that's a huge struggle for the whole city.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.600]   But Mary doesn't not show up at work, Chris.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.200]   She doesn't show up at work.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.760]   She doesn't go, "Hey, OK, I'm going to meet with you twice a year about these cars
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.280]   we're making and I'm going to go do something else," which is what people do with
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.400]   their financial advisors.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.880]   No, Mary goes to all the meetings.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.680]   She knows everything about a car.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.600]   I just went to this thing, Camp Phi, which was awesome.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.560]   She goes to the camp outs and meets with other people that are car enthusiasts.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.480]   She goes to the engineering meetings.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.600]   She talks the talk about unions and pay scale and economics and what's selling and
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.720]   what's hot, what's new.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.600]   What's the day? She goes to everything.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.320]   But then what does she do? She surrounds herself with these phenomenal engineers and
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.720]   vice presidents who are smarter than she is about every aspect of the car.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.120]   And that, I think, is what we want in our life.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.560]   So my standpoint, in the most long way possible, I think we should all have advisors.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.440]   I really, it is less dangerous to hire a CFP.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.200]   But as you can tell by my explanation of what an advisor is and what advisor isn't, I
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.280]   actually don't really care.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.360]   Hire people that, you know, have your back.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.280]   We say hire a CFP and hire a fiduciary.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:56.120]   Why is that? Number one, a CFP is somebody who I know has this depth of knowledge about
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.000]   the things that go on in creating a financial plan.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.600]   That's good. I want that.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   The second thing I know about some CFPs is they are this thing called a fiduciary, which
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.480]   means they are required to do what they think is in my best interest.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.840]   I want all my advisors to be fiduciaries.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.880]   So those two things, if you're checking boxes, yes, ask those.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.320]   But more important, I'm really just looking, what is my fit?
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.800]   What is your expertise?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.320]   How do you make me go faster?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.680]   How do you make me smarter?
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.240]   How do you involve me in the process so that I can still do other things and still be
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.640]   involved in what we're trying to create together?
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.960]   That's who I'm looking for as advisors.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.520]   And what about on the execution side?
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   Do you think it makes sense to hire someone to rebalance your accounts and tax loss
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.600]   harvest and that kind of stuff?
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.880]   That's not really advice as much as execution.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.480]   Doesn't matter at that point.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.600]   Right. That's not advice.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.800]   That's delegation.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.400]   Do you want to hire a team to do that?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.320]   Do you want to hire asset managers to manage the asset for you to hold them?
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.280]   Maybe. It depends on what your if you start with your end and where you're trying to go
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.520]   and work backward, you'll make some great decisions on whether what you delegate and
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.200]   what you keep.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.800]   Just realize this, that I had a family member die recently.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   And the thing that we always try to optimize is our money.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.200]   And the thing I don't think we optimize enough is our time.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.520]   And it made me realize yesterday that you don't know when the story is going to end
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.640]   and don't waste your time doing tasks that are below your pay grade.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.560]   And by pay grade, I don't mean a money amount, meaning stuff that you really don't
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.400]   value that aren't going to give you that richness that we're all looking for.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.120]   Delegate that crap.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.680]   Delegate as much of it as you can.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.640]   But be involved to know how the decisions get made.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.400]   Absolutely. Don't abdicate.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   And I love it when I hear, Chris, people fire their advisors.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.160]   They're like, I just fired my financial advisor.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.480]   And generally, I think that's a good thing if you're trying to reinsert yourself in the
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.840]   process because you made this mistake of being in a relationship where you just handed
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.320]   over the keys to the kingdom.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.360]   You don't want to do that.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.560]   Okay. This is going to be a bit of a hard turn, but it's something that I thought was
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.880]   really interesting in the book.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.120]   Maybe we should have started here because it's a far more first step thing.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.840]   We talk, you talk about emergency funds.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.120]   And the reason I want to bring this up is I have always looked at the emergency fund
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.240]   and thought, okay, I could leave a couple months of cash somewhere.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.160]   And the argument was always you might lose your job.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.480]   You might need to pay for an expensive medical bill.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.120]   And those are all fine.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   And those are good reasons to hold emergency funds.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.760]   There are a few things you put on there that kind of made it seem like an emergency fund
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.440]   could be a hack to save you money.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:44.880]   And I would love to talk about them because I've always seen the emergency fund as this
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.360]   boring thing that costs you.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.920]   Right. It's cash that's sitting somewhere and not earning.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.440]   But you pointed out things like raising the deductibles on your policies because you have
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.040]   this emergency fund, which saves you money each month.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.880]   Can you talk a bit about some of the things that you think make emergency funds
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.560]   financially beneficial beyond just paying for emergencies that might arise?
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.440]   Yeah. Insurance companies want to talk about buying insurance and you don't want to
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:14.840]   have that discussion. The discussion you and I want to have as owners of our, you know,
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.400]   personal business, which is our life is our business.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   We want to think about risk management.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.200]   And even we talked about portfolio building.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.600]   We talked about risk management, right?
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.840]   What can go wrong? So the first thing I want to ask is not what insurances should I buy?
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.120]   It is what could go wrong and then how do I meet that?
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.160]   And for most of us, once you build an emergency fund, it can save you, to your point,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.560]   Chris, so much money and not just insurances.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.840]   I'll tell you in another way, the when you build that fund, you can then self-insure that
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.040]   you can meet it because you have cash in the bank.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.640]   Why would I hire an insurance company to do something that may also be a low risk?
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.520]   So I look at the risk of it happening versus the amount of money that I'm paying for it.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.800]   Now, give me an example here.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.920]   When we look at our homeowners and our car insurance, which of those insurances cost
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.280]   more? For most of us, it's your car insurance costs more.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.160]   But which asset for most of us costs more?
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.840]   If you're maybe for some of us, our car costs more than our house.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.400]   But I think for most of us, if we own a house, our house costs more than our car.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.120]   But insuring, it's all a lot less.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.520]   Why is that?
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.240]   A house has a bigger magnitude, the magnitude of the loss will be bigger.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.840]   The chance of the loss is much, much smaller.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.560]   I believe the numbers are for car insurance, I think it's one in three hundred.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.040]   And for homeowners insurance, it's about one in twelve hundred.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.600]   And those are stats off the top of my head.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:45.400]   But whenever you look at what the insurance company is offering, I always look at what's
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.480]   the pricing on these different policies.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.200]   And this is a mind shift for most people.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.280]   I want to focus not on insurance, but I want to focus on those issues that actuaries have
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.160]   told me are expensive by jacking up the price on insurances.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.880]   And I want to have a great strategy in those areas.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.320]   And if it's something that they're valuing very cheap, I know that the risk of that
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.480]   happening is not as big and I don't need to focus on it.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.960]   So is it so for car insurance and for homeowners?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.840]   I can know I have this opportunity to have a low deductible or a high deductible.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   That's the amount you're going to pay first before you have a claim.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.600]   So make sure your experience is good before you do this.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.640]   But if you have an emergency fund, you can jack up the deductible and you save yourself
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.520]   a bunch of money because you're going to self-insure.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.480]   And you're not saying self-insure the entire loss.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.000]   No.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.480]   You're just saying self-insure against needing a low deductible.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.600]   Exactly.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.920]   Self-insure the first thousand dollars or the first 10 percent or whatever that might
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.760]   be. Self-insure that minimal thing and insure the catastrophic stuff, right?
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.040]   The stuff that's going to sink your financial plan, insure all that.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.560]   Disability is another one.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.480]   Keep long-term disability insurance in place.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.680]   But short-term disability insurance, which is super expensive because you're going to
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.640]   use that first, the first maybe six months.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.400]   If you get to the point that you have six months of expenses in an emergency fund, I
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.200]   don't have to buy short-term disability.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.640]   I can use that emergency fund now to do it.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   And I've avoided a huge expense.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   And by the way, something that statistically happens to a lot of people at the same
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.800]   time. There's another thing that I said that where you also save money.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:28.640]   I see people freak out about their investment strategy, especially people that tell me
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.680]   that they have a high risk tolerance, but they've never seen a downturn.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.920]   And there are, as you know, Chris, a lot of people listening to the show who started
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.200]   investing in 2008, 2009.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.360]   Right. And all they've seen is this roaring up market.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.960]   They haven't been through 2007 in the early days of 2008.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.760]   They haven't been through 2000 to 2002, which is when I lost all my hair.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.480]   Those times you act a hell of a lot differently than you think that you will.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.000]   And I'll give you an example. People say, oh, I can deal with a 25 percent loss.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.360]   That sounds fine. Let's say your portfolio is a million dollars.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.320]   Let's put that in dollar numbers.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.640]   If you and I are sitting across the table from each other and I say you lost a quarter
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.560]   of a million dollars in the last three weeks.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.720]   You're going to act differently.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.160]   You're not going to act like 25 percent doesn't mean anything to my brain.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.200]   A quarter of a million dollars sounds absolutely horrible.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.320]   So when you take these and you put real numbers on them, I saw people as an advisor
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.760]   do all kinds of bad stuff.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.160]   But this is where an emergency fund comes through.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.120]   Yeah. A lot of people say your emergency fund's not earning anything.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.720]   But then I thought about pet insurance and I thought, oh, I've set aside enough money
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.440]   in my emergency fund to cover if anything goes wrong.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.000]   And pet insurance, you know, could be 50, 60, 70 bucks a month.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.600]   I don't actually remember the exact amount.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.240]   But what my emergency fund is earning is not paying that pet insurance each month.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.800]   So in a way, if you think about it from that perspective, it actually is earning
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.840]   interest, but it's earning interest in the form of not forcing you to pay for these
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.920]   things that you otherwise would have maybe paid because you don't want to have to
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.400]   sell your portfolio to pay for your pet surgery or something like that.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.880]   Emergencies you don't have to meet and also bad decisions that you can avoid.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   Yeah. Now, part of that, you talked about insurance, and I think you've talked to me
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   about in the past different ways to hack insurance and some tips and tricks.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.000]   Disability is where you started.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.080]   I know very few people I know have ever talked about disability insurance.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.760]   Lots of people talk about life insurance.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.720]   I know some employers cover it.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.960]   I don't actually know if employers usually cover enough.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.120]   But in the book, you kind of talked about disability insurance as this thing that a
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.200]   lot of people overlook.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.240]   Is it something more people need to be looking at?
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.040]   Is it only for people who aren't employed or how do you advise people to think about
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.520]   it? No, it's the number one insurance that that I think that we need.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   And it's the number one thing we don't want to talk about.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.440]   We think we're pretty safe people.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.360]   We're safe skiers. And it's not about you.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.600]   And if you look at how expensive it is, actuaries have figured out that the chance of
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.760]   it happening to you is better than you think.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.400]   By the way, the number one reason people default on their home loan and most people
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.720]   don't know this. It's not that somebody is a deadbeat and they just stop paying their
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.760]   mortgage. It's actually a disability.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.480]   A disability happens, all of a sudden they can't make the mortgage payment, default on
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.760]   the loan and they're out of their house.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.320]   So disability insurance is huge.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.720]   If you have it through work, look at that policy first.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.200]   The problem with workplace policies is that they often have a cap.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:41.080]   So in other words, they'll say, we will, Chris, give you 65% of what you earn, but
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:46.000]   we're going to cap it at $3,000 a month, which for many people listening to this show
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.880]   isn't 65% of what they earn.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.760]   They may earn north of that.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.960]   And so it really is a $3,000 a month policy.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:00.720]   On top of that amount, that money also, if it's taken out as a pre-tax deduction, it's
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.640]   also going to be taxed. Now we're really getting in the weeds.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   So you're not actually getting all that money either.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.040]   If you buy a policy on your own, it's generally going to be used with after-tax
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.880]   dollars, which means that the benefit will be tax-free when you receive it.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.680]   So it's an expensive insurance.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.200]   People should get it.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.960]   But start off with, what do I need, right?
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.840]   What's my need?
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.760]   And then work backward.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.880]   What do I have through work?
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.240]   Watch out for the cap and then go buy extra.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.920]   So when I see that Aflac duck commercial, the emergency insurance, I'm the guy going,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.240]   yeah, yeah, directionally that's, and that's not an Aflac commercial.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.040]   I'm just saying that's what the Aflac people are talking about.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.720]   And people should start investigating that.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.680]   And it's the same, by the way, it's the same when people are retired.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.280]   The number one threat to your long retirement is long-term care, that we're going to
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.120]   have this catastrophic illness there.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.480]   The long-term care insurance is a bloodbath.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   It is so ugly that, frankly, we're at this spot where OG, who's a working CFP still on
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.920]   our show, he and I commiserate, Chris, we don't know what to do.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.880]   We know you need a plan because it's the A number one threat, but buying long-term
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:15.120]   care insurance is just, the cost benefit is so tough and you have to dedicate so many
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.600]   assets to it that it really drives me crazy.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.360]   It's a conundrum you see a lot of CFPs talking about right now.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   What do we do in the case of long-term care?
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.960]   And really, I don't have a great answer.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.800]   How about that?
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.960]   None of the hacks.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   We should recall that part of the show, none of the hacks.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.320]   Well, you had a good one for homeowner's insurance, which I loved, which I've never
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.600]   had a homeowner's claim and I believe you have.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.240]   Can you talk about what happens when you get that claim and how you can
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   make it go a lot better?
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.520]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.720]   Some of this stuff, unfortunately, I play tested.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:52.120]   Like there was a time when I was a nomad in the middle of my life and I play tested
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.320]   what we told people for a long time, which is try your financial independence dream
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:56.880]   ahead of time.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.960]   But unfortunately, I also tried out my homeowner's coverage and I've been telling
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.840]   people for a long time to take pictures of your house, take a video, just go around
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.000]   your house with your phone, take a video, go open drawers.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.840]   You can cruise through rooms at a fairly quick rate and just look at everything.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.400]   Because my experience and most people's experience, if you're working with a good
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.880]   insurance company and most of them are fine, they will ask you, they gave me, Chris,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.280]   they gave me a blank sheet and they said, what's in your house?
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.760]   What did you have?
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   Our house got robbed.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.920]   Okay, house got robbed.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.080]   Thank you.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.800]   Sorry, I missed that key point.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.760]   Our house got robbed.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.360]   We were in Chicago on vacation.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.320]   Our house was here in Texarkana, Texas.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.200]   And we had a neighbor called that said they came over to check on our cat and my front
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.920]   door was open and it clearly been somebody had taken some tools to my front door and
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.040]   it had ripped it open.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.600]   And for who knows what reason, they were able to disable my not that great, apparently
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.920]   security system at the time and and they took stuff.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.480]   And luckily, we had taken video of our house.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.640]   There was a second thing there, too, though, that was wild, which is for some of the
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:15.000]   electronics that we had, they said, do you have the serial number of your televisions?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.480]   Because if you have your serial number, here's what's usually going to happen.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.520]   They're going to take it to a pawn shop and they're going to try to get some money for
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.240]   it. But if you have the serial number, when they turn that in, we've got them.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.400]   Like we've I still I took the video.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.520]   I didn't have my serial numbers.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.480]   When you buy high priced electronics, just have a place where you put down all the
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.840]   security, all the serial numbers of your things.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.760]   And would they not reimburse you if you didn't have the serial number?
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.560]   They did. They actually still did what I mind did.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.440]   I had a great insurance company that I was working with and they reimbursed me for my
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.720]   I had two computers stolen.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.000]   I had an Xbox stolen.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.120]   I had two television stolen.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.800]   We had some jewelry that was worth nothing to anybody except my spouse.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.480]   And that was really sad because some of it was heirloom stuff.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   We had some art stolen that was expensive.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.520]   That stuff I had not had appraised.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.760]   And because I hadn't had it appraised and had it added to the policy, we had had some
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.520]   other things added to the policy.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   Luckily, Cher was wearing an expensive ring that she had.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.440]   She'd taken it with her.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.280]   So that one we had separate as itemized on the policy.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.240]   But but yeah, make a quick video because for a lot of stuff they sold, they reimbursed
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.000]   me. I just had to know what I had and think about that.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.400]   If your house burns down, it's going to be the same thing.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.800]   But if your house burnt down today and they gave you a blank sheet of paper and they
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.440]   said, Chris, what's all the stuff you owned?
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.240]   I don't know where to start.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.800]   Yeah, I get a quarter of it.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.240]   I wouldn't get a quarter of it.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.560]   And I don't think I own that much, but I still wouldn't get that wouldn't get that
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   much. So, yeah, that's a great hack.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.840]   Yeah. If there's one thing you do after listening to this, walk through your house,
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.920]   make your own, as you said in the book, like your own MTV Cribs, treat it like a fun
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.520]   thing and save save a record of everything you own.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.200]   And I guess if you have serial numbers, do that also.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.320]   But yeah, I wouldn't even I don't even know if I would get a quarter of the stuff.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.120]   It's just there's jackets that you'd forget.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.400]   And it would be so easy to just take a video.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.320]   And the quality of most videos now is so good.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.280]   If we did this 20, 30 years ago, it's like, well, there's some clothes in the closet.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.800]   But in most cases, we just need something to spur our memory.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.200]   You go, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.440]   In that corner, there was that thing and this other thing.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.040]   And yeah.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.720]   Yeah. Love it.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.800]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.720]   Research shows that if you're like 90 percent of Americans, you most likely have
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   money anxiety.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.840]   In fact, that is one of the reasons I started a financial planning firm back in
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840]   2016.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.440]   And when we shut the company down, we did extensive research on the financial
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.920]   service company we wanted to recommend to our clients.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.600]   And we landed on Facet.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.960]   And I'm excited they're sponsoring today's episode.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.760]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry on its head, making financial
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.960]   planning accessible to everyone, not just the most wealthy.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.720]   And one of the things I hated about this industry is that so many financial
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.880]   advisors charge based on a high percentage of your assets, but not Facet.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.680]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee, which means you actually keep more
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   of what you invest.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.360]   And they match you with your own CFP professional who uses industry-leading
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.680]   technology and is backed by a team of experts across investments, taxes, and
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   more.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:30.000]   So tackle the uncertainty you're feeling about your finances and replace it with
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.680]   some real confidence about your money.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.560]   Go to allthehacks.com/facet.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.480]   That's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.640]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way and they'll even waive the $250
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.200]   enrollment fee for all of you.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet, F-A-C-E-T.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.200]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.800]   Facet Wealth is an SEC-registered investment advisor.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.280]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities, nor is it investment, legal,
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.120]   or tax advice.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.840]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.400]   Terms and conditions may apply.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:07.400]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.520]   up your cooking at home?
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.040]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.360]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.640]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.800]   microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.160]   partner with them for this episode.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.520]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.840]   scratch in the microwave, and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.720]   code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.800]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.480]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.280]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.520]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.560]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.960]   It is so good.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.440]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black IO collection they launched
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.520]   last year, you have to check it out.

[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.280]   Before we go, we've hit a lot.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.320]   I do want to tackle a few questions that I've gotten from listeners that I feel
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.680]   like who better than a former CFP and snarky podcast host to help answer these
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.240]   questions.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.520]   We answered one about financial advisors and how to think about it.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.840]   One that I wanted to know if you had any tips for someone said, you know, I'm
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.800]   kind of new to investing.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   I started investing.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.000]   Taxes are a little bit more, it's not an employer thing as easy where it's
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.560]   just so obvious they withhold.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.520]   What, what does someone investing need to know about taxes?
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.600]   And are there any tricks?
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.760]   You do need to know a bunch about taxes, but really knowing the basics.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.640]   If you start off with the basics, taxes are way more easier than you think.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.560]   What I would recommend that everybody does, and I actually had a tax expert.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.760]   We talked about advisors.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:24.320]   One of my best advisors was a CPA who sat me down and told me about how taxes
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:24.480]   work.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.880]   You know what they did first, Chris?
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:31.960]   They had me read with them just the 1040 form and the itemized deduction form.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.240]   And the itemized deduction form does not apply to as many people as it used to
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.120]   because of some tax reform a couple of years ago.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:43.200]   But still, once you understand how the 1040 is laid out, believe it or not,
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.320]   you're going to find opportunities much more quickly.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.800]   And it's like riding a bike.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.200]   Once you read it once and you understand it once, you'll understand why a credit
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.680]   beats a deduction.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:59.000]   You'll also understand where any write-offs you can do work, how tax loss
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.120]   harvesting works.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.040]   You'll also understand why using an HSA is kick-ass.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:11.440]   And an FSA, if you can use an FSA and you have a good budget, can also work for
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:11.560]   you.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.280]   FSA is a little different than an HSA.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.120]   You use it or lose it.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:19.800]   There's some exceptions around COVID right now, but in an average year with an FSA,
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.960]   you're going to use it or lose it.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.760]   Yeah, totally agree on the FSA.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.560]   If you're listening and you don't subscribe to the All The Hacks newsletter, we
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.600]   actually did a whole thing maybe a week or two ago about FSAs and a whole bunch of
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.640]   other year-end tax tips, tax loss harvesting, what to do there and all that good
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:35.960]   stuff.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.520]   So if you're not a subscriber to that, go check it out.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.040]   And I'm sure, Chris, you went over this in the newsletter, but I will say one thing.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.920]   There was a headline we did this year.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.760]   We have a headline segment in our show and there was a guy who is actually a
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:54.600]   professional who was trading GME, like a lot of people were, and he kept getting in
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.040]   and out and in and out and in and out.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.800]   And he didn't realize wash sale rules mean that if it's not in an IRA, when you
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.600]   sell something, you got to stay out for 30 days to be able to claim it on your taxes.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:12.200]   Wash sale rule is an easy thing once you know it, but it's also this speed bump that
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.040]   a lot of people get wrong.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.680]   So the main takeaways, and Cody, thanks for sending this question in, we didn't even
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.360]   hit the basics.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.800]   It's just, if you're investing and you hold something for a year, you get preferential
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.280]   tax treatment, but like Joe said, anytime you sell or buy something, if you do the
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.680]   same thing within 30 days, it can really mess you up.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.840]   Um, so keep an eye on that and you do have to hold the money for taxes.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.560]   So if you have a big gain in early in the year, that money that you're going to owe
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.520]   in April, the following year, you can't go spend it.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.560]   I have a horrible story from someone I worked with who played the crypto game.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:54.120]   And in, I want to say it was like 2017, they made like $800,000 on crypto and they took
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.400]   all their earnings.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.720]   And in 2018, the following year, they went and invested in some other crazy crypto
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.760]   thing and lost it all.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:07.680]   And when it came time to file their 2017 taxes, they didn't have the money to pay the
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.200]   bill.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.480]   And you can't use a future year.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.400]   You can't say, well, no, no, no, I lost the money later.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.000]   So they, I don't, I never heard the resolution, but that was either a, you know,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.040]   negotiate with the IRS or file for bankruptcy kind of thing.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.640]   So if you sell anything and have a gain, take the money you're going to owe the IRS,
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.600]   put it in a separate account and ignore it because you need that money next year.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.720]   And there's not a lot of options if you don't have it.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.640]   Oh, that's just, yeah.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.280]   And I'm betting where they ended up was a payment plan.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   I'm sure they probably ended up in a, I would do a payment plan way before bankruptcy
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.840]   there. But Chris, I thought of one more that people are still listening to this in the
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.200]   last couple of days of this year.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.160]   That is super important.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.800]   We think that the Backdoor Roth IRA might go away.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:59.280]   I would make sure if you have, if you're doing a conversion and talk to your team that
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.000]   you've set up that we talked about earlier about whether you're doing conversions or
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.160]   not, man, if you're doing Backdoor Roth IRAs, I would, I'd make sure you do it this
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.160]   year because it might be bye bye.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.160]   Yeah. Yeah. One of the items on the list is Backdoor Roth.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.840]   So check that out.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.920]   And the same goes for Roth conversions.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.760]   If you have a lot of traditional IRA assets, I mean, you're in a low tax year.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.480]   It could make sense to roll them all over to a Roth.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.040]   You'll take a little bit of a tax hit this year, but you won't pay taxes in the future.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.120]   So get it done.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:29.720]   Amen.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.120]   One more.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:35.600]   Jeff asks what to do and how to hack and how to optimize for aging parents.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.240]   A lot of us are going to be in a circumstance where our parents, if they're still
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.680]   around, you know, might not have everything they need.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.920]   We might need to take care of them.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.680]   We might even, they might have everything they need, but we might need to help them
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.160]   with money.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.800]   It's not as easy as our friends where we're like, oh, just go get a robo advisor and
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.960]   think about it in 40 years.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.520]   And any advice for someone whose parents are aging and don't have their finances in
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:55.880]   order?
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:01.240]   The first thing that I would worry about, Chris, is I would worry about talking to your
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.960]   parents the right way because your parents knew you way back when.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.760]   And I remember I've been a financial planner for 10 years.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.880]   My practice was very successful.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.800]   And I remember my dad 10 years in saying, so this financial planning thing, you think
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.760]   you're still going to do it?
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.360]   Like you think you're going to stick with us?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.800]   Dad, I think it's, I think it's going to go okay.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.040]   It's feeding my family.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.880]   I think we're doing fine.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:26.200]   But so your parents have a different outlook about you and they're going to take your
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.480]   advice differently.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.680]   And they may also feel like you're pressuring them and you don't want to do that.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.280]   They may also wonder what your agenda is, depending on your family dynamic.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.600]   I will point people to another book, which is written by a woman named Cameron
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.080]   Huddleston.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.240]   You know, Cameron, Chris?
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:43.600]   No.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.640]   Cameron Huddleston wrote a great book about talking to elders about their money,
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.440]   talking to your parents about their money.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.280]   And I believe the book is called Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.960]   And it is a fantastic book about all the things that can go wrong in those
[00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.720]   discussions.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.680]   But, but to begin that discussion in the right way is really important.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.200]   And one hack that she shared with me is that often your parents don't want you
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.600]   button into their money, especially parents of a certain generation.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.720]   They might be very private.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:19.080]   If they are private, if you start off with a little oversharing on your part about
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.600]   what you're doing, they may then reciprocate.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   I used to read these great books, these detective books that were written about
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.880]   the Navajo nation, which were fantastic.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.080]   And this detective in the book was a guy named Joe Leaphorn.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.000]   And when I was a financial planner, I would use the Joe Leaphorn rule of getting
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.320]   more out of people than I probably deserved.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.920]   And what I would do that Joe Leaphorn did was I'd share a little bit about me that
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   was maybe a little oversharing.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.360]   And in almost every case, Chris, the person across the table from me would also then
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.920]   share something on their end that they weren't supposed to share that might be a
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.840]   little extra with parents, especially just say, Hey, you know what, I've really been
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.240]   thinking about like how I manage my money the next 10 years.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.320]   And here's what I was thinking for the next 10, 15 years that this would go, you
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.480]   know, that I do this, I do this, I do this.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.440]   And then they'll share, well, I was thinking about, I'm doing this and this
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.760]   thing, and now we have an in to start talking about their money and you still
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.920]   preserve the parent child relationship where in the big scope of things, they're
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.120]   also giving you advice.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.800]   One more thing, still with older people, solve for when they're going to spend the
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.120]   money. A big mistake that I find, Chris, is that people go, and I'm going to just
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.000]   throw this out there.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.680]   They're going to say, let's say that you think that crypto is a great idea and you
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.760]   go not with grandma's money, right?
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.920]   I'll tell you that if grandma is never going to spend that money and it's going to
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:57.640]   go in a glad bag with all the other estate stuff and go to the child, you think
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.080]   about when that money is going to be spent.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.480]   If the money is never going to be spent and the money is an asset that's meant for a
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.880]   child to maybe spend, grandma taking risks is not always a bad thing.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.840]   If you start with the end in mind.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.000]   I've seen lawsuits, which I always wonder about.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.840]   I wonder about some third party family member coming into a situation going, oh my
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.200]   God, my grandma owns a growth stock.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.560]   Grandma doesn't buy green bananas.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.120]   Like, why are we buying something that's as volatile as a growth stock?
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.400]   It might be because grandma has a team of people she's working with and grandma's not
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.720]   thinking about her lifetime.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.640]   She's thinking about this is money that in my trust is going to go to my grandkids.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   My grandkids are now three and this is money that's going to be spent 15 years from
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.840]   now. So even with grandma, don't think about end of life.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.960]   Think about when that crop needs to be harvested.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.760]   Yeah, that's great advice.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.000]   Last one is from John and this is a fun one.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   He wanted to understand leverage in a portfolio.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.360]   Right. And it was interesting.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.960]   He said, you know, I move around a lot.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.160]   Buying a house is not something interesting, but it seems like everyone who buys a
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.400]   house takes out a mortgage and gets this great leverage where you put 20 percent down
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.040]   on an asset that can appreciate.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.680]   And if that asset appreciates, you get the appreciation from the whole asset and you
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.000]   only put down 20 percent.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.520]   Yeah. So what role does leverage have for someone who's not buying a house?
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   Oh, great question, because leverage magnifies everything, which means it's going to
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.200]   go hella good.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.040]   It's going to go so much better when times are good, but it's also going to unravel
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:39.920]   more quickly. So what wealthy people know is that they are predisposed.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.000]   And I've seen so many studies on this.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.760]   Most wealthy people are predisposed to not using leverage, except in very strategic
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.160]   cases. So I'll give you an example.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.560]   Interest rate on your mortgage.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.400]   Very low. If you've got a pot of money sitting in a bank account where you can pay
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.560]   the mortgage off right now and it's not going to mess with your psyche, not paying it
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:09.160]   off. Why would I take money that's earning in an eye behind earning over 7 percent and
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.360]   put it down on a house with a mortgage that's at two and a half?
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.120]   I shouldn't do that. Now what I might do is if there's a way and there's not with an eye
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.520]   bond, but taking money out of my investment portfolio every month and have it pay that
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.840]   monthly bill. So I just have freedom from worry and the pile of money can pay it.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.760]   That's a great use of leverage.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.800]   I'm using interest rate arbitrage between those two positions.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.080]   But I start off from a place of it's incredibly dangerous and I don't want to use it
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.920]   unless I have completely thought through not while this looks like a great opportunity,
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.040]   but if the walls come crashing down, how is this going to look?
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.560]   And I'll give you an old guy story.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.080]   Real estate right now, we talked about earlier about how there's so many shysters in
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.880]   real estate. The reason Chris is that the real estate market's been, it's easy to be an
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.160]   expert. So there's tons of experts out there.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.600]   And the reason why they're making money hand over fist is because of exactly what he's
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.480]   saying, that because people are using mortgages, they're not creating stock market
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.240]   winners, which are small.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.480]   No, I'm using leverage and I'm creating these big winners.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:19.320]   But what happened in 2007, 2008 real estate has a much bigger, and this is, by the way,
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:25.600]   not just that one downturn, but when real estate goes bad, real estate flushes so many
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   people. Real estate is just, it has a great toilet flushing system when things go
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.440]   horrible. And it's all because of leverage.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.400]   So real estate is going to be much better than the stock market when things are really
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.440]   great. And it's going to be much, much worse when things go wrong.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.360]   Yeah. The couple of things I'll point out that I think make it a little bit different to
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.040]   take on leverage with your investment portfolio is that when you take out a loan
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.720]   against your portfolio, if your portfolio drops enough, the brokerage firm is going to
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.840]   call back and say, hey, you need to deposit more money.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.600]   And if you own a house and the house value drops, if you don't have money to pay your
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.400]   bills, then you're going to be underwater.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.200]   But the bank isn't going to take back the house if the value drops.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.080]   So one of the biggest reasons that leverage on your investment portfolio is much
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.600]   riskier than leverage on a home is that you're not guaranteed that they won't recall
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.680]   that if the underlying asset drops.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.400]   And then the second big one is that you're not locking in an interest rate.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:29.000]   So you could borrow money from your portfolio at one price and interest rates rise and
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   that rate would go much higher and cost much more than you thought it would.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.360]   I have never had a client back when I was a planner where I recommended it.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:44.720]   And I also never had a client who it didn't make them sleep better at night.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.880]   It always made them sleep worse.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.240]   Yeah. For the two reasons you said, if the stock market goes south tomorrow, I might
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   get called. If you keep those loans small, maybe.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.520]   But yeah, that's one thing that I talked about in another newsletter was look, if you
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.360]   keep the loan small enough, right, if you borrow against your portfolio and you borrow
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.280]   10 percent of it, your portfolio is going to have to go down.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.920]   I'm not going to quote numbers more than half.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.480]   I think the magic number is somewhere around like 30, 30, 40 percent.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.800]   Your portfolio would have to drop by 50 percent.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   So if you borrowed against 10 percent and did something with it, I don't think that
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.920]   you have a lot of risk that you're going to get called.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.200]   I still think there's a lot of interest rate risk.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.800]   Someone told me, what if I what if I borrow against my portfolio at 2 percent and I go
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.520]   put it somewhere where I can earn 5 percent?
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.920]   And I said, look, if it's a short term kind of thing, whether it's an investment or
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   whether it's to renovate your house and you have a plan to pay that back, either with
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.120]   savings or, you know, by withdrawing money, then you're not really subject to the
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.280]   interest rate risk, because if interest rates go up, hopefully you can pay it off.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.520]   And I don't expect interest rates to go up by 5, 10 percent in a matter of months.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.800]   I've always said, look, if it's small enough that you're you're kind of avoiding the
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.840]   margin risk and it's short term or the money you're using it for is something you
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.640]   have access to, it's not as scary, unfortunately, because of those things, because
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.040]   you're not locking in the interest rate, because I just don't think you could take
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.000]   the kind of leverage you can with a home as safely.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.680]   So for me, it's not something that I'm forexing by.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.880]   You know, I'm not taking 80 percent of the value out of my portfolio and trying to
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.680]   bet it somewhere. And the stuff, Chris, that can go wrong has nothing to do with you.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.560]   When we look at the last numbers on inflation and we know what the response is for the
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.040]   Fed rate to come up, which is not a direct link for all other things, but the Fed rate
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.560]   is the prime mover that that begins the cascade of other interest rates going up.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.240]   So whether directly or indirectly.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.960]   So if we're in a rising interest rate environment like now, I think the risk is even
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.480]   higher.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.400]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.640]   And I don't think people that have only been thinking about buying a home and
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:56.400]   realize that interest rates for mortgages in the recent past have been way higher.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.920]   So early 2000s interest rates got as high as seven, eight percent.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.840]   And my parents have talked about interest rates being in the teens.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.800]   Back in the 80s.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:13.240]   Yeah. So I think it's easy to think, gosh, borrowing money is always, you know, one,
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.080]   two, three percent, because that's what it's been the last few years.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.360]   It's very possible if history is any indication that those interest rates to borrow
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.320]   money could go up.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   And that's great if you locked in your mortgage rate for 30 years, but it's not great if
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.760]   you borrowed against your portfolio and your interest rate is, you know, variable with
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.840]   the market. I also like and this is another hack I like based on what you're talking
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.880]   about. I like looking at the next domino, right?
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.880]   And another domino that gets played here, if people are zoning out because this doesn't
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.400]   apply to me, there's a broader thing that we're saying, which is that if you have
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.560]   loans that aren't fixed rate loans and you have the opportunity right now in this
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:57.000]   environment to lock in a fixed rate strategy on your debt, if you've debt, you don't
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.120]   have a fixed rate strategy.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.200]   I would be trying hard to switch to a fixed rate strategy.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.720]   Yeah. Yeah. We refinance.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.160]   And this is a good example of where I guess you could use leverage to invest if you do
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.600]   have a home. If you're refinancing your home and it's appreciated.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.560]   You might have the option to take some money out.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.480]   And so this is an interesting one that I had a fun debate with Andy Radcliffe about, you
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.640]   know, his kind of stance is you probably should never borrow to invest.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.560]   And that was his kind of belief.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.360]   And I said, well, when you buy a new home, it's OK to put 20 percent down.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.040]   He's like, yeah. I was like, but if I own a home and I have 40 percent equity, can I
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.560]   take 20 percent out and invest it?
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.840]   He's like, oh, this is a you caught me in a situation where I would tell you if you
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.560]   were buying a new home, then, yeah, put 20 down and take the extra and invest it.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.240]   But for me, if you have an opportunity to cash out and refinance it, that's an
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.640]   opportunity that I have personally taken.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   I'm not obviously going to recommend anyone do anything, but it's something to
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.600]   consider. And and the hack here and this probably only matters if you live in a high
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.800]   cost of living area.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.720]   But if your mortgage interest deduction is seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars now
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.800]   in the U.S., if you cash out refi and your mortgage ends up being greater and you
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.560]   invest that difference, the interest expense you pay on that additional mortgage is
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.320]   actually deductible as long as it pays off interest expense you've earned, meaning
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.240]   capital gains, dividends, appreciation.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.360]   So that's I'll put a little quick something in the show notes if you want to dig in
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.160]   there. But that's a little too technical for the rest of this talk.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160]   And we've already gone deep enough.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.360]   So I'm going to I'm going to stop here.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.640]   And if you want more from Joe, he has a wonderful podcast that I've had the pleasure
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.000]   of joining a few times and a great book.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.480]   But Joe, where can people find everything you're working on?
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.200]   Yeah, you'll find us at Stacking Benjamins.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.960]   And the book is at Stacking Benjamins dot com slash stacked.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.240]   I'm doing a 42 city tour, Chris, coming to see as many stackers as possible around the
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.240]   country. We're going to try to get as many people like you wherever people live, get as
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.160]   many of the financial community there.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.840]   So hopefully meet some local people that you might have read or heard before in
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.240]   different towns. It's going to be fun for that whole tour.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.280]   And to meet up with us.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.520]   I know in in San Francisco, we're going to be at South Pacific Brewing.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.040]   I used to live one block from their wonderful venue.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.800]   I heard it's a fantastic place.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.960]   I can't wait to go. But anyway, to get all the dates, Stacking Benjamins dot com slash
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.080]   stacked and come and hang out with us and other people.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.040]   We call them stackers, but come other people trying to stack.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.960]   You got stackers. I guess we got hackers, hackers and stackers.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.520]   Let's love it. It's in San Francisco.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.000]   Let's get the hackers and stackers together.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.200]   Sounds great. All right.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.560]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.520]   Thanks a lot, man. That was fun.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.200]   Wow, there was a lot of great stuff in there, and I really hope you enjoyed it.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.280]   Lots of stuff for the show notes.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.240]   And if you haven't already looked up Joe's book, definitely check it out on a separate
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.600]   note. We are a few days away from twenty twenty two.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.040]   So I just want to say thank you for all your listening and support.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.840]   I can't wait for everything that's coming next year.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.680]   Have a wonderful New Year's Eve and I'll see you next week.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.680]   Bye bye.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.740]   you
