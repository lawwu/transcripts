[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Ty writes in to ask, "What does it mean for the Spirit to bear witness with our
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.600]   spirit that we are children of God?"
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.560]   This is enormously important because what I have found over the years is that right
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:32.760]   up there with fear and lust and anger, Christians everywhere at some time, all of us, deal with
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   the problem of assurance, the assurance of salvation.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   Am I really a Christian?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.460]   Every Christian deals with this at some point, and some Christians all the time.
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.160]   And so I really would like to help here if I can.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.360]   So this person is thinking about Romans 8, 14 to 16.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.000]   So let me read the verses because the verses themselves provide the clue to what is being
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.120]   meant here.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.840]   This is verse 14, Romans 8.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.000]   "All who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.560]   So led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.640]   A clue that you're the son of God is that you're being led by the Spirit.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.560]   Verse 15, "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.840]   have received the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.320]   A very intimate, warm, personal, affectionate cry to God as our Father.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.400]   The Spirit is witnessing.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.600]   Verse 16, "The Spirit himself bears witness," is witnessing in that cry, "Abba, Father,"
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.680]   So here's the first thing I would say.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.000]   The witness of the Holy Spirit that you are a child of God is not a word whispered in
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   your ear.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.800]   "You're my child."
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.840]   That's not the way he does it.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.320]   That's external, and the devil could do that to an unbeliever.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.960]   I don't doubt that the devil does whisper that in people's ears, because it says at
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.440]   the end of the day, there are going to be people who think they've called Jesus Lord,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.400]   and they really haven't.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   What it means is two things, and these are in the text.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.360]   It is the work of the Spirit.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   So the witness of the Spirit is the work of the Spirit giving evidences in our lives that
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   we are the sons of God.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   Now get that from verse 14, "All who are led by the Spirit are the sons of God."
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:54.160]   So the work of the Spirit leading us is the Spirit witnessing in our lives that we are
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   God's.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.120]   His work provides evidences, and that's what witnesses do.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.060]   They give evidences of reality.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.520]   So we look for what it means to be led by the Spirit.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:16.400]   And if you go to Galatians 5, being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, living
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.240]   by the Spirit is the same as bearing the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.840]   So we look for love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.880]   In other words, as we look at our lives, are there evidences that the Spirit is producing
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.280]   things that are contrary to a fallen, unbelieving, selfish human nature?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:48.240]   And I want to be real clear here, never does the Bible say that the evidence is perfection.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.760]   It's always a direction of life where we say, "This, this, and this was contrary to my selfish
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.240]   spirit, and God worked that in me.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.680]   I thank you, God, for giving me some measure of evidence that I belong to God."
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   That's number one.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.720]   So verse 14 points to the fact that the witness of the Spirit is His giving evidences in our
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.480]   life that we're His.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   And here's the second one.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:30.220]   It means a heartfelt cry rises up in us to God as our Father and Christ as our Lord.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:39.040]   So verse 15 and 16, "You have received the Spirit of adoption as sons by whom you cry,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.360]   'Abba, Father!'
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   The Spirit Himself bearing witness with your spirit."
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   So when there rises in the believer's heart a humble, authentic, dependent, thankful,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.900]   happy Father, Father, that's the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.700]   Because a person who is without Christ cannot call out to God in a dependent, loving, thankful,
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   humble way.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   They're too selfish.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.180]   They're too self-reliant.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.560]   They don't treat God that way.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.940]   And the reason I said it's also a heart cry to Jesus as Lord is because He says almost
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.780]   the same thing in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.780]   3.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.060]   "Therefore, I want you to understand, no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says,
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.860]   'Jesus is cursed.'
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.420]   And no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit."
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.700]   So if your heart rises up not only to say, "Father, Father, I need you," but also rises
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.820]   up to say, "Jesus, my Master, my Lord, my God, my everything."
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.880]   If your heart rises up to say that, that's the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.380]   That's the evidence of God in your life.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.660]   That's part of His assuring work.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.180]   So here's one last counsel.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:20.980]   The source of assurance, finally, is not found by focusing on our hearts and ourselves.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.140]   It's found by focusing on that Lord and that Father.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:35.260]   Because Jesus said, "When the Spirit of truth comes," this is John 16, 13, and 14, "When
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.460]   the Spirit of truth comes, He will glorify me."
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.460]   Which means, if you want the Holy Spirit to be at work in you, awakening that authentic
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:53.060]   cry to Jesus, "My Lord and to God, my Father," you look to them.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.280]   You look to them, because that's whom the Holy Spirit glorifies.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.820]   If you look within and take your life, I mean your eyes, off of Jesus, what's the Holy Spirit
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   going to glorify?
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.560]   There's nothing for Him to magnify if you're not looking at Jesus and the Father.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:17.740]   So bottom line, the Holy Spirit's witness is, one, His work in us to create evidences
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.900]   that we're His child by producing the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.500]   And number two, it's His awakening in us of a heartfelt cry, "Daddy, Father, I need you.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.140]   And Jesus, you're my Lord, you're my guide, you're my treasure."
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.220]   When our hearts are crying out with authentic dependence like that, and our lives are giving
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:46.500]   some evidence of His presence, then that's the work of the Holy Spirit witnessing.
