[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the portion of scripture
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.560]   we read at the beginning in the book of the prophet Ezekiel and
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.360]   reading now from the second half of the last verse of the first chapter and
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.160]   The first two verses of the second chapter. I begin to read halfway through verse 28 of chapter 1
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.700]   this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.560]   when I saw it I fell upon my face and
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.060]   I heard a voice of one that spake and
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.940]   He said unto me son of men
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.340]   stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee and
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.660]   The spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.540]   That I heard him that
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.820]   spake unto me
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.740]   Now here as I reminded you at the beginning of the reading. We have an account of the call and the commissioning of
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.340]   the prophet
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.620]   Ezekiel
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.940]   It's an amazing description as you must have noticed in the reading this morning and whenever you've read
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.580]   This great chapter for yourselves
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.340]   Now I'm concerned about it in one respect only
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.780]   Not so much in terms of Ezekiel himself and what he was called and commissioned to do important though that is
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.940]   But I am concerned rather
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.900]   with what happened to him and
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.140]   His reaction to it
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:46.020]   In a sense this experience of Ezekiel was unique and yet in another it wasn't it's one of a series of a similar
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.140]   Experiences which one reads of in the scripture Moses you remember had a similar experience
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740]   You'll find it described in Exodus 33
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.140]   Daniel had a similar experience and then the Apostle John
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.940]   Describes how he had a similar experience in the first chapter of the book of Revelation
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.500]   There are individual variations in these experiences and yet what strikes one of course is
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.580]   the
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300]   element, which is common to them all and
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.060]   It is to that particular
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.140]   Element that I'm anxious to call attention
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.020]   this morning
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:37.180]   What I'm interested in therefore in other words and anxious to consider with you is what we may well call the real end of religion
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.660]   The ultimate object of it all
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.340]   We mustn't allow the imagery and the details to mislead us
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.220]   This book of Ezekiel in particular is full of such imagery
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.500]   The truth is presented through him in that particular form, pictures, images
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   But we mustn't lose ourselves in the details, but rather
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.420]   grasp the great central object of
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.820]   All that we are given in such detail in the picture. It is all a great manifestation of God
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.300]   to the Prophet as are the other instances to which I've already
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.020]   referred
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.540]   now
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.900]   the thing therefore that is of interest to us is
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.340]   What God felt
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.580]   was necessary in the case of Ezekiel before he could truly function as his prophet and as his
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.260]   mouthpiece
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.980]   You see he wasn't merely given a message. He was given a message that follows
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.980]   in chapter 2 and right through, but before that happens this other thing had to happen and
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.100]   Nothing is more important than that we should bear the relationship of those two things
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.420]   altogether clearly always in our minds
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.620]   You get these various
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.380]   Visions given to people in the Old Testament you get the so-called theophanies
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.940]   The Lord Jesus Christ appearing in a human form to different people you remember it in the case of Abram
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:22.100]   In the case of Samson's mother and so on now all these have the same grand objective
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.020]   and
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.900]   What's important for us is to concentrate I say on the purpose of these
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.940]   It isn't that we should seek visions. God forbid that we should do that. It isn't that we should
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.680]   Be anxious to see things such as were seen by Ezekiel. That isn't the thing the important thing is
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.420]   That we should realize the essential experience which was thus
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:58.860]   Granted to him now in this particular description of it. We have it all of course in a very intense form
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.740]   The other examples I've quoted likewise put it in a very intense form
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.860]   We must not expect nor anticipate that
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.380]   There are variations in the degree of spiritual experiences, but it isn't the degree that matters
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:23.860]   It isn't the extent that matters. It is the thing itself the quality of the thing itself
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.140]   This is true, of course of every aspect of the Christian life
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:39.060]   But the Bible gives us certain notable and outstanding instances and illustrations
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.700]   In order to direct our attention to the principle itself to the thing itself
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.900]   And it is in that way that we are going to examine this
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.620]   Remarkable experience that was given to the prophet
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:04.320]   Ezekiel. Now, why am I doing this? Well, I'm doing it for this reason. It seems to me that one of the greatest dangers
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.900]   confronting us all
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.780]   is to take for granted the most important and the most vital thing in connection with our Christian faith and
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.980]   To take it for granted to such an extent as sometimes perhaps not even
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.700]   To know it at all
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.700]   Our greatest danger always is to miss the wood because of the trees and
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.380]   We tend to become interested in various details of the Christian life to such an extent
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:41.420]   That the vital thing that makes it Christianity sometimes is entirely forgotten and ignored
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.420]   How easy it is
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.960]   to be living on the outskirts to be dwelling in the vestibules and
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   To miss the glory and the grace and the splendor
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   but after all that is the object and the purpose of
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.060]   Religion of the Christian faith
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.900]   The Apostle Peter reminds us that the Lord Jesus Christ came into this world and died
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.220]   In order to bring us to God
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.020]   And it doesn't matter my friends what we may have
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   Unless we know that we have been brought to God
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.820]   God
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.860]   Ezekiel had a living experience of the living God and
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.260]   That is I say the end of the object
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.540]   The center of the Christian faith the highest beatitude of all I take it is this
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.260]   blessed of the pure in heart
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.660]   For they shall see God
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.100]   Now that's the end. That's the object
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.660]   that is the ultimate and
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.060]   If we fail to keep our eye constantly perpetually upon this
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.100]   All else in the end
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.220]   Will avail us little now there are various forces
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:10.660]   That tend to militate against this as we all must realize in our own personal experiences. There are certain
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.580]   oppositions and enemies outside us
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.300]   They are quite obvious in the modern world, aren't they?
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.700]   That's why we are hearing so much about communism and things like that
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.420]   But you know, my dear friends the real enemies of our souls are not the ones that are outside us
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420]   They're the ones that are inside us
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.100]   It's not difficult to detect these
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.860]   External enemies. They are so obvious
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:42.380]   And a man can be an expert on them and recognize them and resist them and yet still know nothing at all
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.460]   About that which is described here by the prophet Ezekiel
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.420]   You see there is the danger of our being content with a kind of traditionalism
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.380]   The danger of our being content with being religious
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:03.580]   We can be interested in in the church and in church life and in church activities
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:11.780]   And imagine that we are truly Christian, but you know, you can be a very good churchman and still know nothing about God
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.860]   It's an appalling possibility
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.140]   To substitute our own
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:24.940]   Activities, our own busyness, the fact that we were brought up to do these things and have always done them and rather like them and like
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.780]   the people who do such things
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.060]   There's all the difference in the world between meeting together in a building and meeting together with God
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:40.900]   And alas, it's terribly possible to meet together in a building such as this or any similar building
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.060]   and
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.060]   Not to meet with God
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.460]   But my dear friends, what's the value of this?
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.500]   How will that help you when you're on your deathbed? How will that help you at the bar of judgment?
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.780]   That's not the end and object
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:02.340]   these things are incidental, but they're a very real danger and then of course there is the
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.980]   Danger of what we have often described as a kind of believism
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.580]   Which means that people
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.460]   Fall into the delusion of thinking that as long as they repeat the right phrases and shibboleths that they're Christians
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:26.740]   But my whole object this morning is to remind you again that you can say everything that is right and yet know nothing at all
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.260]   About this which happened to Ezekiel
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.420]   He died that he might bring us to God
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.940]   You can be absolutely orthodox in your statements and still be spiritually dead
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:49.540]   There's nothing to prevent a man of intelligence in doing that and many have done it and those who are less intelligent
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.980]   They do it they repeat formally and they think that that makes them Christian, but it doesn't we've got a test
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.220]   Our profession and what we think we are by some deeper and sounder tests
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.100]   well, then I would put next to that a kind of intellectualism I
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.420]   differentiate between these two because
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.380]   Believism is not always intellectual
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.980]   but there are those who go beyond that and are very interested in theology and in doctrine and
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:21.480]   Definitions of faith and they read learnedly and talk learnedly and they're very satisfied and happy with it
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.780]   But again, you can do all that and still know nothing about this experience
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.500]   The highest intellectual knowledge is no substitute for this knowledge of God
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.580]   What a terrible danger it is
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:44.700]   You can be a theologian and dead spiritually at the same time and even an orthodox theologian
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.740]   The Apostle Paul, of course says this also perfectly in 1 Corinthians 13
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:59.540]   You can have all knowledge and all this understanding and so forth, but if you lack this love it profits you nothing
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.380]   Speak with the tongues of men and of angels no good. There's nothing in it
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:10.920]   Well now these are some of the horrible and the terrible dangers that afflict us and that is why it seems to me that from
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.400]   Time to time we should take occasion to examine the very center the whole
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:22.420]   Foundation to discover where we are then you can add the danger of a kind of moralism doing good that passing as Christianity
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.420]   That's very popular at the present time
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.340]   They say it doesn't matter what you believe as long as you do good
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.660]   As long as you show the Spirit of Christ and self-sacrifice and so on that's it. And then especially at the moment this
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.900]   Great concern about social concern. We are told that this has been the great lack in
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:46.920]   Evangelicalism it isn't true in fact to start with but then we are told that this must be the great thing now the social concern
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.940]   Well, you can have a very great social concern, but it's of no value
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.020]   You can give all your goods to feed the poor you can go beyond it and give your body to be burned
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.580]   But if you haven't love this
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:04.580]   Love of God in your heart and love to God. It's of no value. It's useless
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:11.780]   Well here then are some of the things which we seek and so easily absorb us and we can go on year by year
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:18.900]   God knows a man can stand in a pulpit and preach and still his own soul may be ignorant of these things
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.460]   We all must needs examine ourselves. We are victims of habits and customs
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:32.700]   Traditions practices and on and on we go the wheel turns year after year, but I ask in the name of God
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.580]   What's it leading to? Where's it bringing us?
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.860]   Are we nearer to God than we were this time last year?
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.980]   Do we know him better than we did ten years ago?
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.220]   That's the question. It's the only question that really matters
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:57.900]   Well, very well, the whole emphasis here is upon what I would call the experimental or if you prefer it the experiential
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.780]   Or indeed, I venture to use the term the mystical element
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:09.860]   in the Christian faith and in the life and the condition of the soul
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:18.260]   Now I argue that this is the great thing taught everywhere in the Bible in the Old Testament and in the new
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   You go through your Old Testament
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.620]   pick out your great heroes of the faith and
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:30.220]   Invariably you will find that their chiefest characteristic was this they were men that knew God
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:36.900]   Abram was a friend of God Enoch walked with God
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.980]   Isaiah
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.940]   Had that knowledge of God so at this man
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.340]   So they all had and it's exactly the same in the New Testament
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.780]   The essential experience is exactly the same in the Old Testament and in the new
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:01.100]   There is perhaps a greater clarity. It's more specific in the new because the Lord had come and had done his work
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.580]   It's the shadow in the old the substance in the new but it's the same thing
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:10.020]   As I say the intensity varies, but the essential experience is always one
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.060]   And it is to this that I'm calling attention. I
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.260]   Need scarcely say I'm sure that I'm not here to say that nothing matters, but experience. I
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.620]   Spent most of my time in refuting it
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.500]   But what I am here to say is this
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.060]   That the element of experience is absolutely
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:38.380]   Essential the tragedy is that we always will put these things up as opposites. We react so violently
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.980]   Some people say that nothing matters, but experience they're not interested in definitions
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.820]   But as long as you felt something I've had a great change in your life. That's all right
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.620]   Well, of course that is all wrong according to the scriptures
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:57.860]   But then it's tragic to go and react against that and say oh nothing matters, but intellectual apprehension and formulation
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.260]   That's equally wrong. That's essential
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.940]   But if it isn't accompanied by experience as I've been indicating
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:13.500]   There is no value in it whatsoever. The glory of the biblical position is that it always has the two running parallel
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.820]   And therefore as we come to analyze this experience
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.280]   We shall see that the two elements always go together
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:28.260]   the false experience will never stand up to the tests that emerge here and
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:36.100]   So there is no need of our being afraid of cultivating a false experience. My proposition therefore is this
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:44.140]   That the ultimate end and object of the Christian faith is to bring us into a living experience of God
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.940]   Now what are the characteristics of this experience
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.460]   Well, they're here laid open before us. I
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.940]   Simply want to hold them before you briefly this morning
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:03.100]   Examine yourself in the light of them go on doing so. What is the first thing?
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:10.540]   What is the first essential in other words before any man has a right to call himself a Christian? I
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:16.460]   Wouldn't hesitate to answer that it's this it is a sense of God
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:22.700]   An awareness of God
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:30.220]   This I say is the whole object of salvation
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.180]   Man was made in the image of God in correspondence with God and was in communion with God
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.500]   Sin was that which cut off the communion and caused the separation
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:48.220]   So that men became a stranger from God and no longer enjoyed fellowship with God. What's the object of salvation?
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.660]   well to restore them
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:58.460]   To reconcile men unto God and that I say means something in the realm of experience
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:05.580]   So that it restores to men this living sense of God this
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.820]   Awareness of God, that's what happened to Ezekiel
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.500]   Here I say it's in a very intense form
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.100]   He saw these appearances
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:21.380]   These beasts the wheels and these extraordinary colors. That's all right
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:27.200]   It's given us in a pictorial form in order that it may direct our attention to it. These things are not essentials
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.620]   But the thing itself of course is the thing that matters. Of course, the imagery is human
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:41.620]   Because there is a sense in which such an experience cannot be described it baffles description and yet it is well
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.620]   It is always known
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:51.260]   Any man who's ever had a sense of God and an awareness of God he knows it and he'll never forget it
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.580]   He knows exactly what it means. I
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.140]   Would borrow once more a phrase from Wordsworth
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:04.580]   He didn't mean what I'm talking about, but I think his phrase is helpful if I use it, but as an illustration
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.020]   He says for I have felt a presence
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:15.060]   That disturbs me with the joy of elevated thought
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:21.940]   And that I say is the central thing in this Christian life of ours
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.540]   The presence
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   The sense of God
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.500]   What what are its features? What are its characteristics?
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.100]   Well here it is. Isn't it the glory of God?
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.420]   This is a great account of a
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.520]   manifestation of the glory of God
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:52.060]   You notice the terms he uses this he says was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.500]   No man can see God and live
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.620]   Ezekiel didn't see God. He couldn't have stood the test of the sight more than anybody else, but what he was given was an
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:09.500]   Appearance of the likeness of the glory. He didn't see the glory itself. That's in effort
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:18.260]   But there is a likeness of the glory and he was given to see an appearance of that likeness
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:24.100]   You see how distant it is and you see how the Old Testament and the New go together
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:30.940]   We see as in a glass dark place as the great apostle I see as in a riddle in an enigma
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.660]   That's all because we can't stand anymore while we're in this life and in this world
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:44.620]   He only saw the appearance of the likeness, but oh what an appearance it was and it was I say of the glory of God
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.620]   That
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.940]   Is I suppose the most essential attribute of God
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.020]   His glory
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.140]   His glory fills the heavens
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.420]   the brightness
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:09.540]   You see we have imagery here trying to express it of fire and of lightning. Oh, but it's all utterly inadequate
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.540]   Beloved people have we any sense of the glory of God?
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.980]   Do you ever think about this?
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.180]   Do you ever meditate upon it? Do you ever pause in the presence?
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:32.260]   Have you ever felt however dimly and vaguely something of the sense of the glory of the everlasting God?
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.660]   That's what was given to his ego as it was given to all the others
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.140]   The Apostle Paul says you see this is what makes good Christians Christians
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.860]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.500]   That's shined in our hearts. What for?
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.100]   to give the light of the knowledge of
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.820]   the glory of God
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   In the face of Jesus Christ
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.500]   That's it. We have this treasure in earthen vessels. I know but that's what we've got. That's what we've had
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.060]   That's what makes us Christians as Paul the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:15.540]   You see we're not just looking negatively at these things
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:20.220]   Why no communism's anti-god, but you I can be an anti-communist
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.660]   But still the question is do I know anything of the light of the knowledge of the glory of God?
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.380]   It's so easy to be negative, but this
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.820]   This is positive. This is vital. This is living
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.860]   The glory and the greatness and the majesty of God
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.860]   The government is in his hands upon his shoulders
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.780]   You read here about this
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.660]   fire and
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:52.260]   I saw the color of amber as the appearance of fire roundabout within it from the appearance of his lines even upward and from the
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:58.180]   Appearance of his lines even downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness roundabout
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.540]   What does this indicate? Well, not only government but
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.100]   justice and judgment
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.740]   The
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.620]   Everlasting God in all his glory and majesty and might and dominion. He's a righteous God
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.260]   He's a just God. He's a holy God. He's the judge of all the earth
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.980]   Ezekiel
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   Knew that he was in the presence of this God
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.740]   And that is Christianity that's what it means
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.460]   But thank God he saw the colors also of the rainbow and this always means mercy
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:43.180]   Lest he be crushed utterly there was this manifestation of mercy. Let me try and sum it all up for you
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.180]   The first point I'm making is this
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.740]   That I would say that the first and the chief is characteristic of the Christian the test
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.980]   I mean which I apply to him when he's told me all that he believes and brings out so glibly all the phrases
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   I say my friend
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.300]   Are you God fearing?
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:07.700]   Do you know anything about reverence and godly fear
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.140]   Have you an awareness of God
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.320]   Do you know anything about the glory of the Almighty God?
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:24.500]   That's it. There's the first thing but let me go on the second thing is of course the sense of God this great God
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.940]   Dealing personally with us
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   I
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.860]   Was Ezekiel you see God suddenly
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.500]   Began to speak when now it came to pass in the 30th year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.260]   Oh, there's no trouble about remembering the details
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:49.060]   When any man has a living experience of God, he never forgets it. He can tell you exactly when it happened
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:54.380]   The fourth month in the fifth day as I was among the captives by the river of Kibar
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.740]   But the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.860]   God began to deal with him personally and this is again one of the essential
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.540]   features of a truly Christian position
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:13.140]   You know, a man can't be a Christian. It's impossible without having a sense that God has interfered in his life
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:24.540]   You see you'll get that even at the beginning in your conviction, don't you and at that stage you may very well resent the interference
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.500]   You may say I want to live my own life. I want to go my own way
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:33.100]   Why should God interfere with me? Why should he come but you see he does he puts his hand upon you
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.060]   He calls you and you are disturbed
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.700]   You're conscious that God is dealing with you and with you personally and he's speaking to you
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:46.260]   You're being addressed by God and you know that you are he's come into your life. He's doing things to you
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.300]   What we know about the hand of God upon us
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:01.200]   To the extent that God has taken hold on us and has done something to us that the living God whom
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:09.700]   we'd always spoken about perhaps but who had been some vague abstraction to us our philosophic X some absolute away in the heavens that this
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.060]   God in a living personal manner has been dealing with us individually and personally
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.180]   It's so easy to talk about Christianity
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:28.660]   It's so easy to talk about Christendom to be excited about Western civilization and the great philosophical position
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:35.940]   But my dear friend if all that hasn't become personal and you are aware that you are face to face with this living God
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.940]   I say it's not Christianity
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:45.380]   It's the whole object of Christianity to reconcile us to God and to bring us into this relationship and here is this man
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:52.820]   There's one thing he was more certain of than anything else was that at this point this living God began to deal with him personally
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:58.420]   He was called to his office we are called by God unto salvation
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:06.740]   But let us go on with our examination each one of these things of course could be easily expended
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:13.060]   I'm merely giving you some headings whereby we may test ourselves the inevitable effect of this always
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.340]   Is the third thing which is humbling?
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.380]   And when I saw it I fell upon my face
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:26.220]   And I heard a voice of one that speak I
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.060]   Fell upon my face
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:42.420]   People sometimes like to talk about the lost chord of Christianity or of evangelicalism
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.620]   The missing aspect of our faith
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:51.260]   If I were to be asked my opinion on that question this would be my answer
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.580]   The sense of humbling the falling upon our faces
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:04.260]   The tragedy today is is it not that we are all so healthy we are all so glib
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.820]   We are all so assured we are all so busy
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.060]   I'm not advocating clearly a dull solemnity
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.180]   Or some kind of artificial
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:25.500]   Humility of the Uriah heap type no no that's not what I'm talking about the thing that I'm discussing with you
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.460]   It doesn't need any
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:34.020]   Demonstration it needs no argument my dear friend any man who has some glimpse of the glory of God being evitable
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.660]   Is humble I?
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.540]   fell upon my face
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.460]   Why well an utter sense of unworthiness?
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:48.420]   You can't behold purity without feeling unclean
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.380]   You can't look at light without
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.020]   Being aware of the darkness
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:02.300]   You can't look at greatness and majesty and might without feeling yourself shrinking to nothing
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.700]   Your smallness your weakness
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   You are nothing
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:18.180]   There is no more characteristic mark of the true Christian than just this very thing
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:25.340]   Humbleness the sense of being humbled now. I don't even mean humility at this point
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:32.740]   I mean something more important than humility humility is the outcome of this which I'm trying to describe as humblest humbleness
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.060]   being humbled humbling
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.220]   What it means is this you see
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:45.180]   That a man has some conception not only of his utter sinfulness
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.620]   But of his utter insignificance
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.460]   His utter smallness
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:59.540]   Now this is very difficult in this age in which you and I live you see man is bursting of his achievements man has never been
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:06.940]   So self-confident man and the most difficult thing in the world is for a man to feel that he is nothing and nobody
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.460]   And knows nothing and is weak and is ugly and vile and foul
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.780]   And there's only one thing that will ever make a man feel that and that is the sight
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.340]   of God a
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.860]   glimpse of God
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.620]   Don't materialize this over much don't be over
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.740]   Anxious I say about the imagery again. You may see nothing you may have no vision
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.380]   but if you have this sense of God if you have an awareness of his glory and his
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.540]   ineffability and his majesty and his righteousness and his holiness
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:48.740]   Oh, you'll just feel that you want to run away. You'll say with Isaiah. Woe is me. I'm a man of unclean lips
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.380]   I'm undone
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.340]   John felt the same all these men have felt the same
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:01.340]   The greatest saints the world has ever known have always been the men who've had the greatest sense of their own
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:09.180]   Unworthiness their own sinfulness their own utter weakness and inability and nothingness my friends. Do we know anything about this?
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.180]   Have you ever felt utterly hopeless about yourself?
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.020]   lost forlorn
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.940]   Ugly foul have you ever known what it is to cry out in some shape or form Oh
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.760]   Wretched men that I am who shall deliver me
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.680]   That's the invariable and the inevitable consequence of this experience
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.000]   this awareness
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.160]   this sense of
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.560]   the presence of God and
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:46.600]   Then the last thing which I would emphasize is this these are just principles by which we test ourselves
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:56.060]   The next thing is and it follows of course with this curious inevitability is the sense that we have received everything from God
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:03.040]   He said unto me son of men stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee and
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   He couldn't of course he was utterly weak. He'd fallen upon his face to the ground
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:14.200]   He couldn't lift himself who could stand in the presence of such a being the thing is impossible, but the command comes
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.560]   Stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   But this is what happened and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.960]   That I heard him that spake unto me
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.160]   Oh here's a test of our Christianity
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   of our whole Christian position
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.640]   The Christian is a man who is conscious of having received everything from God
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.120]   Stand upon thy feet. I can't stand upon my feet the spirit comes with the word and puts me on my feet
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   I am what I am
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.680]   by the grace of God I
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.560]   Am not what I am because I have certain abilities because I've had certain training
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.720]   Because I have certain faculties and propensities not at all
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:11.360]   What have ye says the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians what hast thou that thou didst not receive
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:18.480]   There were people bursting about their knowledge and understanding in Corinth and what they were doing. Wait a moment says Paul
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.160]   What hast thou that thou did not receive I?
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.120]   Am what I am
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:32.360]   By the grace of God, I would still be that militant persecuting Pharisee that blaspheming ignorant fool
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:38.800]   Were it not that he took hold on me and made me anew and set me upon my feet
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   We
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.800]   Are his workmanship
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:51.120]   And take it from me my friend that if you think you've made yourself a Christian you're not a Christian at all
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.400]   There's nothing more obvious about the Christian than the fact that he realizes
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.560]   That it is entirely due to the action of God his workmanship
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.440]   Created a new in Christ Jesus if any man be in Christ. He's a new creation
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.480]   I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.200]   And the life I now live in the flesh
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.280]   What's it mean? It means this the Christian is a man who is aware of the fact that he's received new life
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   He was lying on the floor in his helplessness in his weakness in his shame in his sinfulness and in his vileness
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.200]   And a word came to him that set him upon his feet. What is it?
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   Oh, it's the gift of life. It's a regeneration. He's aware that there is a new principle in it. He can't help this
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.680]   He doesn't understand it fully
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.560]   But he knows that it came and it came with the word the spirit upon the word
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.120]   Entered into him made him a new set him on his feet gave him life power
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.600]   Understanding ability and vigor he's ready to be God's servant
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.880]   Do you know that the life of God is in your soul?
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.720]   Have you known this infusion?
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:23.320]   This transfusion if you like of life and power and ability coming to you
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.200]   Do we know what it is to be amazed at ourselves?
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.320]   That we are able to stand in the presence of God
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:38.080]   Oh, you remember again how the Apostle Paul puts it being therefore justified by faith
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.600]   We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.200]   And he says we rejoice in this
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.520]   grace
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.520]   wherein we stand
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.040]   It's a tremendous thing this that a feeble sinful man
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   Can stand in the presence of God? It's God alone who can enable him to do it
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.520]   But he does enable him to do it and he does it by giving him life and power and vigor and strength
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.800]   What's a Christian?
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.920]   Well, a Christian is a man who knows that the God who made everything out of nothing at the beginning
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.840]   Has taken a hold of him and having smashed him. He has made him a new
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:25.560]   Fashioned him after the image of his only son has set him upon his feet can address him and he can listen
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:31.080]   That's my last point. The Christian is a man who is here listening to God. He set me upon my feet
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.600]   That I heard him that spake unto me. He's a man who was mastered by God controlled by God
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.920]   led by God directed by God and
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.880]   Who realizes that he can only live by every word that proceedeth
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.320]   out of the mouth of the Lord
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.240]   Well, there it is my friends
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:00.360]   That's why the Son of God came into this world
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   That's why he died upon the cross
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   To bring us to that not merely to save us from hell not merely that our sins should be forgiven
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.640]   God was in Christ
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.680]   Reconciling the world unto himself
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.640]   This is life eternal
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.600]   That they might know thee
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:32.160]   The only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.720]   Do we know God?
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:42.280]   Have we been in the presence of God and felt it
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.640]   To know and to feel that he was there
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:52.520]   Something of the glory and the greatness and the majesty
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:58.120]   Yes, and the mercy and the power and the coming of life the renewal
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.880]   the newness
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   What value is there in anything
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.920]   If we haven't got that
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.000]   That is the end the ultimate object
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.600]   Of all our faith and every Christian activity
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.000]   This is the center everything else comes out from this but without this
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.800]   All else can be a tinkling symbol refuse useless worthless
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.200]   To know God
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:43.120]   Have you any hunger and thirst after this God does your heart cry out after him the living God?
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.880]   Do you know him
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.000]   Let us ever keep this in the center
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.800]   Whatever we may do
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:59.160]   Let us ever realize that this is the fount the source the origin the beginning the end
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.320]   Blessed are the pure in heart
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.120]   For they
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.720]   Shall see God not the appearance of the likeness then but more
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.760]   They shall see God
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.760]   The
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:24.840]   Closing hymn is hymn number
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   260 260

[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.480]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.600]   260
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.800]   Come dearest Lord descend and dwell
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.920]   By faith and love in every breast
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.560]   Then shall we know and taste and feel
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.600]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   The joys that cannot be expressed
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   Come fill your hearts with good faith
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   In the name of this wonderful day

[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   And to present us faultless
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   Before the presence of his glory
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   With exceeding joy
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   To the only wise God our Saviour
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   Be glory and majesty, dominion and power
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.600]   Both now and ever
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   And the love of God
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   And the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit

[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   Short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.600]   And until we shall be safely in glory
