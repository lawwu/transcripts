[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   A major resignation now.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.040]   An editor at the New York Times.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360]   Showing up for work as a centrist that an American newspaper should not require bravery.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.800]   She's saying no one should be allowed to criticize me.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.640]   They thought them very wise.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.960]   Anyone that departs from woke orthodoxy gets a lot more heat.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.840]   A new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.560]   If you don't have the right views, everything is caveated, edited,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200]   tripled, quadrupled the amount of crimes.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.880]   Should it take courage to say that those who praise the pristine subways of Russia
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.840]   are not journalists, but propagandists?
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.480]   Should it take courage to just say in public, "I disagree"?
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.560]   Join me in welcoming Barry Weiss to the stage.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.720]   Welcome. Hi, Barry.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.240]   Barry, thanks for being here.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.160]   Thanks for the cool weather.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.040]   Really appreciate it.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.840]   Yes, Barry made headlines.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520]   I'm going to give you a little introduction.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.200]   Even though most everyone here knows who you are.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.160]   But you made headlines in 2020 when you left the New York Times,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   criticizing its stance on free speech and diversity of thought.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760]   And since then, you've launched the Free Press.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   Congrats.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.640]   I know a lot of folks here are subscribers.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.520]   And the Free Press declares itself a free press for free people,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.360]   honest, independent, and fearless.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   I think we all respect and admire you for your fiercely independent thinking
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.200]   and direct and honest takes on current events and social issues.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   We feel like you're a kindred spirit.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.560]   Yes, a bestie.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.060]   I wish.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.040]   This may be an audition.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.540]   Let's see.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.560]   I don't know if you guys can handle having a woman in a bestie.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.240]   No, no, we can.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.960]   Just not sex.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.200]   So look, I want to start with a very broad, general question
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   that you can take in any direction you want.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.720]   What's going on in America?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   What are the two sides?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.920]   Because it seems like a lot of what has, as we've been hearing a lot about,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   and I think we're going to hear more about throughout this conference,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.160]   there are polarizing forces at play.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   And the polls kind of get defined differently.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   But is there a unifying thesis here?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.720]   There's the notion of populists and elitists.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   Are there elitists that say I'm an elitist?
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.920]   There's corporate and government folks.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.840]   The pocket square says you're an elitist.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080]   Yes, like pockets where it keeps slipping.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   There's the conservatives versus the liberals.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.400]   I mean, what is the divide in the United States?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.320]   And what is causing the polarity?
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.400]   How would you think about the polarity that's emerged?
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   I think there's two ways, broadly, that I would answer that.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   And obviously, besties push back on me, as I know David Sachs surely will.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.760]   One way to think about it, and I think Martin Goury has written about this
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.960]   absolutely brilliantly in his book, "The Revolt of the Public,"
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.440]   probably the most important book written in the last 25 years.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.400]   Read it.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160]   If you haven't, "Stripe Press," publish it.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.960]   Say it again.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   Martin Goury's book, it's called "The Revolt of the Public."
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.480]   And broadly, what he prophesied, without using the words Donald Trump
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.960]   or BLM or any of the phenomenon that have reshaped American political life
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.000]   over the past several decades, is the sort of--
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.680]   call it the renegades versus the establishment
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.480]   or the outsiders versus the insiders.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.880]   If you want to understand how it can be
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.280]   that Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris are on one side
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.960]   and Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.360]   whatever you think of any of those people are on the other,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.520]   that's how you have to understand that, I think.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.880]   Another way that I've been thinking about a lot, though,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.000]   is sort of like there are three sides that I see that are emerging.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.800]   And I think the free press is trying to position itself
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.160]   in what I believe is the broad, self-silencing majority piece of the pie,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.560]   which is to say there's a woke left.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.480]   There's increasingly a woke right.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   And then there's the normal people.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   And the normal--
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.440]   I mean, this is what people come up--
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.640]   I went to a thing for my daughter's new preschool yesterday,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.080]   and there were some free press readers.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.960]   And they didn't come up to me to talk about any particular piece.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.360]   They just said, "Thank you for being normal."
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.240]   And normal was the adjective that almost all of them used.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.920]   And so I think that that's also something that's happening where,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.240]   you know, I'm sure as has already been discussed at this conference,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.120]   we have this horseshoe in which the left,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.640]   the identitarian sort of anti-liberal left, illiberal left,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.520]   sounds eerily similar at times to the illiberalism of the right.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.840]   And they sort of are in this dance with each other.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.440]   And the rest of us are feeling like,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.560]   "When did everything get so crazy?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.720]   And is there a return to normalcy?"
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   And I'm not saying a return to normalcy
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.800]   in the sense of like returning to some kind of neoliberal consensus.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.000]   I just mean a return to the things that I think many of us still believe
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.600]   are just basic commonsensical American values
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.200]   that right now feel under siege.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.680]   - Let's talk about the media's role in this.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.800]   You and I have been career journalists, editors.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.920]   And so when we were coming up,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.320]   they would take your piece, whatever you wrote,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840]   and they'd just say, "Well, this is an opinion."
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.160]   They'd strike it out and say, "Who are you attributing this to?"
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.320]   There was a very thoughtful process.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   And then something happened economically with link baiting
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.640]   and maybe trying to get more clicks.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.040]   And then this very strange thing happened when Donald Trump got elected
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.800]   that I think you and I both witnessed,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.720]   which was journalists who were, you know,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800]   thought of themselves as independent.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   And storytellers who would just present the facts to an audience
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.840]   then saw themselves as part of the resistance
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.920]   and that they had to stop this individual
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.240]   because they believed he was Hitler.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.880]   And the marketing when you went to the Guardian
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   or the Washington Post or the New York Times,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.240]   at the bottom of a Trump story would say,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.880]   "If you want us to hold truth to power and stop Trump,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.720]   give us your credit card."
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.440]   - Yeah.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.320]   - And this seemed like this bizarre moment.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.920]   Maybe you could just talk about that paradigm shifting
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.680]   because it happened during the economic turmoil as well
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.200]   when journalism got gutted.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.720]   - I think it's deeper than...
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.680]   The roots of this are deeper than Trump.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.400]   We actually have a piece we're running tomorrow afternoon
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   called "When We Started Lying."
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.160]   That's sort of a view from someone
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.560]   that was in the Middle East Bureau of the AP
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.080]   and seeing the roots of this back in 2005, 2006.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.600]   And what that piece argues,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.840]   and I think it's exactly put,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.440]   is people don't really understand
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.400]   that the fundamental job description
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   of mainstream journalism has changed.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.920]   It used to be that the job of journalism,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.000]   and I still believe that this is the job,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.120]   is to hold up a mirror to the world as it actually is
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.800]   so people can make sensible, rational decisions
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   about where to send their kids to school,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.400]   about where to live, about who to vote for,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   about all of the things that are important in this life.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   Tell the story about reality as plainly
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.920]   and as truthfully as you can.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.600]   That is plainly no longer the goal,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.760]   I think, of many "mainstream,"
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.480]   I should put in quotes, American journalists.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.720]   The job description as they see it
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.760]   is to usher you toward the correct political position.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   That's it.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.440]   And once you begin to understand that,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.880]   things that seem crazy, like,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.280]   "Wait, how did they not tell me
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   "about the Hunter Biden laptop story?"
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.800]   Or, "Why did they tell me
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.200]   "that the thing that I saw with my own eyes,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.880]   "which is the obvious mental decline
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.960]   "of the President of the United States,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.280]   "which is relevant to every single person
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   "in this country and in the world, was a lie?"
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.360]   And once you start to understand that,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.960]   you understand the misconstrual of certain stories,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.800]   you understand the absolute silence around others,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.520]   and frankly, that's why we're all here.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.000]   Like, it's given this tremendous opportunity
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.080]   for people who crave that thing
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.360]   that journalism used to do.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.000]   - The truth?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.400]   - Can you...
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.560]   - Yeah, the truth, yeah.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.000]   - Can you just double- - Yeah, the truth.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.440]   - Just double-click into that.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.120]   Like, it's not like there's some grand cabal of people
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.920]   that decide, "Let's obfuscate Biden's decline.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.440]   "Let's elevate this."
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.160]   So what does it actually mean day-to-day?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.920]   Like, how is it actually happening?
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.320]   - Okay.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.360]   - Is it the money?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.240]   Is it the incentives?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.880]   What is happening?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.320]   - There's a few things that happened.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.240]   The first, as Jason was alluding to,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.320]   is that the economic model changed.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.160]   It used to be that if you ran a piece in "The New York Times,"
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.880]   your fear was you were gonna piss off the advertiser
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.480]   that was running next to the story.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.120]   Once the business model shifted,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.440]   you no longer were as concerned about,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.280]   although you still are to some extent,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.160]   about enraging, you know, Procter & Gamble.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.120]   You're worried about enraging the reader, right?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.640]   This is the phenomenon that so many people
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.720]   have talked about, which is audience capture,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.600]   which is as, you know, the individual sub-stacker
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.520]   is as susceptible to this as "The New York Times."
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   None of us are free from that phenomenon either.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.440]   - People respond to your article and say,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   "That was stupid," or "That pissed me off,"
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.520]   and then you feel pressure to change.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.360]   - Unsubscribe or unsubscribe.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.640]   - No, so think about this.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.320]   The court, and I think that these are public figures,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.480]   but something like 95 to 98% of readers
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.160]   at "The New York Times," and I'm choosing that only
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.400]   'cause it's the experience I know most intimately,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.800]   regard themselves as liberals or progressives.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.080]   So if you write, and I'm thinking about my wife,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   who writes about in her book how she,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.360]   after the violent rioting that happened
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.080]   in places like Kenosha, she was a business reporter,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.680]   went and reported on those stories
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.560]   and found that the story was unbelievably complicated,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.440]   that many of these business owners were minority,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.760]   small business owners, they did not have insurance,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.400]   they were absolutely devastated by what happened,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.600]   and you know what happened?
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.280]   She brought, it was an excellent story,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.880]   back to her editors, and they said,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.120]   "Let's wait until after the election to run this."
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.040]   So that's the kind of thing that would happen a lot,
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.240]   and no, there's not like some secret cabal meeting
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.720]   that happens where it says, "Let's make sure
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.800]   "that we lie to our readers about Joe Biden's mental state."
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's the exact same phenomenon that everyone here feels
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   in any social scene or company or institution
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.080]   that they're a part of, which is that human beings
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.320]   are social animals, and if you look
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   at the kinds of people that work at the New York Times,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.880]   they went to the same 10 boarding schools
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.600]   or fancy schools and the same 10 colleges,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.440]   and they marinated in the same set of ideas,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.680]   and they want their kids to go to the same schools
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.440]   in Brooklyn Heights or the Upper West Side,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.160]   and that creates this very particular
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.120]   group thinking phenomenon.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   Let me add one thing, which is that was always there.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   The thing that I think has changed a lot in the past,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.840]   let's call it 20 years, is that the very places
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.160]   that used to be feeders to the New York Times
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   were no longer feeding in sort of
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.040]   your standard center-left liberal Democrat.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.840]   They were feeding in a kind of person
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.280]   who believed in something like revolution
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.480]   and believed that their job was to foment that
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.600]   inside the New York Times.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.880]   - No, but how does that, say more about what does that,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.280]   what do you mean?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.160]   - Well, what I mean by that is that they did not,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.200]   you could look at the values of the New York Times and--
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.480]   - Sorry, okay, wait, just go back a step.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.800]   So the people in the New York Times are fancy,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.760]   basically is what you're saying.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.400]   - I'm not saying, their fanciness is sort of beside the point.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.320]   - Yeah, but I'm saying there was an archetype.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.120]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.400]   - And then that archetype shifted.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:36.880]   - Right.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.120]   - And is that because the feeder schools changed
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.320]   or is that because what they were taught
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.280]   at those schools changed?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.240]   - It's because wokeness happened to American liberalism
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.000]   and the people that were speaking the language
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.720]   of progressivism all of a sudden transformed the notion
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   of what let's say social justice was, right?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.800]   All of a sudden social justice wasn't about doing
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.480]   good by the poor.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.920]   It was actually about a kind of neo-racism
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   and a resegregation.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.480]   All of a sudden, progressivism wasn't actually
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   about human flourishing and progress.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   It was about ensuring equality of outcome
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.840]   rather than equality of opportunity.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.400]   And I don't think that the sort of that transformation,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.200]   which some people have said,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.720]   "Oh, wokeness has peaked, it's over."
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.400]   It cannot be overstated.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.600]   The thing that began at the margins and at the fringe
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.640]   has moved into the center of American institutional life.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.040]   And that is the story of the transformation
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.760]   of the New York Times.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.240]   And it's the story of the transformation of Harvard
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.040]   and so many other places where people all of a sudden
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.000]   turned around and thought,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.480]   "When did everything get so insane?"
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.640]   - Is it a story that ends in socialism
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.320]   as it has in past lives?
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.920]   - I think that, you know, I'm an optimist.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.880]   This is America.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.840]   And I think that there's an unbelievable pushback
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.120]   to this phenomenon.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.920]   But the pushback, I believe...
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.440]   - We have Elon here this afternoon.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:07.940]   - Right.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.040]   The pushback, and this is where I guess
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.640]   I'm more of a radical than a reformer.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.880]   I think I began at the New York Times as a reformer
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.960]   believing that I could make a difference.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.520]   And God bless the people who are still trying to do that.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.200]   I think there's a role for both.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.360]   I think what has made me more of a radical,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.000]   not politically, but just in terms of my posture,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   has been that I've become someone who believes
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   that the way to change those institutions
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.480]   is not to give money to those places
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680]   or join the board of them
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.200]   or delude yourself with the idea
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   that you can transform them from within.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.400]   It's to build new things.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.200]   And in building new things and creating competition,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.760]   it forces the other people to change.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.520]   - Sheri, give a voice to the people.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   If you wouldn't mind, give a voice to the people
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.800]   that want to buck the trend,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.000]   that want to be able to respond to the statement
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.840]   that they are morally bankrupt
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.320]   if they identify that this is not the right path.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.400]   What's the conversation that,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.840]   and this is happening with everyone I know
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.520]   in schools, in workplaces.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.440]   It's not just the institution of the New York Times.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.400]   It's all institutions.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.320]   - Okay, it starts with something very simple.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.680]   Give up the heroin needle of prestige.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.640]   Rip it out of your arm immediately.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.400]   Stop poisoning yourself, your families,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.320]   and your children with the bankrupt notion
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.720]   that them getting into Harvard or Yale
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.520]   is more important than inculcating in them
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.640]   a sense of love, of family, of country,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   and of all of the things we used to think were normal.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.120]   - That, to-- - That could've been clapping
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.400]   'cause he went to Stanford, but no.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.840]   - To me, to me, that, it begins with that
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.960]   because I find myself in these baffling conversations
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.840]   with people where they say, "Thank you for what you do.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.280]   "I'm so grateful for the free press.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.080]   "I'm so grateful."
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.760]   I'm like, "Yeah, and we're talking, it's great."
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.600]   And I'm like, "Where do your kids go to school?"
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.400]   And then they name a place that's like
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.880]   the center of the mind virus.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.520]   And I'm like-- (audience laughing)
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.280]   - Why would you do that?
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.840]   - Well, Al-Qaeda was all filled up.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   They reached their capacities.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   - Right, so to me, it's sort of,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.720]   the beginning of wisdom begins with that
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.360]   and with the confidence that prestige and honor
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.080]   is not something that is granted to you
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.320]   by institutions that have allowed themselves
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.880]   to be corrupted by morally bankrupt people.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.280]   You and your values, they're lucky to have you, right?
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   That's what I think the fundamental posture needs to change.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.640]   - Let's talk about the new stuff we're all building,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.880]   the Go Direct movement, all these new brands.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.800]   You're one of them, we're one of them, I suppose.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.240]   - Are we gonna talk about Founder Mode?
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.680]   I know you guys can explain to me what that is.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.800]   - Well, I mean-- - It's cocaine.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.560]   - No, you're right. - Oh, Barry, it's cocaine.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   - Really? - Yeah, Founder Mode's cocaine.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.560]   - Yeah, it's good.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.200]   We have actually a good-- - I've never done Founder Mode.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.080]   - I can only guess, but--
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.680]   - No, my guys got the best Founder Modes.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   I put some in your green room.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.560]   - Thank you so much.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.400]   If you need more, let me know.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.480]   - I think I've been doing Founder Mode.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.600]   If Founder Mode means working till you collapse every night
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.880]   for three years-- - No, no, that just means
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.240]   being committed and trying to build a business.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.440]   - Yeah, we're talking about cocaine.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.800]   - Founder Mode's being a dealership.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.200]   - It's back.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.320]   But let's seriously talk about--
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.920]   (Barry laughing)
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.440]   It's so funny. - These are back, baby.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.960]   - It's back, woo!
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.840]   It's gonna be a great show.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.920]   So I wanna talk to you about the new stuff
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.640]   that's being built.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.920]   Obviously, you have your subscription-based business
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.960]   doing wonderfully.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.320]   We've got the information.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.160]   We've got all in.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.720]   And then you have everybody who got kicked off
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.760]   of broadcast television
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.000]   or for whatever reasons they left,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.880]   Don Lemon, Megyn Kelly, Tucker--
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.520]   - Katherine Harridge.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.720]   - What's that? - Katherine Harridge.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.000]   - Yeah. - It's fantastic.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.480]   - Yeah, so tons of long tail there.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.840]   But this group is also susceptible
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.440]   to the same things as you pointed out,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.320]   and perhaps in some ways more susceptible
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.040]   because they've got a less subscriber base, less brand.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.800]   So Fox News is gonna be fine.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.840]   New York Times is gonna be fine.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.120]   But as we saw this past week,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.720]   the Russians put $10 million into a little slush fund
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   and then gave it to--
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.600]   - You're gonna start with Saks again?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.120]   - For, no, no, I'm not talking to Saks.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.880]   I'm talking to Barry.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.720]   - He's talking to Saks through Barry.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.480]   - I thank God I'm not managing these people.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.160]   - Well, no, no, I'm just curious what you're,
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.680]   I mean, these are obviously,
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.360]   as the Russians would call them, the useful idiots,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.800]   but they didn't even know
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.240]   they were getting millions of dollars.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.080]   They didn't ask where it was coming from.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   Obviously you didn't take that money.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.640]   We didn't get offered that money, unfortunately.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.680]   - Otherwise you would have taken it.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.880]   - Yeah, we would have secured that bag immediately.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.560]   - Free money from the Russians?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.280]   - No, we're like the scene in "The Matrix"
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.080]   where Neo's dodging the bullets and one nicks his leg.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.120]   That's the Russian money
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.880]   'cause it was flying everywhere.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.800]   And J. Cal was trying to jump into the bullets.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   - I was trying to collect them.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.120]   - And it's like, it's all we can do to just,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.920]   we wanted to get that sweet, sweet Putin money.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.960]   But what was your, what's your take on this?
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.480]   'Cause you had some strong feelings
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.240]   when I think Tucker went and did his,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.800]   what you thought was propaganda for Putin.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.920]   And so let's talk about how susceptible, in your mind,
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.600]   these voices are to being bought and paid for, apparently.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.040]   - To me, it's less about--
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   - Allegedly.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.960]   - Being bought and paid for.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.560]   I think what it is,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.520]   is there's a really, really understandable risk
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.480]   that once you sort of eject yourself from "The Matrix"
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.680]   or whatever the right metaphor is,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   stop taking the blue pill.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.400]   It's like, once you see one lie,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.240]   all of a sudden it becomes a world of lies.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.080]   And what's to stop you sort of
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.680]   from falling down the rabbit hole?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.640]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   There's certain people, I don't wanna name them,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.880]   who I so admired.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.640]   And I felt like they were really prescient
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.000]   on standing up against sort of the neo-racism
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.040]   from the left, let's say.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.200]   And then all of a sudden I turn around
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.440]   and they're basically talking about how Bill Gates
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.520]   is putting 5G chips in our brain.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.760]   And I think to myself, how did that happen?
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.440]   And I think the way that it happened
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.800]   is a really understandable human impulse,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.480]   which is these people lied to me about this thing.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.320]   Therefore, everything they say is untrue.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:46.560]   Or the Overton window has been narrowed so, so tightly
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.840]   that I'm just gonna bling it open to, I don't know,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.000]   someone that says that Churchill is a villain
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.960]   and the Nazis may have had a point.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.560]   So that's what I think is actually happening more broadly.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   And I think the, I feel oftentimes at the Free Press,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.720]   like we're dancing on the edge of a knife,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   which is to say on one side,
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.440]   you have these institutions that have the poor gatekeeping,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   but at least it's, I mean, they have gatekeeping,
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.560]   they have fact checkers,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.520]   they have this whole system, right, that's corrupt,
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.080]   but at least it was supposed to work at one point.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.560]   And then you have kind of the Wild West world.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   And the Wild West world has everything.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.760]   And so you can see Alex Jones right alongside
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.280]   a fantastic journalist like Megyn Kelly,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   and how are you supposed to know who is who, right?
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   And so that's the challenge, I think,
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.360]   of the new Wild West world.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.320]   And what we're desperately trying to do at the Free Press
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.800]   is to be the bridge.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.240]   And what I mean by that is to marry the standards
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.320]   that you would once expect from a place
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.200]   like the Washington Post or the New York Times.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.400]   In other words, everything is rigorously fact-checked.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.280]   When we get something wrong, we publicly correct it.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.720]   Like all of those old rules,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.600]   but marrying them to the sort of political freedom
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.240]   of the new world.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.960]   - Can you take us into an instance where a contributor,
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.560]   'cause you have a lot of freelance contributors
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.600]   or just important people will want to publish now
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.360]   in the Free Press, which I think is a really good sign
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.760]   for you that you're doing something meaningful,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.840]   that they submit something and you're like,
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.880]   "Okay, this is not actually reporting.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.200]   "This is your opinion on a conspiracy.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.040]   "And we need to maybe get some facts in here
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.680]   "to boister this opinion of yours."
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.120]   Because I mean, these dopes accepted $100,000
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.760]   and never asked it.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.480]   So then people are gonna take their opinion on Ukraine
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.560]   and look at that as factual
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.680]   when they don't even question
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.000]   who gave them $100,000 an episode?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.480]   I mean, these people are obviously idiots/corrupt.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:50.960]   What do you think?
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   - I wish I had read more about this particular story.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.800]   - Well, no, it's infuriating
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.680]   because if somebody were to drop $100,000 on you
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.920]   to republish the Free Press on another website,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.120]   you'd say, "Where's the money coming from?"
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.520]   Correct?
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.560]   - Yeah.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.400]   - And why are we getting free money?
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.720]   - Yeah, we don't get free money,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.640]   probably 'cause I'm too stupid to get free money.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.600]   - No, no, it's the opposite.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.960]   You're too smart so they wouldn't offer it.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.680]   - Maybe.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.440]   I mean, the scenario you're asking me to go into,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.720]   that happens every single day.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.400]   In other words, we're in a really excellent position
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.040]   where we turn down the majority of things
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.240]   that are submitted to us.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.320]   And I think the thing that's really heartening
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.200]   is what our readers reward
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.440]   is the very thing that we were founded to get.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   In other words, when I left the New York Times,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   the Free Press, it was barryweiss.substack.com,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.560]   and it began as a reactionary product, honestly.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.120]   Now it's transformed itself,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.320]   but it began as me being so pissed
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.360]   that they were ignoring and lying about so much.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.080]   And those were the stories that I ran sort of headlong into,
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.120]   mostly institutional capture in the areas of law
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.960]   and medicine and education.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.720]   But just to choose an example,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.200]   a few hours ago, we sent Leighton Woodhouse,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   an amazing reporter.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.640]   I saw, as everyone here did,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   that the 3rd Precinct in Minneapolis
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.240]   during the BLM protests and rioting burned to the ground
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.320]   and the cops abandoned that station.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.000]   And I wondered, what do the cops in the 3rd Precinct,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   what do the small business owners there,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.360]   what do they think about Tim Walz?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.880]   Now that is a natural story that in a normal time,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.680]   the New York Times would report on immediately
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.000]   when he was chosen, but they didn't.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.360]   And so then we sent Leighton,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.440]   and he interviewed two dozen police officers
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.880]   and small business owners,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.680]   and that is the kind of thing that our readers want.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   They want new information,
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.200]   soberly presented and brilliantly written.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.760]   They want really high quality things.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.440]   And to me, that's one of the things
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.040]   about building the business has been the most heartening.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.400]   David Sachs has not said a word.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.680]   Well, let me, I can actually,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.000]   let me agree with a few things you said.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.040]   So first of all, I agree with you
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.680]   that the mainstream media is not just biased,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.560]   it's just like all propaganda all the time.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.240]   And the turning point for me in realizing this was COVID,
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.480]   I think before COVID, I realized that, yeah,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.680]   the mainstream media is largely consists of liberals,
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.440]   so they're gonna have a liberal bias.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.600]   What we saw during COVID was that
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.840]   they were even lying about science, right?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.720]   It wasn't just politics, it's like everything.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.440]   You know, we were told that the pandemic
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.040]   was a pandemic of the unvaccinated,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.880]   even though, even if you got the,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.000]   what they were calling the vaccine,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.680]   it didn't actually stop the spread.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.120]   You go on and on that, you know,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.440]   we had to basically do social distancing,
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   except when the riots of 2020 happened,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.840]   then you're allowed to go outside and actually participate
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.520]   because it's a social justice cause,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.040]   so therefore the health changes.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.160]   I mean, it was like on and on.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.000]   - No church, but you can go to a protest.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.360]   - Right, right. - No surfing.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.160]   - So it was like, for me, it became so obvious
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.080]   that the media is just, again, it goes way beyond bias.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.160]   You know, it's like, it's just all wrong.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.920]   Now at the same time, I think that you do raise a good point,
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.160]   which is once you're outside the world
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.520]   of the prestige media, yeah, you are kind of on your own.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   - You're naked. - You're on independent
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.640]   platforms.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.360]   I use X to try and figure out, you know,
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.320]   who I should listen to.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.120]   And the way I do it is I compare who said what
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.200]   compared to what actually happened.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.280]   So like, who ended up being right about the issues?
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.880]   And then I will follow them more,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.200]   and I will de-follow the people who are wrong.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.720]   It's really simple.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.480]   For example, on the issue of Ukraine,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.160]   the number one quoted source in the mainstream media
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.840]   is a think tank called the Institute for the Study of War.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.440]   It's basically a neocon-funded think tank
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.240]   who are the relatives of Victoria Nuland,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.440]   who was the architect of our policy in Ukraine.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.520]   Everything they've written over the past two and a half years
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.200]   about Ukraine has been proven wrong.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.120]   They said that the summer counter-offensive
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.040]   last summer was going to be a giant victory.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.720]   It ended up being a disaster.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.160]   - Sorry, these are her relatives you're saying?
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.040]   - Her relatives.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.840]   And the mainstream media, the New York Times and so on,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.120]   quotes ISW.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.560]   If you go look at the citations,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.440]   it is the single most cited authority
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.160]   by the mainstream media,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.760]   and they are consistently wrong.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.600]   Who was right about the summer counter-offensive?
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.360]   Well, I was, for example.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.000]   - While we're handing out credit.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.960]   - And I certainly didn't need to be paid by the Russians.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   I just figured out what the truth was.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.440]   Okay, J. Cal?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.560]   So, you know, you bring up these, you know,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.080]   these stories about Russian influence or whatever.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.640]   The real influence operation in this country
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.320]   is by the mainstream media.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.880]   They're the ones who are spreading disinformation
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.520]   about the war in Ukraine and so many other issues
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.360]   on a scale that dwarfs
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.840]   what any of these like handful of podcasters
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.040]   that most people have never heard of
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.200]   can ever hope to accomplish.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.280]   So in any event, I agree with you.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.920]   - When's the foreign policy panel at this conference
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.720]   and can I join it?
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   - Well, yeah, we're going to do.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.320]   - Meir Scheimer and Sachs.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.440]   - Jeffrey Sachs.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.320]   - Meir Scheimer and Sachs.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.680]   Sachs on Sachs on Meir Scheimer.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.000]   - Well, look, I would, well, we're having,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   yeah, John Meir Scheimer and Jeffrey Sachs
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.040]   are speaking tomorrow.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.720]   So they're doing a tete-a-tete.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.920]   But yeah, if you want to stick around
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.000]   and we could have, maybe you and John,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.040]   we can work that out.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:17.840]   - I have a question.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.600]   - You've got some time right now.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.640]   - Right now?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.360]   - You know what I mean?
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.480]   - No, no, go on.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.840]   - Last year--
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.080]   - This would be like a many hours conversation.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.240]   - Well, last year, one of the most popular
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   things to come out of this
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.200]   was a talk about regulatory capture by Bill Gurley.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.120]   And you mentioned that the first thing,
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.000]   Bill Gurley, someone--
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.000]   - That's cheering for Bill and not regulatory capture.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.720]   - Cheering for Bill.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.480]   - Yeah, he's great.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   - But you said that when you left the Times,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.560]   you threw yourself sort of like headfirst
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.920]   into the regulatory capture of the law
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.040]   and medicine and whatnot.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.480]   What did you learn?
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.760]   - I wouldn't say regulatory capture.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.040]   I would say ideological capture.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.000]   - Ideological capture.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.800]   Okay, so what did you learn?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.920]   - Yeah, well, I mean, we've published so much on this.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.240]   But basically the way in which institutions
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.840]   intended for one purpose
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.920]   have come to serve another one or another god.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.640]   And in the case of medicine,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.320]   which I would think would be
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.080]   maybe the most alarming in the law,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.480]   not actually intending,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.200]   I mean, the purpose of medicine is to do no harm.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.640]   And yet all of a sudden in many hospitals
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.560]   and medical schools across the country,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.000]   people were being told to do something very different,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.480]   to mete out care based on race,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.200]   to shuffle young teenage girls,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   especially toward irreversible changes in their bodies
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.120]   and things of that nature.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.800]   So a lot of it comes back to the fundamental theme
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.040]   we've been sort of encircling in this conversation,
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.400]   which is that ideological change that's happened.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.280]   And I think just to go back
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.040]   to where we began this conversation,
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.800]   it's like, where did all this come from?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.520]   I don't think it's possible to understand these changes
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.480]   and like the rebel alliance maybe
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.560]   that's risen up against it
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   without talking about technology
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.960]   and the reality that we,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.000]   like 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.600]   I would have just left the New York Times
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   and just maybe opened a diner
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.040]   and done something completely different.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.120]   This would not have been available to me.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.920]   And it's kind of unbelievable
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   what's been made possible by technology.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.360]   I mean, I'm not someone who,
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.120]   I've never managed a person in my life.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.480]   I never raised money in my life.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.240]   I never imagined I'd be an entrepreneur.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.000]   I can barely log into Substack.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.120]   And now I have a company with 50 full-time employees.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:41.760]   It's unbelievable.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.800]   - That's amazing.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.600]   Congratulations.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.640]   - That's founder mode.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   - That's the real founder mode.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.000]   - And I would just add that,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   what the truth is on any particular issue
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   is not always obvious.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.080]   It's a process to figure it out.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.320]   And so we have to have these alternatives
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.680]   in order to debate the issues
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   and then arrive at the truth.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.280]   And you, again, compare what people said
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.240]   to what actually happens.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.560]   And you try to figure out who you can trust.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.720]   And the good news is that today
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.760]   we have these alternatives.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.120]   We have alternative media,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.640]   of which your major part,
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.400]   All in Pod is a major part.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.880]   And I think these alternatives are building
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.280]   in reaction to basically the corruption
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.080]   of the mainstream media,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.600]   which I think you're spot on about.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.840]   - I think that the challenge,
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.600]   at least I'll say for the free press,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.160]   is there are a lot of people out there
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.520]   who their goal,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.200]   and they're doing it beautifully,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.600]   is to make a lot of money really quickly
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.240]   and to be very influential as one man bands.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   What we are trying to do
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.720]   is something much more long-term.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.160]   We are trying in an age
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.400]   where no one trusts institutions anymore
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.440]   and they only trust individuals and influencers
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.240]   to stealthily build an institution.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.120]   And what that requires is a kind of discipline
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.640]   to give up, and we do.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   A lot of things that would really stuff our pockets
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.960]   in the short term, not the Russians,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.760]   but other things,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.320]   for the sake of building
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.640]   what is to us the thing of the most value,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.320]   which is trust with the audience.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.400]   And they, I believe, see us doing that
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.760]   and see us publishing things
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.600]   that might enrage them,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.640]   that they might disagree with,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.440]   that might provoke them.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.000]   And we think that that's just a part of,
