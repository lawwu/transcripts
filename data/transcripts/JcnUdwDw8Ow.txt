[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   (applause)
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.000]   You can sign them.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.920]   I want to introduce this great panel here.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.240]   Mike Piper is here.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.340]   Many of you know Mike.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.420]   He's a phenomenal resource for so many of us.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.020]   Mike is the treasurer of the John C. Bogle
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.020]   Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.420]   He is an invaluable resource to the Center.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.700]   He's a CPA, and he also offers hourly consultations
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.360]   on retirement taxes and investments.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.640]   Mike, quick question, are you still accepting new
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   clients for that sort of work?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.000]   Mostly no.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.740]   My schedule is very limited just because, as most of
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.420]   you know, most of my time is spent writing and doing
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.620]   the work related to that.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920]   So, my capacity is pretty limited.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.280]   Okay.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.560]   Mike has a fabulous blog, Oblivious Investor, and
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.260]   he also has written a number of super helpful
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.400]   small books on single topics.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   So, social security and tax planning are big areas
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.040]   of expertise for Mike.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040]   His latest was called More Than Enough, and it's a
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280]   great resource for people whose retirements are
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280]   well-funded, but they're thinking bigger picture.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.420]   Mike has also created a wonderful social security
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.280]   calculator that I think many of you know.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.880]   It's called Open Social Security.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   I'm seeing nods out there, which is great.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.020]   John Luskin is also here.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.580]   John is an hourly financial planner.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.860]   John, too, is on our board for the John C.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.360]   Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   He co-hosts the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, or
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.540]   at least he was doing it for a good period this
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.240]   summer while Rick was on his sabbatical sojourn in
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300]   Alaska.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.880]   John also hosts the Bogleheads Twitter spaces
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380]   and is a great resource for many of us in the realm
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.660]   of retirement planning and investment planning.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.740]   Last but not least, Wade Fow is here.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.220]   We're very privileged to have Wade here.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.080]   You all probably saw Wade in the general session
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.120]   just before lunch.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.760]   Wade is a professor, researcher.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.960]   His Retirement Planning Guidebook is the resource,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.200]   in my opinion.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.060]   If you're looking to buy a single book that covers
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.700]   every important topic under the umbrella of
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.100]   retirement planning, that's your book.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.280]   And I had a friend recently reach out to me and say,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.940]   "I've heard you talk about this book.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.520]   Is it good for novices?"
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.180]   And I would say if you're serious about retirement
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.520]   planning, you owe it to yourself to get Wade's book.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.980]   So, I want to get into the substance of the
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.260]   conversation, starting with retirement today and
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.920]   thinking about pre-retirees or people who expect to
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.840]   retire maybe within the next year or two.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.740]   How's their timing right now?
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.500]   Wade?
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.540]   >> So, certainly it has never been a better time
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.420]   to access a variety of low-cost, do-it-yourself
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.520]   investment options.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.280]   So, certainly investors have that going for them.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.620]   I think about a case that Mike makes with respect to
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.720]   investing.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.520]   I know you have your own 80/20 single fund that you
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.300]   use in tax advantage accounts.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.960]   And there's no reason why retirees can't use a
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.740]   similar type of fund where they put all their money
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.260]   in once and it rebalances for them.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.040]   It's just zero maintenance.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.940]   It's low cost.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's a very great set-and-forget investing
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.680]   approach.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.780]   Maybe 80/20 isn't the right mix for retirees, but
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.580]   Vanguard does have some other mixes in those life
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.880]   strategy funds.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.920]   And even for taxable accounts, iShares, they
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.080]   have their line of tax-efficient ETFs, their
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.260]   allocation ETFs, which also could be a good fit, too.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.220]   So, insofar as investing complexity, you don't need
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.900]   it.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.100]   There's a lot of great solutions out there.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.700]   And then even retirement planning, there's some
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.160]   great do-it-yourself tools for retirement planning.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.560]   We interviewed Stephen Chen recently on the Global
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.340]   Heads on Investing podcast.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.640]   We talked about do-it-yourself retirement
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.540]   planning tech.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.840]   So, there are really some phenomenal resources for
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080]   do-it-yourself retirement planning, financial
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   planning, and investing out right now.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.540]   Okay.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.480]   And I should note, Steve Chen is here in the
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.240]   audience.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.120]   Maybe not in this room, but he is here at the
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.780]   conference.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.220]   I think one obvious point that we've been talking
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.920]   about the last couple of days is inflation-adjusted
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.880]   interest rates being high makes it a lot easier to
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.960]   feel comfortable spending at any given level from
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.420]   the portfolio than when inflation-adjusted
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.500]   interest rates are very low.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.520]   So, in that sense, now is a good time to be a
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.260]   retiree.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.460]   And I would definitely second that point.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.260]   The real interest rate is really important.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.780]   And then just to have a different answer also,
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.980]   there's some good news on the horizon in the
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.080]   Medicare prescription drug world.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.080]   In 2024 now, there's no more catastrophic phase
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.580]   where the - if your drug insurance costs - I'm
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.420]   sorry - prescription drug costs are getting too
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.760]   high, there was an unlimited window on how
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.520]   high those could go.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.560]   The catastrophic phase is gone in 2024.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.120]   And then in 2025, there will be a $2,000 cap on
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.500]   out-of-pocket expenses related to prescription
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.400]   drugs.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.900]   So, if you go with original Medicare plus the
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   Plan G Comprehensive Supplement, and then now
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.860]   with this out-of-pocket limit on prescription
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.700]   drugs, you can predict pretty well what your
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.540]   potential insurance - or your health care costs
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.440]   will be in retirement.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.020]   And that can help manage a significant spending
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.640]   shock of, "I don't know what kind of health care
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.740]   bills I will face."
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.620]   There is a way now, increasingly, to be able
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.220]   to manage that better.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.620]   So, I wanted to mention Alan Roth is here in the
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.280]   room.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760]   And Alan will be taking questions and collating
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.620]   them and he's right there.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.520]   He just raised his hand.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.720]   So, if you've got a question, write it on a
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.120]   piece of paper and hand it to Alan and he'll take a
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   look and hand us the best ones.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.800]   Mike, I wanted to ask you about the Social Security
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.940]   Adjustment that was just announced, the inflation
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.600]   adjustment.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.500]   Can you talk about that?
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.240]   It came on a day when the new inflation number was
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.740]   above that 3.2 percent inflation adjustment.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.420]   Maybe you can give us a little bit of background
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.980]   on how they come up with that.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.360]   3.2, right?
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's looking at quarterly CPI figures, basically.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.400]   And it's not - it's essentially inflation over
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.460]   the last year, except it's a lag.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.060]   It's not a calendar year.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.640]   That's really the gist of it.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   So, on the one hand, that's a lower adjustment than
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.140]   we've seen in the last couple of years.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.620]   And so, that might feel like it's bad news because
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.840]   you didn't get as much of a raise, but it's because
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.640]   there wasn't as much inflation and that is good
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.320]   news.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.020]   So, you know, it's good and bad news, however you
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.560]   look at it.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.760]   And the CPI number can be a little bit different
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.820]   because usually when we talk about inflation, we're
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.620]   talking about the CPI-U index.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.360]   That's the mainstream what the media is talking about.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   Social Security actually uses something called
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.840]   CPI-W, which is Urban and Clerical Workers, and it
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.440]   can be a little bit different.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.880]   That's why the announcement of what the
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.300]   overall inflation was over the 12-month lag period
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.280]   can be different from what the Social Security
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.440]   goal is.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.120]   Okay.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.820]   So, you just addressed some of the positive tail
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.280]   winds for new retirees.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.680]   How about things that you perceive as headwinds?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.520]   Certainly one thing I think about is elder abuse,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.200]   fraud.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   You know, there's a whole industry where we have
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.160]   these robo-scam calls and Social Security benefits
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.540]   have been suspended or your grandchild has been
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.100]   kidnapped, you know, what have you, they're in a
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.280]   jail in Mexico, you know, send us $10,000, haul it
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.840]   out in a book in the mail.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.080]   So, that's certainly going to be a really big
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.880]   challenge, especially as we get older and we're not
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.140]   quite as sharp as we used to be.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.220]   Navigating those challenges is going to be
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.060]   quite a lot for retirees.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.060]   And the best solution there is, you know, have
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.100]   that resource, you know, set up that financial
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.240]   power of attorney, have those trusted parties
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.040]   that are going to help you manage your finances when
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.940]   eventually you may not be able to do so yourself.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.040]   Seems like that's an argument for simplifying
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.180]   a financial plan too, right, as you age?
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.880]   Okay.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.720]   You all work with clients to varying degrees.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.220]   How do you help them when you have a new client who
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.620]   comes in and says, can I retire and when can I
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.280]   retire?
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.100]   What are the key things that you put on the
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.520]   dashboard and what's sort of the exercise that you
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   take them through?
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:40.700]   I think since we can't know what the future holds in
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.280]   terms of investment returns, inflation and
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.900]   life expectancy and taxes, I think it's always
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.080]   important to have some flexibility baked into a
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.220]   retirement plan.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.040]   And for some folks, maybe that means working
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.180]   longer, maybe that means possibly working part
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.760]   time, but for pretty much everyone, that's going to
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   mean having some flexibility with your
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.180]   spending.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.620]   The probably easier way to do this is to put off
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.260]   big expenses during years of poor market
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.920]   performance.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.860]   So, if you have a bad year in the market, maybe it
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.360]   means you'll buy a new car next year.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.400]   Maybe it means you'll do the home renovation next
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.060]   year.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.900]   Maybe it means you'll make that big spend in a year
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.780]   that the market hasn't performed poorly.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.000]   But having some wiggle room in your spending,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.700]   that's going to be critical to any retirement plan
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.320]   regardless of what metric or technique you use in
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.980]   putting that plan together.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.820]   In terms of trying to assess, do you have
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.080]   enough, are you ready to retire financially
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.060]   speaking, a lot of the approach out there has
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.360]   been like you do a Monte Carlo simulation and look
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.120]   at the probability of success.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.000]   I've really become more enamored or comfortable
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.200]   with a funded ratio approach, which is
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.100]   basically you assume your investments are going to
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.340]   earn a basic rate of return.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.580]   You can link it to tips.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.400]   So, you use tips as the underlying discount rate
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.140]   in the analysis and then you add up, well, what are
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.140]   all my liabilities?
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.140]   What are the goals I have for retirement?
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.320]   My expenses, if I have a legacy goal, what I want
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.180]   to have set aside as reserves for spending
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.620]   shocks and so forth.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.020]   And then you start adding up all your assets as
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.860]   well, the different investment accounts,
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.020]   Social Security as an income stream, other
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.120]   pensions, that sort of thing.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.800]   And then you calculate the present value of all this
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.160]   using the simple interest rate that's not assuming
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.000]   stock market risk.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.140]   It's just, can my plan work without taking risk as a
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.740]   starting point?
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.780]   And you look at how much assets do I have compared
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.480]   to liabilities?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.040]   And if your funded ratio is over 100 percent, that's a
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.220]   pretty good indication that you can start thinking
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.360]   that you're in a pretty comfortable place, that you
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.260]   have what you need to successfully retire and to
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.560]   also meet the kinds of spending shocks that you
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.500]   want to be prepared for.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.920]   Like, do I want to plan for a specific long-term care
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.100]   event or that sort of thing?
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.700]   >> I do like the funded ratio concept a lot, just
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.100]   like Wade.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.300]   My primary approach is Monte Carlo analysis, and
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.940]   that's not honestly because I think that's the best
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.640]   approach and it's better than all of the others.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.740]   It's just what I use.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.420]   I think there's other good approaches also.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.220]   If you are using Monte Carlo analysis, the big
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.420]   output number it's going to give you is probability
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.980]   of success, just like Wade said, and that's
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.080]   important.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.220]   But you also want to look at a number of other
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.100]   metrics.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.060]   So, in the failure scenarios, when did failure
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.740]   occur?
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.400]   Right?
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.940]   Did it occur at age 73 or at age 98?
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.080]   And that's a big difference.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.280]   And so, we want to look at other metrics as well as,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.780]   you know, remaining portfolio value in the
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.420]   median case or the 75th percentile case and 25th
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.120]   percentile case and so on.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.580]   And so, I think I am a big fan of Monte Carlo
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.580]   analysis, but I definitely don't think that you need
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.860]   to look at it from a lot of different points of
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.360]   view, not just the probability of success
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.020]   basically.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.300]   Well, I wanted to follow up on that probability of
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.600]   success point because it is an important dimension
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.440]   of the Monte Carlo analysis.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.140]   In the simulations that we run in our retirement
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.300]   income research at Morningstar, we use 90
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.180]   percent probability as kind of the baseline or the
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.580]   target case, and we sometimes hear pushback,
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.980]   especially from individual investors who say, "No, I
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.140]   want 100.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.860]   I want 100 percent chance of - 100 percent of odds
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.420]   of not running out of money."
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.100]   Can you all discuss the pros and cons of sort of
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.820]   what is - if you're using Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.460]   what is a decent success rate to target?
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.800]   So, on the Longview podcast, Christine
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.280]   interviewed Derek Tharp several months ago.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.500]   I don't know when exactly, but go look that episode
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.180]   up.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.840]   It's excellent.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.740]   The thing he talks about is if you are going to do a
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.520]   one-time analysis, you're going to make a single
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.320]   plan and then just not change the plan at all, no
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   matter what happens, then yeah, you do want a super,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   super high probability of success.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.620]   But if you're willing to update it every single
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.540]   year, maybe adjust our spending a little bit this
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.100]   way, a little bit that way, then a somewhat lower
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.440]   probability of success can be very reasonable.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.840]   And exactly, you know, I'm using fuzzy words here,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.500]   right?
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.740]   A high probability of success, a somewhat lower
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.380]   probability of success.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.680]   And what those words will mean to one person is
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.340]   different than to another person, because when we
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.180]   talk about risk tolerance, classically we're talking
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.920]   about, oh, how volatile is my portfolio?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.280]   And that's a real sort of risk tolerance, but this
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.360]   is the real risk tolerance, is how okay am I with
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   needing to change my life because of something that
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.660]   happened in the markets?
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.720]   And so, the right answer for one person is simply not
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.800]   going to be the right answer for another person.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.620]   >> Yeah, and it relates to like not just of the
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.400]   portfolio itself, because the probability of
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.000]   success, the software is not, probably not assuming
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   any sort of spending adjustments.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.940]   So, it's really if you don't change your spending at
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.740]   all, what's the probability that you'll
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.400]   deplete?
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.340]   The reality is, as you get closer to running out of
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.780]   money, you're probably going to adjust spending and
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.440]   that can help.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.020]   So, it's not like necessarily the catastrophic
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.120]   scenario.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.180]   Plus, you may have other resources outside of the
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.560]   investment portfolio that speak to, if I have
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.260]   plenty of my Social Security is a big one, but
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.260]   other reliable income outside the portfolio, if I
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260]   have some flexibility for my spending and so forth,
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.740]   there's two ways to be aggressive in retirement.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.940]   You can invest aggressively and you can spend more
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.040]   aggressively.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.540]   And if you spend more aggressively, you'll have
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.900]   a lower probability of success, but you may be
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.000]   willing to take on a lower probability of success
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.040]   because you can make these adjustments and it's not
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.180]   catastrophic necessarily if you deplete your assets
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.420]   because you do have other spending resources outside
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.080]   of that.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.560]   So, 90 percent is often the default, but in a real
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.660]   world case with somebody who's got some flexibility
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.160]   and so forth, you might be able to talk about like a
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.900]   70 or 80 percent success rate target because you're
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.120]   going to be adjusting that, as Mike said, over time.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.600]   Yeah, certainly for that 90 percent success rate, that
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.300]   can be a reasonable way to do it.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.000]   And I use the word reasonable as a keyword
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.040]   there because none of this is guaranteed.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.940]   Whether you're doing a Monte Carlo simulation or a
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.840]   funded ratio or anything else, it's going to be a
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.200]   little bit of a broken record.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.540]   You want to have that flexibility baked into your
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.240]   retirement plan because that 90 percent success
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   rate, that's going to be based upon some guess
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.420]   about future taxes, some guess about future
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.720]   inflation, some guess about future investment
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.660]   return, life expectancy, et cetera.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.160]   And if any of those guesses are wrong, well, now your
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.220]   results are wrong.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.100]   That's why, again, it's so important to have
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.200]   flexibility baked into your retirement plan.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.100]   So, one question I've been thinking a lot about based
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.540]   on my interactions with actual retirees is that
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.840]   people who have been diligent savers throughout
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.640]   their lives oftentimes have a really difficult
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.000]   time transitioning into spending mode and a
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.400]   difficult time giving themselves permission to
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.940]   spend from what they've managed to save.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.480]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.040]   Okay.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.220]   So, I'd like to hear from the panel about how people
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.500]   should get themselves over that hump.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.100]   Wade, I noticed you mentioned in the
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.460]   preceding session the role of an annuity in this
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.160]   context.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.300]   I guess a question I have based on that is if
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.700]   someone is having trouble spending from their
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.960]   portfolio, it seems like it could be really
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.780]   difficult for them to part with a substantial share
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.800]   of the portfolio to put into that annuity in the
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.480]   first place.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   But, anyway, maybe you can tackle that question.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.940]   Yeah, and I'll try to actually answer the
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.980]   question without referring to an annuity.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.640]   Okay.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.720]   So, you've got - there's - like the pair - like
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.660]   Aesop's Fables, you've got ants and grasshoppers,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.320]   right?
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.360]   The ants are preparing for the winter.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.500]   The grasshopper is out having fun.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.200]   I think a lot of bogleheads tend to be ants.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.660]   And what the whole retirement world is
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.060]   telling you is you've been an ant your whole life.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.440]   You're not supposed to flip a switch at
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.340]   retirement and become a grasshopper and enjoy
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.000]   yourself.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.200]   And you're supposed to spend more money.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.080]   And that can be hard if you're fundamentally
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.740]   frugal.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.340]   You don't necessarily get satisfaction out of just
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.180]   spending more money just because you can.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.620]   So, part of it is just recognizing what your
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.780]   lifestyle is and if you're comfortable spending
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.960]   what you're spending.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.060]   Just because you could spend more doesn't
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.360]   necessarily mean you have to spend more.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.320]   But the other angle of that, too, I think one of
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.900]   the big drivers of this idea that people are
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.640]   worried about spending money relates to this
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.900]   health care concern or long-term care concern.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.940]   It's like I'm worried I can't spend my money
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.900]   because I'm worried I may need it for a big
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.800]   nursing home stay in the future.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.120]   And I think the way to help with that
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.360]   consideration is I like to talk about assets as
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.300]   reliable income, diversified portfolio, and
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.960]   reserve assets.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.140]   And reserve assets are what you have that's not
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.840]   been earmarked to something else.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.360]   And so, if you can kind of work through this and
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.640]   say, well, I do have a home or I do have some
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.340]   surplus assets over here.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.480]   I do have something that I can call reserves that if
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.780]   I do have a significant long-term care shock,
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.240]   I'll be able to use that to help fund the
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.640]   long-term care need.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.980]   If you can actually picture that in your mind,
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.880]   that may be a way to make it easier to then go
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.920]   ahead and spend some of those assets because
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.120]   you're not like overwhelmed by I've got
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.120]   this one pot of assets that I need to use for
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.760]   everything and I'm worried about spending it.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.420]   You can say there's some reserve assets on the
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.100]   side that can help manage that type of spending shock.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.940]   >> Sounds like a bucket.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   I want to stick with the long-term care question
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.240]   because I had it last in my queue, but since Wade
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.100]   brought it up, I would like to hear from the
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.280]   panel about how they think people should address the
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.420]   long-term care risk.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.620]   So, Wade just referenced the idea of having a
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.920]   separate silo of assets that you could use.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   I'm guessing that probably a lot of folks in this
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.400]   room have gone that route, the self-funding route.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.300]   But I'd like to hear the panel's thoughts on
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.260]   insurance products, specifically the hybrid
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.040]   type products.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   And one of the most compelling arguments I've
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.440]   heard in favor of them is Carolyn McClanahan made
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.800]   the point to me that families that she's known
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.880]   who have had hybrid long-term care life
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.120]   policies have been more able to use the benefit
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.520]   than they would feel to spend on long-term care,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.460]   that they would have been reluctant to invade their
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.760]   portfolio to get the care that they needed, which I
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.660]   thought sounded like a pretty compelling argument.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.800]   Yeah, so certainly you want to look at your total
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.320]   assets and figure out, is it reasonable for you to
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.560]   self-fund or not?
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   And the folks that I work with, sometimes they've
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.740]   got way more money they can possibly ever spend,
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.360]   especially if they're the aunts who have trouble
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.640]   moving to that grasshopper stage of life.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.100]   And so, for them, self-funding can be
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.780]   reasonable.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.300]   But one consideration there that I do want to add is
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.920]   that if you are going to self-fund for the
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.440]   possibility of long-term care, you want to think
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   about investing appropriately.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.260]   That's to say, hey, you might need long-term care
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.760]   tomorrow, so perhaps investing very
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.560]   aggressively with your portfolio isn't going to
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.900]   help you best self-fund.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.000]   Alternatively, for those folks who don't have
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   enough assets, long-term care insurance, as tough
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.800]   of a bullet as it might be to bite, it can help
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.500]   manage risk.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.040]   I've got a bias towards managing risk, so using
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.100]   the right insurance product can help.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.080]   Now, generally, I like a pure insurance product as
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.820]   opposed to a hybrid product because it's going
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.720]   to be a better deal.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.420]   But if there's some, you know, human behavioral
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.060]   issues in there and it's, you know, don't buy that
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.180]   pure long-term care insurance or nothing at
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.760]   all or, you know, buy that hybrid product, then I
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.160]   guess I'll prefer the client buy the hybrid
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.220]   product in that situation.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.540]   >> So insurance works best when it's a low
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.300]   probability but high-cost scenario we're trying to
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.640]   insure against.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.140]   Long-term care is a high-cost scenario, but
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.340]   it's not a low probability event.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.440]   That's the issue.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.140]   It's very hard for traditional long-term
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.740]   care insurance to be affordable at a
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.060]   reasonable premium just because the odds of
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   somebody actually using the benefits are
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.400]   relatively high, at least compared to other types of
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.820]   insurance out there.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.100]   So there are the different hybrid options that
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.520]   combine either a life insurance or annuity with
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.300]   long-term care.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.160]   They can work.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.800]   Like, I'm not a big fan of them or necessarily I
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.700]   don't think they're a bad idea.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.840]   But to the point you made, Christine, there can be
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.600]   value in at least having some sort of small policy
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.380]   in place, both for the reason you mentioned
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.620]   where a lot of times someone might be thinking
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.940]   of self-fund, but then when the time comes, they
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.220]   feel worried about spending their children's legacy
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.380]   or inheritance, and so they don't get the care
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.060]   that they need.
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.980]   And nobody's worried about spending the insurance
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.660]   company's money.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.120]   So if you have the policy, at least it helps get
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.360]   you moved towards getting the care that you need.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.440]   The other thing is also a lot of policies have a
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.340]   care coordination benefit where there will be a
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.980]   professional who will help you find the services
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.840]   you need, which may be otherwise very difficult
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.940]   because when you need long-term care, you're
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.680]   probably going to have a hard time figuring that
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.480]   out, what you need specifically, and it's a
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   big burden for other family members as well.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.120]   So having a care coordination benefit as
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.360]   part of a policy can help get you to the right
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.020]   institution, help get you the care you need, and
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.600]   help get you going down the road in a correct
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.540]   direction in a manner that's not burdening your
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.740]   family to such an extent.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.180]   >> So going back to the self-funding folks, in
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.340]   terms of how to invest, John, you referenced
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.880]   that, but I'd like to talk about how big that fund
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.540]   should be.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.980]   So say you're a married couple, how much you
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.420]   should set aside or a single person, and then
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.500]   also where to silo those long-term care assets?
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.400]   What's the best account type if I'm thinking of
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.660]   earmarking a portion of my portfolio for long-term
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.740]   care expenses that I'll pay out of pocket?
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:09.220]   >> As far as amount, that's going to depend
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.120]   significantly on where you live because the cost of
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.020]   long-term care is dramatically different
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.660]   from New York City to a more rural location.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.420]   So that's what I would do.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.720]   I would simply research what is the cost where I
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.660]   live and looking at studies, because there are
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.060]   studies, but also looking at specific facilities
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.600]   literally where you live, not just at the state
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.140]   level, but in your local area.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.900]   And this is a facility that I could see myself
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.340]   living in, how much does it cost?
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.920]   Like that's the shopping we want to do, not just
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.220]   looking at, you know, a paper that somebody put out.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.780]   As far as the account, that's a tricky one
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.520]   because we don't know when it's going to happen.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.060]   So frankly, I don't, at least what I'm discussing
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.860]   this with clients, I don't treat it any
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.200]   differently than any other spending in that regard
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.340]   because the only way that we could make a very
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.800]   good decision is if we could predict exactly when
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.980]   you will need it, and we can't.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.480]   So I don't separate out a separate portion and say
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.840]   this amount in this account is the long-term
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.520]   care bucket.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.720]   I don't do that.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.080]   >> Yeah, to echo Mike's point, insofar as, you
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.720]   know, this account is for this goal, et cetera, I
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   don't necessarily do that because you can just buy
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.260]   whatever investment you've sold back from another
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.760]   account, so you don't necessarily have to do
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.500]   that compartmentalization.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.840]   Insofar as the cost, you want to be looking at,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.540]   you know, setting aside whatever amount to
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.680]   something that you might get for an equivalent
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.880]   benefit of purchasing a long-term care insurance
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.540]   policy.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.340]   So if you're looking at maybe a $300,000
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.080]   long-term care insurance policy benefit that you
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.520]   would purchase, that wouldn't be an
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.320]   unreasonable amount to set aside.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.060]   And then, touching a little bit more about that
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.500]   investing component, because you might need as
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.960]   much as $100,000 in that first year if you're in a
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.220]   moderately - insofar as the facilities of a
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.100]   long-term care facility, your portfolio should be
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.200]   not very aggressively invested, because if you
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.860]   have to take a $100,000 distribution, it's
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.100]   probably not a tiny part of your portfolio, and you
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.080]   don't want to be doing that during some poor
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.840]   market returns.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.740]   So investing appropriately, relatively
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.480]   conservatively, if you're going to self-fund for
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.420]   at least that portion of your portfolio, it helps
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.320]   better ensure that money is going to be there when
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.320]   you need it.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.320]   Can we go back to the ants and grasshoppers for just
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.980]   one second?
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.660]   Sure.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.320]   Thank you.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.460]   So this is something that people ask all the time,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.720]   is, you know, I'm not comfortable spending for
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.760]   my portfolio.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.960]   And relatedly, a question that I get a lot is just
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.160]   the "Can I retire?"
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.940]   question, and a lot of times, as soon as I dig
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.800]   into the math, you could have retired seven years
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.480]   ago.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.140]   (Laughter.)
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.080]   And when that's the situation, that's - I
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.540]   mean, that is the bogal head prototype,
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.220]   honestly.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.420]   Like, when that's the case, if you're still
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.420]   feeling anxiety about it, having somebody else tell
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.920]   you that, yes, you could retire, could help.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.960]   But there's also a very real chance that what's
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.760]   going on here is not about your portfolio, right?
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.700]   It's about something inside you.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.460]   And so, I mean, I mentioned this in my most
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.380]   recent book, and I didn't know how people would
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.840]   receive it, but it's gone over well, so I'll say it
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.780]   here, too, and that is mental health care is a
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.840]   good thing, right?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.140]   I mean, I've been through counseling.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.840]   Most of my loved ones have, too.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.320]   It's very valuable.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.920]   And if you're feeling intense anxiety, and
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.060]   there's simply nothing in your finances that should
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.260]   be causing you anxiety because you've really got
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.300]   these things taken care of from a purely financial
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.260]   point of view, looking into mental health care is a
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.940]   good idea.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.160]   And people are scared about it.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.440]   And I will tell you, it is a low-risk proposition
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.780]   because you're going to spend about one hour.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.280]   The person is being paid to be nice to you, and
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.940]   that's it.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.480]   It doesn't cost that much for one session.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.840]   So, if that's a thing, a situation you're in, the
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.220]   solution frequently is not a financial solution.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.660]   It's something else.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.720]   That's good advice, Mike.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.380]   Thank you.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.560]   I wanted to, Mike, go back to your book more than
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.460]   enough because you and I had a conversation about
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.260]   that, and we talked about this idea of sort of
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.160]   consumption.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.600]   People hear that they should be spending more,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.440]   and it doesn't have to be on themselves.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.200]   And you made the point that it can make a bigger
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.840]   impact on kids for them to inherit some money from
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.140]   you when they're younger, when they're launching,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.320]   when they're buying their first home or trying to
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.080]   decide whether to go back to grad school.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.140]   Can you expand on that?
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.780]   Another thing we see in bubbleheads - you see it
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.320]   on the forum all the time - is people who have done a
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.480]   great job saving and investing through their
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.920]   careers, and then at age 65, they inherit a big
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.660]   lump sum from their parents.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.900]   And at that point, it doesn't do anything for
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.560]   them.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.900]   And if we think about it, that's honestly just kind
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.500]   of how the math works.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.980]   The age most people are when they have kids, the
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.280]   age to which most people live, your kids - kids,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.720]   they're not kids anymore at that point.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.340]   They're most likely to be inheriting this money at a
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.680]   point where they're already financially
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.740]   independent.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:36.820]   And so, doing this giving a much smaller amount can
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.500]   be very much more impactful at an earlier age.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.560]   You know, whether that's - it could be the home
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.240]   down payment money for their first house.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.700]   It could be the helping to pay off student loans.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.840]   And so, if your kids are already past those points
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.540]   - now we're talking about grandkids - but those
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.580]   things, even if they're smaller amounts, can be
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.680]   just enormously impactful in a way that even a mid
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.840]   seven-figure inheritance isn't.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:11.920]   I want to switch back to portfolio structure, and
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.160]   we touched heavily on investing in the first
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.860]   half of today.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.160]   But I'd like to go back to bonds, because I think
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.000]   many of us have heard that we should have bonds in
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.660]   our retirement, pre-retirement portfolios,
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.640]   and yet bonds have just behaved terribly over the
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   past year and a half.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.680]   They've been very disappointing in the face
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.840]   of rising interest rates, doing exactly what we
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.380]   would expect them to do, but nonetheless unwelcome.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.480]   So, can you talk about how investors should think
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.120]   about bonds, especially relative to cash, with
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.380]   cash yields looking so attractive, it's very hard
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.520]   to get excited about parking a portion of my
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.760]   portfolio in something that could have losses,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.260]   when I can lock in almost five percent without any
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.700]   risk of at least near-term loss.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.140]   Rick Ferry talked about this earlier in a little
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.140]   group, so I'll paraphrase him, because he said the
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.000]   point well, is that adding bonds to your portfolio
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.240]   don't mean nothing bad is going to happen, it just
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.640]   decreases the risk that something bad does
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.320]   happen.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.120]   So, much of investing, nothing is guaranteed.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.380]   If we look at the S&P 500, for example, from March
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.960]   of 2000 to March of 2009, it offered a negative
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.060]   return.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.960]   So, now, we're certainly not throwing out the S&P
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.740]   500 from our portfolio, but investing takes time.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.500]   All asset classes, all different types of
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.200]   investments have their day in the sun.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.280]   As Jack Vogel would say, we just need to stay the
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:38.940]   course.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:44.820]   One thing I'll just add is that if you're looking at
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.740]   cash, you're not locking in that rate.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.880]   That's how cash works, right?
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.380]   The interest rate changes, whereas - so, the reason
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.780]   you might be inclined to stick with intermediate
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.720]   term bonds or something other than cash is
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.060]   because you would be locking in that rate for a
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.200]   longer period of time.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.060]   That doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea,
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.440]   but that is the tradeoff that you're making.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.660]   Yes, so, relatedly, it seems like a lot of
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.240]   financial advisors I talk to have found religion
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.500]   about not taking risk with fixed income, that
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.380]   they're all governments, they're all short-term.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.780]   Is that a reasonable way to think about it?
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.920]   It seems like the assertion that I hear is
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.980]   that this is not a portion of the portfolio you
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.380]   want to take risks with.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.760]   What's the case for venturing out on the
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.820]   maturity spectrum, at least?
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.560]   So, I'm the one who doesn't really like
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.500]   traditional bonds for the retirement income
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.160]   portfolio.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.140]   So, it's - you've got tips, and one case for a
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.840]   longer term tips wouldn't be just a tips fund with
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.640]   a long duration, but if you're laddering bonds,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.600]   if you want 10 years of expenses, inflation
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.540]   adjusted, you could build yourself a 10-year tips
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.200]   ladder.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.220]   If you want 30 years, you could build yourself a
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.880]   30-year tips ladder.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.320]   That would be a reason, when you look at what's
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.780]   the duration on my 30-year tips ladder, it's going
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   to be high, but as an individual household
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.720]   investor, you're not exposed to that interest
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.400]   rate risk.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.860]   If you really are truly planning to hold those
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.840]   bonds to maturity and spend those proceeds when
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   they mature, that can be the justification for
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.880]   going towards a longer duration.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.480]   But even with all the retirement income
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.900]   research out there, Bill Bingen looked at the
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.880]   different - you use treasury bills, you use
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.680]   intermediate term bonds, you use long-term bonds.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.020]   Long-term bonds are just too volatile relative to
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.460]   any additional yield they may provide.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.060]   Treasury - T-bills were a little bit - they're less
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.820]   volatile, but not enough yield.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.500]   He found that the sweet spot was the
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.720]   intermediate term government bonds, and that's
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.500]   about a five-year maturity.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.000]   So, that's really what the research is pointing to.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.760]   Now, right now, if you want to go less than five
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.300]   years, I do think maybe you're venturing into
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.640]   market timing a little bit with that, moving away
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.380]   from whatever the standard approach is.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.640]   But yeah, and then otherwise, again, just if
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.320]   you're using bond ladders, that would be the way to
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.860]   start thinking about going to a longer duration
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.220]   with your bonds.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.560]   >> So, I've been hearing a lot about bond ladders
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.660]   during this conference, and a question I have is
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.560]   sort of - and they touched on it in the previous
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:25.340]   session - but the bond versus bond fund, and can
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.780]   part of that be addressed by just buying the right
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.480]   maturity bond fund?
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.320]   Can part of the risks associated with owning a
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.340]   bond fund relate to just having the right time
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.620]   horizon in mind for that bond fund?
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.100]   >> So, it's mathematically possible that you can
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.000]   duration match your bond fund to the liability
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.540]   you're trying to fund, but your retirement spending
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.040]   goal liability, that's going to have a fluctuating
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.700]   duration.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   And so, in practice, it becomes very difficult to
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.540]   duration match your bond fund to the liability
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.380]   that you're trying to fund.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.440]   There are a few commercial companies that
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.520]   have provided a solution, but even then, they have
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.080]   to assume things like, well, is it a 25-year
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.280]   retirement or what the case will be?
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.160]   So, yes, in theory, you could try to use a bond
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.420]   fund to duration match the liability in your
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.360]   retirement that you're trying to fund.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.900]   In practice, it's a very heavy-duty math problem to
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.840]   try to solve, and very few companies even offer
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.540]   solutions trying to do that.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.720]   >> So, certainly doing a Treasury ladder or a TIPS
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.020]   ladder isn't unreasonable, yet, to be a little bit
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.120]   of a broken record, I always encourage folks to
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.860]   think about the complexity of the investment plan
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.660]   that they're going to put in place.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.220]   Yes, you could do that, but I want you to consider,
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.600]   if you're making a 30-year ladder, and maybe you're
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.400]   in your 60s now, that means you're managing this
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.740]   thing into your 90s.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.640]   Is that something that you want to be doing?
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.700]   And then, you also should have some considerations
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.400]   about your legacy investment plan.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.940]   Maybe you love a bond ladder, but maybe your
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.700]   spouse doesn't.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.980]   So, yes, it is one way to do it, and it's certainly
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.140]   reasonable, but I always want to encourage folks
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.920]   to keep it simple.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.580]   Again, there's some really great zero-maintenance
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.420]   funds out there that have bonds of various
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.220]   maturities that, when you look at the total bonds
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.460]   that are in a bond ladder, aren't going to be too
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.500]   dissimilar from what you're going to get in a fund.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.900]   >> We will be taking questions.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.700]   Alan Roth is collecting your cards, so raise your
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.480]   hand if you have a question that you would
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.080]   like to turn over to Alan.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.240]   I wanted to ask about taxes, and I think we could
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.340]   do this whole session on tax planning during and
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.740]   leading up to retirement.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.680]   But I'd like to ask about people who are in the
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.920]   home stretch maybe five years before retirement.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.380]   They're trying to decide what account types to
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.460]   prioritize if they're saving, which ones they
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.860]   should fund.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.600]   Mike, maybe you can talk about how to triangulate
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.060]   that question, whether to make traditional tax
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.160]   deferred contributions or Roth contributions at
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.340]   that life stage.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.500]   >> Sure.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.900]   The answer there is actually the exact same
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.680]   answer it's been your whole career that you've had
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.340]   access to Roth and tax deferred anyway, which is
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.840]   it depends on the tax rate that you expect to be
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.780]   paying whenever these dollars come out of the
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.860]   account later as compared to the tax rate that would
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.500]   apply now, like what rate of tax savings would you
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.420]   get on tax deferred contributions.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.560]   So, it's the exact same question.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.000]   The only thing is that the circumstances, the
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.040]   inputs are different because A, your income in
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.540]   the years, at least for a lot of people, in the
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.340]   years immediately preceding retirement is
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.580]   often the highest it's been, not necessarily
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.440]   for some people, you know, you're scaling back.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.940]   But the higher your rate of income, the more
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.420]   appealing tax deferred contributions become.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.660]   But on the other hand, the closer you get towards
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.380]   retirement, the better we can see what did the
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.160]   account balances look like.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.560]   And I know that for a lot of people, especially in
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.720]   the boomer generation where you had access to tax
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.760]   deferred for a good number of years before you had
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.960]   access to Roth at all.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.800]   And when you did first get access to Roth, it was
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.100]   Roth IRAs with a tiny contribution limit.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.740]   And so, for so many people in this room, you've got
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.940]   big tax deferred balances and much less big Roth
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.640]   balances.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.740]   And so, that kind of starting to tell you the
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.020]   story of what the retirement tax rates going
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:21.680]   to look like.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.820]   It's going to be higher than you might have guessed
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.680]   20 years ago when you first started, you know, or
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.060]   however many years ago when you first decided to
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.920]   start contributing to tax deferred accounts.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.360]   And so, once we start to get that sense that, boy,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   there's a lot of tax deferred balances here and
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.500]   the tax rate in retirement is likely to be higher,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.900]   then suddenly we're looking at Roth.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:48.640]   So, I did the presentation on this yesterday.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.580]   It was like a fire hose, but I don't know if I ever
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.980]   really articulated, like, what you are actually
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.720]   doing.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   So, the kind of, for me, the tax efficient
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.980]   drawdown strategy with this is, while you still
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.020]   have taxable funds, you cover your spending needs
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.080]   through the taxable account, and then you're
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.400]   looking to see if on top of that you can do Roth
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.860]   conversions and pay taxes from the taxable account
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.720]   on those Roth conversions.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.300]   And that's what's happening until the
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   taxable account depletes.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.600]   Then you switch over to, you now need to cover your
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.580]   spending needs through the IRA, the tax deferred
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.580]   account, and you're managing the tax threshold
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.980]   of, well, maybe you can meet all your spending
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.820]   needs and still do a Roth conversion.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.180]   It's going to be a lot harder at that point
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.840]   because you've got to cover your spending needs
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.760]   through the IRA first, and that's generating a lot
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.220]   of taxable income.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.420]   But if, otherwise, if the tax bracket you're
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.500]   managing is lower, you may, you're going to blend
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.820]   between the tax deferred account and the Roth to
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.120]   cover your spending needs.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.360]   So, part of your spending comes from the IRA, the
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.100]   rest will come from the Roth.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.160]   And then when we're talking about, well,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.640]   what's the efficient tax rate to manage?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.440]   The answer is partly driven by the tax rate
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.200]   that's efficient to manage is what's going to be
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.580]   allowing you to smooth distributions from the
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.720]   tax deferred and Roth accounts throughout your
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.520]   entire retirement so that you maintain that
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   capacity to manage the particular level of
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.620]   income that you wanted to manage for that.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:18.960]   Just to add one tiny point, because everything
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.040]   there is exactly how I would put it.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.980]   I'll just add that it's, you're trying, ideally,
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.180]   not just to smooth the tax rate through your
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.400]   retirement, but also retirement and the ten
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.980]   years after you pass away because that's, frankly,
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.380]   when a lot of the money is going to be coming out
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.720]   of the account, most likely.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.760]   And then, of course, we're looking at somebody else's
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.360]   tax rate or some, plural, somebody else's tax rate.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.700]   And we started to talk a little bit about giving
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.500]   and one important question there is charitable
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.240]   giving to the extent that you're planning on
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.500]   leaving assets to the nonprofit, then that future
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.940]   tax rate is zero and that has a huge impact on all
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.700]   of these retirement tax planning decisions that
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.380]   we make.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.940]   If a chunk of the money is going to be coming out
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.740]   later at a zero percent rate, that affects all of
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.820]   this math.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.480]   Great point.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.780]   And I would just note the Bogle Center is, indeed,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.760]   a not-for-profit, a 501(c)(3).
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.720]   Now we're on to the good questions.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.400]   Should you pay off your home before retirement?
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.940]   And just really quick, that's boglecenter.org/donate.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.800]   Thank you, John.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.440]   So, going back to, we touched on, hey, if I'm
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.880]   going to have long-term care expenses and there's
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.140]   going to be a big distribution, again,
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.620]   $100,000 maybe in that first year I need long-term
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.260]   care because that stuff, those facilities are
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.580]   expensive, you want to be investing not very
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.660]   aggressively because you're going to need that money
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.360]   to come out, ideally, not during a market
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.020]   correction.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.120]   If there is a market correction, you want your
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.600]   portfolio less impacted and investing more
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.340]   conservatively helps ensure that.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.540]   So, it's going to be the same thing with the
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.600]   decision to pay off that mortgage because if you
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.900]   don't pay off the mortgage and now there's a market
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.080]   correction, that means that's a bigger amount
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.140]   that has to come out of the portfolio during a
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:11.820]   market drawdown.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.340]   It's that mortgage payment.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.780]   So, by not having that mortgage payment, now you
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.480]   don't have to take out as much of your portfolio
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.960]   during a market drawdown.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.320]   So, paying off your mortgage is a risk
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.860]   management strategy in retirement.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.760]   That's what folks want to be thinking about with
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.520]   respect to, hey, should I pay this thing off or
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.460]   it's not.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.500]   So, how do rising yields figure into this because
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.700]   many people now have mortgage interest rates
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.840]   that are well below what they could get on very
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.080]   safe securities?
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.840]   Yeah, so if you're looking at your total
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.320]   portfolio, the total portfolio performance,
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.360]   again, let's think about that one single balance
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.040]   fund.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.800]   I'm going to keep my investments simple.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.400]   Your portfolio is still going to be down
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.840]   regardless of what you're getting on the bonds.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.700]   So, to manage risk, to avoid having to spend
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.300]   more from your portfolio when the market is down,
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:05.380]   you don't want to have that mortgage payment.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.660]   If your mortgage rate is 3% and cash or bonds are
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:15.260]   yielding 5-ish, it's not super appealing to
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.360]   eliminate 5% yielding investments to pay down
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.900]   3% interest rate.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.040]   On the other hand, for anybody who has a new
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.100]   mortgage, and so it's a 7 point whatever percent
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.200]   interest rate, that's, you know, the math is
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.000]   exactly the opposite.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.680]   Yeah, okay.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.520]   Mike, can you talk about your funded ratio Excel?
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.680]   Sure, so this is just an article I wrote a while
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.880]   ago that just explained the funded ratio concept,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.320]   which is what Wade was talking about.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.880]   And frankly, Wade is a much deeper expert in this
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.020]   concept than I am.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.160]   In the article, I just made a very, very quick
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.700]   spreadsheet to illustrate the way that the math
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.940]   works, just so you can see how it works in Excel if
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.900]   you're an Excel sort of person.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.840]   Wade has built an actual application, which
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.580]   includes tax calculations and on and on.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.480]   And so, the spreadsheet is basically an
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.580]   illustration of how funded ratio math works.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.420]   That's what I would say.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.460]   But I think really, if we want to hear more about
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.260]   funded ratio, Wade is definitely the person.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:26.260]   At Retirement Researcher, we do quarterly
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.320]   retirement income challenges.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.600]   A lot of local heads have joined them.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.100]   They're free and it's a week-long thing and you
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.260]   have access to our funded ratio tool during the
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.340]   week and you're free to use it for the week.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.940]   And run your plan and all that sort of thing.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.280]   And it's no obligation involved.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.340]   Just kind of leave it there as a plug.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.440]   Okay.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.940]   Here's another household capital allocation question.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.180]   My husband retired three years ago and I have three
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.120]   or four years before I retire.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.220]   Does it make sense for me to keep contributing to
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:57.320]   my 401(k) while my husband is taking from his IRA?
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.260]   I can't get a grasp on what to do.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.320]   We are debt free.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   Sorry, could you repeat the scenario?
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.560]   Yes, she is contributing to her 401(k), still
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.240]   working.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.600]   Husband is retired and pulling from his IRA to
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.240]   maybe meet additional living expenses that they
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.140]   need above and beyond her income.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.820]   And is it wise for them to continue down this path?
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.280]   Knowing that we can't provide anyone with
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.220]   specific advice knowing that we don't know their
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.020]   whole situation.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.680]   Sure.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.620]   So in that case, basically all we're doing is
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.720]   we're swapping IRA dollars for 401(k) dollars.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.860]   They're both tax deferred in that sense.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.100]   It's a wash and 401(k) dollars can become IRA
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.660]   dollars later.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.760]   So I guess a couple of concepts there that might
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.660]   apply is that 401(k)s have better asset
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.640]   protection in terms of if you get sued, that might
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.040]   be relevant, might not be relevant to your
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.700]   household.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.040]   Another point that is relevant I guess also as I
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.140]   just think about this is that we're not only
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.720]   swapping IRA for 401(k) but we're swapping his
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.660]   for hers.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.600]   And so if they're different ages, then that
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.960]   could be relevant also potentially.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.540]   But it's probably really not that big of a
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.100]   decision, frankly.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.940]   It's not changing that much to go from one
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.200]   account to the other, especially once you're
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.740]   already retired and you've got the ability to move
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.580]   the money between them.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:26.340]   Oh, yes.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.880]   Then that for sure.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.540]   Right.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.220]   That's a great point.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.420]   If there is a match in the 401(k), we still
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.720]   definitely want to be getting at least that
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.380]   match.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.120]   Excellent.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.660]   And related to what Mike said too, if she's
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.200]   younger, that would be a way to help defer R&Ds
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.500]   into the future as well.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.900]   Yeah, good point.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   You know, related to this, Jamie Hopkins, who's a
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.500]   retirement guy, made a point to me that for some
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.640]   people, the greater good is actually to stop
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.820]   contributing to their retirement plans if it
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.340]   can help them continue to work longer.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.120]   If they can spend what they would otherwise save
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.920]   and that makes them - just gives them a better
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.380]   quality of life.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.160]   John, you're nodding.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.860]   Have you run into this with clients?
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.920]   The math is certainly there because if the
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.020]   option A is, A, I retire and now I'm pulling $100
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.460]   grand out from my portfolio, or option B is
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.040]   I'm just not going to put $10 grand in more next
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.280]   year, then certainly not taking $100 grand out,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.000]   that's going to increase the odds of your
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:29.680]   retirement plan.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.580]   So if someone's looking at that decision and their
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.520]   retirement plan needs some work, they're not really
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.780]   fully funded, that could be a very reasonable way
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.460]   to go.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.560]   Yeah, just the best way to get a retirement plan on
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.160]   track is to work longer.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.000]   Just what you're doing with that is it's another year
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.560]   of work, so more time for your savings to grow, a
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.800]   shorter than subsequent retirement horizon.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.840]   You may be increasing your Social Security benefit
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.680]   as well by working longer.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.780]   So at the end of the day, if doing this idea of
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.580]   taking it, don't contribute to your
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.520]   savings, but instead take a vacation and then that
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   allows you to work longer, yes, financially that
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.120]   would be better than worrying that you didn't
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.260]   make the full contribution to your retirement plan.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.960]   Question related to long-term care.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.260]   My long-term care insurance premium is going
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.160]   up for the fourth time.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.200]   Is there a product available where the costs
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.260]   are more predictable?
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.840]   Does anyone have any specific knowledge of, I
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.640]   assume this is like a pure long-term care
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.800]   insurance policy.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.480]   Yeah, that's where the hybrid products usually
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.220]   have guaranteed premiums and part of the whole
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.920]   effort to create those in the first place was this
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.320]   issue that with traditional long-term care,
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.880]   premiums can be increased over time and that's
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.560]   what's tended to happen.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.920]   So that is one of the selling points of the
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.460]   hybrid products is that you are guaranteed not to
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.200]   have premium increases in the future.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.560]   I don't know the scenario at this point about
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.460]   switching to something else.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.940]   You really have to do the analysis at that point,
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.540]   but that's an option.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.380]   Do any of you have experience with switching
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.120]   from a pure life insurance product to a hybrid
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.320]   product doing, you know, 1035 exchange from one to
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.420]   the other?
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:16.080]   No?
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.180]   Not personal experience, but that is another point.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.880]   When I mentioned in the previous session I got a
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.160]   whole life policy and I didn't realize it when I
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.160]   was purchasing it, but it has an acceleration of
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.560]   death benefit rider that if I have a long-term care
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.260]   need, I can - it's not a hybrid policy,
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.140]   but I can accelerate to receive the death benefit
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.060]   to pay for long-term care needs.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.600]   So that - you may have something like that
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.280]   already.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.700]   You might want to check your life insurance,
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:44.680]   but if not, you can do the 1035 exchange where you
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.580]   switch from one life insurance policy to
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.180]   another, including these hybrid policies,
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.960]   without creating a taxable event.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.280]   So I assume this is from someone who is already
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.020]   retired.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.960]   The question is for each year,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.220]   would it be better to withdraw once a year,
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.720]   semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly?
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.600]   Any thoughts on sort of the cadence of
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.960]   distributions?
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.940]   So again, I've got that bias for simplicity.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.500]   Make it easy on yourself.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.940]   Do it once a year and then, you know,
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.780]   go live your life.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.740]   Don't, you know, look at your portfolio every
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.920]   month.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   Mathematically, obviously, in theory,
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.520]   the longer you leave your assets invested,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.420]   the greater the return will be.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.620]   But if we're talking about leaving them invested for
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.620]   a few more months for a relatively small amount
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.320]   because it's just a few months of spending,
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.380]   it's not a big difference.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.460]   A lot of the research just assumes you take out
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.060]   once a year at the start of the year because it's
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.020]   using annual data.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.300]   But the reality is you might smooth that over
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:46.960]   time.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.460]   And also, just if you're spending the qualified
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.880]   dividends and interest payments and so forth,
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.700]   that may be an automatic way over time of
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.280]   replenishing your checking account by having those
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.180]   payments go there rather than necessarily
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.520]   reinvesting them when you're in the
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.780]   retirement phase.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.520]   Okay.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.860]   Here's a question to end on.
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.060]   Best DIY tools for pre-retirement and
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.900]   retirement income planning?
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.600]   Wade's book is great, but I don't want to build
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.560]   ground-up spreadsheets from the ground up.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.200]   So, quick, maybe lightning round here.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.140]   What are your favorite go-to tools that are maybe
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.240]   free or, you know, very nominal charge or even
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   maybe some that charge a little bit more that you
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.320]   think are worthwhile?
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:31.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.380]   So, a bit of a broken record.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.860]   So, I care less about the exact tool that you use,
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.820]   but understand that this is just one calculator
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.220]   making a whole bunch of silly guesses about the
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.260]   future that probably aren't going to all come
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:43.920]   out.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.900]   So, regardless of what tool you have, again,
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.800]   understand that if all doesn't go according to
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.100]   plan, you might have to change it.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.260]   So, expect to make changes to your plan.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.940]   That's going to be way more important than
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.240]   whatever tool that you use.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.040]   Unfortunately, I don't have a very
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.120]   satisfactory answer here because the software that
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.380]   I personally use is priced for advisors, and it
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.160]   really wouldn't make sense for somebody to pay that
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.080]   full price themselves just to use it one time.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.600]   New retirement is the one I hear about the most,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.300]   without a doubt, and I don't know if Steve's in
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.760]   the room, but he's in the Bobleheads community.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.800]   He's active here.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.440]   He cares about your input.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.860]   I can't say that I've test driven it thoroughly
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.000]   myself, so I can't say very much, but I hear
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.940]   generally good things.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.380]   Other software that I hear good things about,
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:37.340]   Maxify Planner by Lawrence Kotlikoff, is
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.040]   something I hear universally good things
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.560]   about, and he's a deep subject matter expert on a
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.820]   range of retirement topics.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.280]   Yeah, I will say really quickly that new
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.160]   retirement is quite similar to the very
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.560]   expensive advisor software that's out there, but
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.900]   again, just have flexibility in your plan.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.500]   And on the software, I've been meaning to do a
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.700]   deeper dive into that.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.740]   I haven't yet, but what I have heard from a lot of
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.440]   individuals, so in addition to doing
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   retirement and Maxify, they have the full list of
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.740]   things I've heard good things about.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.920]   Prolana Gold is another software package, and then
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.140]   Flexible Retirement Planner.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.620]   I think all four of those get pretty detailed in
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.520]   the calculations.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.920]   Okay.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.300]   I want to note that we will have a 10-minute break,
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.900]   then we will reconvene in this room for a
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.460]   conversation with Dana Ansbach.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.100]   I want you to join me in thanking Mike and John and
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.100]   Wade here today.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.180]   (Applause)
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.180]   (Applause)
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.420]   (applause)
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.580]   (audience applauding)
