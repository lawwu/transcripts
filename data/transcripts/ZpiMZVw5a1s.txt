[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   One thing we started last year, and I'd like to repeat it again this year, is all these
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.680]   lovely people came here on their own dime, and I'd like to give them a few minutes to
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.280]   either talk about their latest project or something that they find interesting or just
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.840]   something they want to talk about.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.680]   So, Alan, you're down at the end.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.120]   I got my MBA from Kellogg back in 1982, and, you know, I went to school to learn how to
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.080]   beat the market, and along came Bernard Malkiel's random walk down Wall Street.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.000]   You know, Fama French is a little new in investing since then, but behavioral finance is a subject
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   that really excites me.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   I don't know how I graduated thinking that was a logical, rational thing, but I'm using
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.360]   hindsight bias to see that.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.320]   Projects, I'm just starting, writing the book was the hardest thing I ever did.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.080]   I'm a math geek, and Bill Balloon, who I guess is not here, giving me a contract with a due
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.300]   date provided the discipline to do it.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.640]   I'm just starting to get the itch for a second book, which would be a little bit broader
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.640]   than investing and include, you know, all the aspects of financial planning from taxes,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.720]   estate planning, budgeting, in kind of some simple terms, and it would be called something
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   like Roth's Rules of Common Sense, because common sense is not really all that common.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.520]   You know, just a couple of philosophical musings.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.420]   I considered myself unbelievably lucky I didn't have to, I paid $1,550 a year for my medical
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.000]   school tuition, and my graduate school I got for free, and then I started working in 1980,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.160]   and then I sought away some obscene amount of money with the pension rules, and then
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.300]   got these, you know, security returns in the '80s and '90s that were just beyond belief.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.880]   And I sort of felt sorry for, you know, until very recently, for the kids who, you know,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   were dealing, you know, with, you know, coming out with enormous amounts of debt from school,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.180]   you know, with overvalued securities to buy into their, you know, their retirement plans.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.120]   And I sort of, I almost felt guilty about it, but now I don't feel so guilty.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   I think that, you know, someone who's 25 or 35 years old and has sought family money again
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.880]   is going to get, you know, more than agreeable returns, perhaps the kinds of returns that
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   I got.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.120]   I mean, in 1981 you could get 13% CDs, you know, which have a real rate of return of
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.080]   9% or 8%.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.320]   In terms of, you know, where I'm going and what I'm doing, I'm always writing.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.880]   I'm always trying to be on the state writing and learning curve, and I've got to explain
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.840]   to a lot of you I've got a project that I'm working on on communications technology and
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   politics and political power.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.600]   It's about 90, perhaps about 93% done, and hopefully it'll be out next year.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.680]   As far as financial publishing, I don't have any great plans.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.480]   I'm thinking of doing some e-publishing, just, you know, putting out Kindle books on my own.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.880]   Maybe not even books, I mean, you know, somebody explained to me several weeks ago a book is
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   a social contract.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.440]   It's becoming a social construct, and, you know, there's no reason why you can't sell
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:42.400]   10,000 words for, you know, for $2 as easily as you could sell 100,000 words for $25.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   So I may wind up doing little trips and drabs of, you know, encapsulated subjects and doing
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   it that way.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.980]   You find the ones you want, and you leave the ones you don't want.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.980]   Is Mike Piper still here?
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.980]   Mike, are you still in the audience?
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.980]   Where are you?
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.980]   He had to leave.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.980]   Oh, he had to leave.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.980]   Too bad.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.800]   It would be a lot better if I could say this without him being here and embarrassing him.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.000]   Mike is 27 years old, and he is the future of our organization.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.360]   Him and others like him.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.120]   There's some other posters on our Vogelheads board who are in their 20s, their mid-20s,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.200]   and they are dynamo out there, gung-ho Vogelheads, who are helping to spread the word to their
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   group.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   And Mike is unusual.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   The first time I read something that Mike wrote, I thought he was in his mid-40s or
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.920]   50s, even in his 60s, who had been retired, and he turns out to have been about 25 at
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   the time.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.600]   And doing what Bill is talking about, he's publishing small books, and he's financing
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.300]   his -- this is his living, selling his books.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.680]   But the way he's doing it, he's using the internet and the median of the young folks,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.960]   if you will, to get the message out about the Vogelheads, not unlike what we're trying
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.840]   to do on the board, but just taking it to three or four or five or 25 different levels.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.160]   I was at the pleasure of being at a financial bloggers' conference, the very first one that
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.680]   they had a couple of weeks ago, and it was all these 20-somethings out here, and they're
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.040]   all networking and interconnected and doing all this thing, and Mike is in the middle
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.560]   of all that, spreading the Vogelhead message.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.680]   And so he's the future, and the young people are the future of the Vogelheads, and if he
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   was here, I would have recognized him.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.520]   And he's got the right idea with small books, and I think Bill has realized that, and I've
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   realized that.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   And the projects that I might be working on in the future are just going to be -- I was
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   going to have a 300-page book.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.920]   I'd just break it down into three or four 60- to 80-page e-books and sell them for what
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   I'm going to sell them for.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.360]   But in order to try to spread the Vogelhead message, we're doing -- Wiki is fantastic.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.680]   I don't know if you had any chance to look at what we're doing out there with Wiki.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.960]   It's wonderful what they're doing, and now we're on Facebook, and now we've got people
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.400]   like Mike Piper out there spreading the word to the young community.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   I mean, this is the future of the Vogelheads.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.560]   This is spreading the message, and e-technology, if you will, is one way of doing it, and I
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.360]   plan to do what I can.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.040]   So that's what I'm doing, and I just wanted to give credit to the young folks that are
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.440]   here today that are, say, under the age of 40, because you are the future of the Vogelheads.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.560]   I'll second the endorsement of the Wiki site.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.120]   Just before coming here, I sent a message to some of my colleagues at Morningstar.com
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.480]   saying that what you all have done there, I think, has evolved into the most useful,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.680]   deep resource for personal finance on the web.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   So I just think it's an extraordinary achievement.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.400]   I'm sure it'll continue to grow and get even deeper and broader, but what you've done so
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   far is absolutely tremendous.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   I'm honored to be here, honored to be up on this panel.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   As Mel's intro of me alluded to, I spent most of my career at Morningstar focusing on mutual
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.560]   funds and helping people select mutual funds, and the longer I did that, the longer I became
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.280]   convinced that we were just sort of toiling in the margins of people's financial lives.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   So whether they selected the right large growth fund or whatever they did really paled in
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.040]   comparison to did they save enough, did they make semi-sane asset allocation decisions,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.240]   did they not completely undermine their financial plan by selling everything at the wrong moment.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.800]   So I'm really happy in my current role to be able to address a lot of these things,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.960]   to tap resources like a lot of you and external resources and write about a whole lot of topics.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.160]   I write about four or five columns a week and I'm really busy, but tremendously enjoy
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160]   what I'm doing.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.040]   I have become more and more interested in the logistics of retirement planning, so have
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.840]   been writing an awful lot about that.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.960]   Another topic that's of tremendous interest to me is the decline in cognitive functioning
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.880]   as people age and how they must prepare their financial plans for that possibility.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.280]   I know that many of us have experienced that in our own families.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.880]   I'm undergoing that right now with my dad, so it's become front and center with me, and
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.960]   thankfully he has me to help him, but a lot of other elderly folks do not.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.160]   So that has become a real cause of mine, helping people, even dedicated do-it-yourselfers who
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   have been very effective over their lives, helping them prepare for that day that they
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.160]   may not be able to do so.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.760]   So I've been focusing a lot on that.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.080]   It's a sensitive topic.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.680]   I know that some users have gotten a little offended by things that I've written, but
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.200]   I mean well, and I think it's a really important and critically under-discussed topic.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:01.920]   Could I just ask that we recognize once again all of the people who are in the infrastructure
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.280]   of the local heads, the wiki, and Alex, and the stand-up, and whoever else is here who
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:23.220]   are involved in the actual what goes on in the back.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:41.900]   I mean, I'll second that as well.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.900]   Can you hear me?
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   No.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.900]   Thanks.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.900]   Yeah, I'll second that as well.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.300]   I mean, a well-running discussion board or a site is like a tropical garden that needs
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:57.580]   weeding about once every ten minutes, and if you don't weed it, it very quickly becomes
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:06.660]   uninhabitable, and the people on the discussion board who do that really deserve our gratitude.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:17.420]   Well, Rick and Christine both talked about the wiki, and I think that's probably one
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:25.500]   of the most under-utilized and unrecognized resources available, and it is a vast, vast
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.020]   knowledge base.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:36.380]   So I've been using the bully pulpit of Forbes to do a series on the wiki to try to get more
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.020]   recognition for it, and that's one of the nice things.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:47.580]   I really don't like having a deadline, and I told Christine earlier that she's my idol,
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.660]   and I don't know how she does it, adding up column after column after column.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.460]   Every time I log on to Morningstar, there's Christine with a new column, and Laura and
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.860]   I share a column that is a biweekly column, which means Laura writes one week, and then
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.220]   two weeks later, I have to write, which means I'm writing one column a month, and here's
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.700]   Christine batting out what seems like one a day, so I really don't know how you do it.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   It's a lot of work.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.300]   Writing a book is a lot of work, writing columns are a lot of work, especially when you're
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:28.260]   supposed to be retired and playing golf and things like that, but I felt that we were
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:37.340]   given a column at Forbes, and it gives us a choice to spread the word to a lot of people
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:44.820]   who aren't really getting the movement message, so even though it's a chore, I feel that it's
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:55.420]   worth the effort, and that's basically the thing that I love to hate, having a deadline,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.340]   because I thought I packed that in years ago.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.340]   Yes, Alex.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:05.380]   I just want to say something about the wiki, and it's what's, looking at how people are
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:14.380]   using the site, what's an interesting phenomenon is the regular posters, readers, tend not
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.980]   to use the wiki that much, however, in the way the internet works, we're getting more
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.700]   and more traffic from people who have never been to the site, and they do a Google search
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:30.420]   on something, and basically the more complex the query, or something like non-deductible
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.900]   IRA, is leading people to the wiki, so like anything on the internet, if the quality is
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.820]   there, the content is there, it eventually gets found, so there's getting more and more
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:50.740]   traffic on it, so it may not be seen as much on the forum part of it, and we're going to
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:57.300]   be doing something to figure out a way to better integrate the two, or at least make
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.780]   people more aware of it from there, the regular users, but people aren't, there is a lot of
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:09.020]   activity from people reading the stuff, it's just not as visible.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:17.540]   Well that's great, now we'll get back to the Q&A, a question from Alex, what about low-cost
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:24.260]   variable annuities, for someone like Vanguard or TIA, prep to fill out any income gaps in
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.260]   retirement?
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:35.300]   So, you're talking about a variable annuity instead of a, instead of a speed, right?
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:42.740]   I'll kick that off, I'm not sure what the role of a variable annuity in retirement is,
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:51.820]   that's a hard one, I think for certain investors in the saving phase, a low-cost variable annuity
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.340]   can be useful, and here are my criteria for using one, first of all, the person should
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:03.700]   be young, because the compounding advantages of an annuity are greater the longer you are,
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.420]   so the perfect candidate for an annuity is actually one who is 15 years old.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:13.860]   And we've stopped right there for a second, we want to make sure, he's talking about non-qualified
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.500]   annuities, not qualified annuities.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:26.300]   Correct, correct, and so the second criteria is you don't have any space for sheltered
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:32.380]   assets anywhere else, so you don't have enough in your IRAs and in your 401s, okay, if you've
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.580]   got plenty of room in there you certainly don't need a variable annuity, the third thing
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.900]   is it has to be in an asset class which is inherently very tax inefficient, okay, and
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:49.140]   that's junk, and that's REITs, alright, so if you can meet those three criteria I think
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:56.220]   that owning a variable annuity is a reasonable thing to do, but very few people meet that
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.220]   criteria.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.220]   A low-cost variable annuity.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.580]   Yeah, a low-cost one, of course low-cost is part of it, yeah.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:09.220]   I would say almost always no, you're converting a tax-efficient long-term capital investment.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.900]   No, but I'm saying in retirement, not -- Oh, in a retirement, so you want tax deferral
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.900]   within a tax -- No, it's people who just need an income stream that is greater than 3% or
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:28.220]   4% and don't really care about leaving, you know, that's a -- Well, actually it could
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:35.220]   work to leave some money towards an heirs, if there's a low-cost variable annuity, you
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:42.260]   could guarantee yourself that 5% stream in retirement and still leave something for your
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:49.940]   heirs, but you're going to have costs that make, generally speaking, the average mutual
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.940]   fund look cheap.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:58.180]   Well, that's why I asked specifically about TIAA-CRAFT and Vanguard, I mean, I know there's
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:03.580]   a lot of professors, my parents are among them, who are living off of these sorts of
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:11.180]   things with, you know, withdrawal rates that they couldn't have if they were to follow,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.660]   you know, 3% or 3.5% or something, you know.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.380]   Well, what are they investing in now?
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.700]   Well, like TIAA-CRAFT -- No, but I mean, what specifically?
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   TIAA-TRADITIONAL and, you know, like, say, I don't know, there's maybe 70% TIAA-TRADITIONAL,
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.780]   30% CRAFT-STOCK, you know.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.860]   Yeah, but TIAA-CRAFT is kind of a different animal, I mean, they've structured their product
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.820]   inside an annuity, but it's not what I think of when I think of a variable annuity, and
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:46.060]   I use Vanguard variable annuities all the time, but as a 1035 to get into something
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.860]   ugly, into something, you know, much, much, much less ugly, but still not great.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.860]   Yeah, the TIAA-TRADITIONAL, by the way, until about eight months ago, was an amazing deal,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:03.620]   because if you qualify for it, and it means that you had to have received some money at
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.000]   some point in your life from an educational or a public institution, which, you know,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.820]   probably 90% of people would qualify for, and basically you had what amounted to a money
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:18.380]   market that yielded, and still does yield, 3%, and all you had to do was put it inside
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.980]   of an IRA, and money was perfectly liquid, in and out.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.660]   I contacted Vanguard, and my question to the Vanguard people last night was on the variable
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:37.100]   annuity side, because, and we're not going to talk politics or anything here, but if
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.740]   taxes on long-term capital gains go up to an ordinary income tax rate, and taxes on
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:50.060]   dividends from stock go up to an ordinary income tax rate, then all of a sudden, the
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:58.140]   Vanguard variable annuity becomes very attractive on a, for taxable accounts, and we've been
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:04.820]   talking with Vanguard for the last year and a half, and it looked like this could occur,
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:11.340]   could occur, not saying it will, but it could, about how we can structure using, how we can
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.780]   manage accounts at our company, using Vanguard variable annuities, because right now, there's
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.860]   no system at Vanguard to allow money managers to actually manage portfolios of variable
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.580]   annuities in a very efficient way, rather than calling up individually and talking with
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.260]   somebody on the phone and trying to manage 500 client portfolios by committing 500 individual
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.260]   phone calls.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.260]   I mean, it doesn't work.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:41.700]   We are working on the system to allow investment advisors like us to be able to efficiently
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.900]   manage variable annuities, just like we can manage the Vanguard funds, and I think it's
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:55.660]   an important step, I think, if the tax laws change, that would make very low-cost variable
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:02.420]   annuity products particularly attractive in a lot of asset classes, where right now, they're
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   not.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:09.540]   And one other thing that hasn't been tested on, but in a lot of states, variable annuities
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:17.220]   are sheltered from creditors, so there are some people, like, that are subject to lawsuits
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:28.420]   that might consider it doctors, and others who are subject to lawsuits.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.260]   This is a question about small-cap and value and tilting.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:39.180]   Does anyone like to share their thoughts on either a yes or no on tilting?
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.180]   Yes, Al?
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.180]   Sure.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.180]   Okay, there you go.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.180]   Alan, do you use that in your portfolio?
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.180]   Oh, I was going to actually say something.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.180]   I thought you were through.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.180]   Oh, no, and I'm not saying do it.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.180]   All I'm saying is that the core portfolio is made up.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.180]   I mean, I'm not saying, "Oh, you know what?
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.180]   You know what?
