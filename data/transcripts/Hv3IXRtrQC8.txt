[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460]   As you may know, loss of the sense of smell is one of the, if not the earliest sign of neurodegenerative disease.
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.300]   So for example, in Parkinson's disease, there's loss in the sense of smell probably 10 years before any other symptom.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.980]   People have failed to make this a diagnostic tool because it's nonspecific.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.520]   So it's not as if you could come to your doctor and say, "I'm losing my sense of smell," and they'll say, "Oh, early sign of Parkinson's,"
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.320]   because you can have many reasons to lose your sense of smell and so on.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.900]   Olfactory loss, again, is an early sign of neurodegeneration.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.540]   And there's at least one theory, particularly about Alzheimer's disease,
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   suggesting that Alzheimer's may be the result of a pathogen that enters the brain through the olfactory system.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.260]   Interesting.
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.340]   It's not, of course, a mainstream or widely accepted theory of any type,
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.340]   but it just highlights this notion that the nose is a path to our brain.
