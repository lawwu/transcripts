[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.240]   We've all been there.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080]   Maybe you're there right now.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.360]   You see problems in every direction.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320]   As you look at your life, all you can see are the troubles.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800]   You see your sins, your shortcomings, your challenges,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.240]   your relationship struggles,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.600]   and all those places in life that have been long neglected
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.160]   and now need your focused attention.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.480]   It all adds up.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.040]   And now you find yourself in that place,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.920]   tempted to live a life that has shrunk down
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.980]   to the size of your problems.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.400]   Pastor John has been there.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.440]   It's why he took a leave of absence in 2010,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.520]   eight months away from ministry
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.780]   for what he called a soul check.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.240]   Months spent scrutinizing the problems
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.720]   that he saw in his life, his marriage, his worship,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.440]   his fathering, his pastoring, his public life, all of it.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920]   During these searching months,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.160]   he pinpointed five besetting sins within himself,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.400]   problem areas that needed attention.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.760]   He named them, isolated them, and confessed them.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.100]   And he would come to call them an ugly cluster of sins
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.180]   that included selfishness, anger, self-pity,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.560]   quickness to blame, and sullenness.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.760]   We've talked about the season and his personal discoveries
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.760]   on the podcast back in APJs 220, 1227, and 1501.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.320]   It was a significant season in his life.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.600]   But that leave ended at the end of 2010.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.540]   On January 9th, 2011, he preached for the very first time
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.120]   in those many months.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.920]   And he preached on the Lord's Prayer
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.600]   in a sermon titled, "Our Deepest Prayer,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.320]   "Hallowed Be Your Name."
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.260]   In the Lord's Prayer, our Savior teaches us
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.440]   to ask for several things.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.160]   We ask for our daily needs.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.560]   We ask for food, for personal forgiveness
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.460]   from our sins within, for a forgiving spirit
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.000]   to forgive those who sin against us,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120]   and to be kept from sin.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.000]   Our loving Father cares that we pray
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   for all these daily needs.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   But before those requests, we pray for greater things,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.320]   that God's name would be hallowed,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.880]   that his kingdom would come,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.840]   and that his will would be done.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.480]   From this, Pastor John took another important lesson
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.600]   from his leave to explain here he is
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   in that first sermon back coming off his leave,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.080]   referencing his journal of reflections from his time away.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.040]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   - There's something unique about petition number one.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.040]   It's one of a kind in these six petitions.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   Hallowed be your name.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   In this petition, we get the one specific,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.040]   named, subjective response of the human heart
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.780]   that God wants everybody to give.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600]   Hallowing.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.320]   Hallowing.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.000]   That is, you reverence, you sanctify,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   you treasure, you esteem, you respect, you stand in awe.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.880]   This is something that goes on in here.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.600]   It's the one request that names what's supposed
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   to go on in here toward God.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   Name is who he is.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.400]   So when you say, "Hallowed be your name,"
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.920]   you mean, "Hallowed be you."
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.200]   I'm hallowing, treasuring, esteeming, reverencing,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   honoring Yahweh, and he's in and signified by his name.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   So here's another journal entry.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   October 9, "My one great passion."
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.760]   Nothing, and remember writing this sentence.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.440]   I mean, sometimes, I mean, I read it now,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.640]   it just didn't have the same clout it did then.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.040]   God just says things to you, and you feel like
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.080]   a moment of clarity has happened,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.360]   and all the clouds have been blown away,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.080]   and you know something with such crystal clarity.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.280]   You wish it would always be that way.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.520]   (laughs)
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   Nothing is more clear and unmistakable to me
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080]   than that the purpose of the universe
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480]   is for the hallowing of God's name.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.360]   His kingdom comes for that.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.320]   His will is done for that.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.200]   Humans have bred sustained life for that.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   Sins are forgiven for that.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.680]   Temptation is escaped for that.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.720]   If you press up as far as you can go
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.240]   into the mind and the intention and the purpose of God
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   for all things, Petition 1 nails it.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.760]   You can't go any higher.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   You don't hallow God's name because
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.960]   something else better, higher, more important should happen.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   The hallowing of God's name is the termination of everything.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.600]   So he starts with the biggest request of all.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   Pray that that happens in everything.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.280]   So, one last journal entry, October 10.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.720]   You can see the sequence going here as day after day.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.920]   I'm thinking about this.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.080]   I just wrote this prayer.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   Lord, grant that I would, in all my weaknesses
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.880]   and limitations, remain close to the one clear,
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.000]   grand seam of my life, your magnificence.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.120]   Sooner or later in your life, young people, heads up,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.760]   old people know this, sooner or later in your life,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.680]   pressures and problems become almost overwhelming.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.720]   Physical problems, "Give me bread."
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.200]   Relational and mental problems, "Please forgive me."
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.240]   Moral problems, "Don't let me go into that temptation again."
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.000]   And what I want you to see is this.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.520]   You have a father.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.300]   He's a thousand times better than any earthly good father
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.700]   or bad father.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.760]   You have a father.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   And this father cares about every one of those.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.660]   You can't pray about a problem he doesn't know
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.200]   and care about, none, no matter how small they are.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   And he beckons you to come to him
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.600]   and to talk to him in prayer about them
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.760]   because he knows what you need
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.560]   and he's not surprised by anything.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.120]   Now, that's the usual way we attack our problems directly.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.480]   God, help me, got a problem.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.680]   And all the attention begins to focus on the problem.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.300]   And yes, God, you're saying, "Come,"
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.160]   but your life is starting to shrink up
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.480]   around the problem or the set of problems.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   You wake up thinking about it,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.120]   you go to bed thinking about it,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.180]   and your life is shrinking little by little
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.160]   down around this cluster of pain and problems,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.920]   marriage problems or kid problems
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.660]   or health problems or work problems.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.880]   Your life is just shrinking down.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.000]   And all the while you're calling on
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   the last three petitions.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.960]   God, help me.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.680]   I need some bread, I need some money,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.640]   I need some forgiveness, I need some help morally.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.040]   And you're crying out and your life is just shrinking down.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.240]   Now, when I say it that way,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   I don't mean stop doing that, okay?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.320]   I do not mean stop crying out to God.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.240]   I don't mean stop knowing your problems are there
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.520]   and saying, "I need help."
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.160]   I want you to see that God offers you
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.560]   another strategy of victory.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.840]   It's not different.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.800]   That is, it's not contradictory.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.280]   It doesn't replace what I just described,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.960]   but it is indirect.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.860]   It's indirect.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.000]   There's a direct way of,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.920]   "I've got a problem, I'm going after it."
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.120]   And then there's something indirect.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.600]   And here I'm thinking about the first three petitions
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.840]   of the Lord's Prayer.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   God made you to be a part of something big.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.840]   He made you to be a part of something spectacular
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.720]   and magnificent.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.680]   And you're allowing, perhaps,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.000]   you're allowing your life to just shrink down
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.440]   around these problems.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.200]   And God's in it and He's patient, He's loving,
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.360]   and He provides help.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.280]   But I'm just saying there's another strategy,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.840]   there's another way to add,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.560]   it's a supplemental remedy for life.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.680]   Namely, to be drawn up.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   Let yourself be drawn up into the first three petitions
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.640]   of the Lord's Prayer.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.600]   God made you to be a part of hallowing His name
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.000]   and extending His kingdom and seeing His will be done.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.360]   He made you for something magnificent,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.680]   something mundane as well.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.560]   Oh yes, He made that.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.120]   Cares about that, wants you to live there.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   But what we fail to see, I speak from experience,
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.360]   what we fail to see often is that when we lose our grip
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.520]   on the greatness of God and His name and His kingdom
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   and His global will, we lose a divine equilibrium in life
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   and we become increasingly vulnerable
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.080]   to those problems overwhelming us.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   When we lose our grip on His name, His kingdom,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:26.120]   His will, the big, universal, global, glorious,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.160]   awesome, magnificent purposes into which
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.560]   we have been caught up, when we lose our grip on that
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.360]   and life begins to shrink down around
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.920]   even a God-pursued problem solving,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   we lose an equilibrium, a divine equilibrium.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.960]   I've called it ballast before in life, in your boat.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.920]   You've got this little boat and the waves are,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   and you're ballast, heavy and deep.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.400]   And I'm just shifting images here to go up
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.520]   into those first three petitions.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.160]   I'm pleading with you as I close that you not lose your grip
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.080]   on the supremacy and centrality of hallowing
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.280]   the name of God in your life.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.280]   I'm urging you from the Lord's prayer and from experience
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.800]   that you do go to God for bread
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   and you do go to God for forgiveness
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.360]   and you do go to God for overcoming besetting sins
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.240]   and you do go to God to advance His will
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.080]   and to seek His kingdom and you do all of it
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.600]   for the hallowing of His name.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   The great value in your life, in your marriage,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.040]   in your parenting, in your single life,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.280]   in your friendships, in your studies,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.400]   the great value is I will live
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   so that both my heart and other hearts
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.560]   hallow, esteem, reverence, lift up, honor, value,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:03.800]   treasure the name of God over all things.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.120]   Keep your feet on the ground.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.880]   We live there, we will never not live on the ground
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.280]   with its mundane aspects.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.720]   But you may not see it clearly now,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.160]   but I testify and I say from scripture,
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   there is more deliverance, more healing, more joy
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.480]   in that, in the hallowing of God's name
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   as your supreme goal and priority than you ever dreamed.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   It's so indirect, it just feels often irrelevant.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.080]   I've got this massive problem and you're telling me,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.760]   hallow the name of God.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.120]   Yeah, I am.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.080]   It is a request.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.640]   Hallowed be thy name means let your name be hallowed
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.180]   and who needs to do it more?
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.020]   I do.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.120]   It's a global prayer, but it starts right here.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.180]   When I wake up in the morning,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.600]   I'm not hallowing the name of God most mornings.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.440]   I'm thinking about my problems
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.000]   and they seem to be bigger than God.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.880]   So I pray this.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.680]   This is a prayer.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.160]   Isn't that encouraging that Jesus would tell us,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.640]   ask the Father to help you hallow him.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.240]   So I invite you, beckon you, 2011,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.000]   go deep and go high in the Lord's prayer.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   Let him be a sweet, close, tender, warm,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.640]   need meeting, caring father to you.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   And on that, rise up and join him through prayer
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.660]   and life in the seeking of his kingdom
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.640]   and the doing of his will all to the end
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.000]   that his name be hallowed.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.720]   - Powerful, that sermon was preached in January, 2011.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.560]   A sermon titled,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.160]   "Our Deepest Prayer, Hallowed Be Your Name"
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.640]   on the Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6, verses 5 to 15.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.000]   His first sermon back from an eight month leave.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.140]   The whole sermon is on the site right now as always.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.160]   And this clip came from Jessica Clark
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.520]   in Christianburg, Virginia.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.360]   She writes this,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.580]   this clip and entire sermon has completely changed
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.600]   how I approach prayer.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.680]   Learning to petition the hallowing of his name
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.880]   has been one of the greatest blessings in my life
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.300]   and it has lifted my eyes above my circumstances
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.560]   and my trials down here on earth to the glory of God,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.580]   resulting in genuine daily joy in him.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.120]   His words have stuck with me
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.160]   and greatly blessed me over the years.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.000]   That's awesome.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.560]   Thank you, Jessica, for that testimony.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.480]   And thank you for listening to today's sermon clips.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   Our clips are crowdsourced now.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.600]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.940]   like this one from Jessica.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.640]   And we share that clip with the ABJ audience.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.800]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.560]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.360]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.760]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.480]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.080]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.920]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.440]   Well, we have addressed the challenges
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.200]   of being a Christian loner in ABJs 109 and 212.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.680]   A lot of helpful counsel can be found
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.280]   in that pair of episodes, ABJs 109 and 212.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.120]   A listener named Brian heard them
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.960]   and writes in to ask a question that compliments them.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.400]   What would Pastor John say is the difference
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   between being a loner who is a Christian
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.080]   and a loner who fails to love the brothers?
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.280]   As John puts it in 1 John 3:14.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.360]   Is that the same thing?
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.160]   Is being a loner the same thing as being unloving?
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.000]   It's a great question.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.520]   Up next time, I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.040]   and we're joined in studio with Pastor John
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.200]   on Friday for that.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.100]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:07.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
