[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Becoming a Christian is an awakening.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500]   It's an awakening to the pervasiveness of sin.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000]   It's an awakening to the subtleties of the evil.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500]   It's an awakening to our need of Christ.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.000]   And it is also, in a strong sense, an awakening to the meaning behind all of the realities of life.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500]   Without grace, the world desensitizes us.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000]   And it dulls our spiritual vision, and it numbs our spiritual needs,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and it breeds a spiritual ignorance within us.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   So in Christ, we are brought to life, given a tender heart,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and given new levels of sensitivity when it comes, even to the pains of life.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   In a recent sermon in Milwaukee, at the Campus Outreach 2015 New Year's Conference,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   John Piper addressed Paul's testimony in 2 Corinthians 6, verses 8-10,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   where Paul writes about his suffering in these pairs when he writes,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500]   "Through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   we are treated as impostors and yet are true, as unknown and yet well-known,
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.000]   as dying and behold we live, as punished and yet not killed,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   as having nothing yet possessing everything."
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   Building off of Paul's descriptions, here's what John Piper said.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.000]   People see us as impostors, but in spite of that, we are real.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We are virtually unknown in the Roman Empire.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Nobody's. But in spite of that, we are well-known by the one person in the universe who matters.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500]   Third, we're dying, our bodies are wasting away, but in spite of that,
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.000]   our eternal life in Christ is untouchable.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Fourth, we are punished, but in spite of that, God hasn't seen fit yet to take us home.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Fifth, we're sorrowful. We're sorrowful about sin and misery and pain in this world and in ourselves,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.500]   but in spite of that, our joy is unshaken and constant.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   Sixth, we are poor. We have little wealth in this world, but in spite of that,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.000]   we make many rich with the one treasure in the universe that counts more than anything.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.500]   And lastly, we're nothing compared to the lovers of this world. We have nothing.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.000]   In spite of that, we are heirs with Christ of the Father's estate, which means we own everything.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500]   That's the way it works, right? Are we together?
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   In spite of these things, these things stand,
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   which shows that the emphasis is on the second half of all these pairs here,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.500]   including sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.000]   The joy in the Christian's life is the rugged thing, the durable thing, the lasting thing,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.500]   and the sorrow is not the main thing. It's just the real thing.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   One of the most amazing things about becoming a Christian is that awakens you to more sorrow.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   You come to Christ and you're not naive. You suddenly wake up to pain.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   Of course, there's pain for unbelievers, but they don't have any sense of how big it is,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.000]   how horrible it is, how long it can be.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   To be a Christian is to be awake to cancer and birth defects and profound mental disabilities
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.500]   and divorce and child abuse, including abortion and terrorism and earthquakes and tsunamis
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   and racial hostilities and prejudices and white-collar crime and sex trafficking
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   and poverty and hunger and a thousand daily frustrations that make life very hard.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   Every Christian is increasingly sensitized to these things.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   The gospel brings life, right? And living things are awake and alert and touchable by other things,
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   which means welcome to Christ and greater sorrow.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   I don't have a lot of patience with Christian ministries that sell Jesus
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   with the promise that he'll make life easier. He doesn't. I promise you.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   He makes it real. He makes it eternal. And he makes the joy in it indomitable and invincible.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   But so do your sorrows rise. Come to Jesus and learn how to weep.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   The world doesn't know how to weep for lost people. They are one.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   They don't even believe in it. They don't believe in hell.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   They don't see to the bottom of anyone's pain. They see pain. They feel pain.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   But they don't see to the bottom of it. Christians are the saddest people in the world and the happiest.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   Do you feel that? I'm getting this from 2 Corinthians 6, verse 10,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing." Not sequential. Simultaneous. Do you hear it?
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Sorrowful yet always in, in, under, around, sorrow, joy.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   There isn't any other kind in a not yet saved world. Right?
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   If you think, "I've got to have all the sadness out of my life.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   I've got to get all the sorrow and brokenness out of my life. Then I might be happy."
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   You won't have any. You will never get all the sorrow and all the brokenness out of your life.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   The more you love, the more you hurt. So I love this phrase. I love it.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   I don't want to be sad. Frankly, I hate sorrow. I hate it.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   I don't want to cry. I don't want to cry. I don't like crying.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   And I can't control the phone calls that come. The doctor's report.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   The 9-year-old missionary kid who fell on Christmas Day, bumped her head and died.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   We know those people. So the gospel brings life.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   And with life comes sensitivity to reality. And reality is really sad in a not yet saved world.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Amen. That was from John Piper's sermon on December 29, 2015, titled "One Passion,"
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   delivered at the Campus Outreach 2015 New Year's Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
