[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.260]   >> You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.720]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.200]   Have you ever felt like you've hit rock bottom in your career?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   Maybe you're struggling to advance,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880]   or maybe your manager is putting you down.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.940]   Whatever it is, you're struggling to survive.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.160]   In this episode, Jesse, Troy,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.100]   and I talk about our career low points.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.400]   What we did about it,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.860]   and then what we learned from it.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.040]   All right, let's get started.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.080]   >> So timeline-wise, I was at the agency, I got fired.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.840]   I had a period of unemployment,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   which was soul-searching 101,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.380]   and then I finally got a contract job on the client side,
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.000]   which is Logitech, which turned into a full-time employment.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.680]   I'm going to name her here because we've since reconciled,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.840]   so I think it's okay. So Regina was my manager at the time.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.760]   She and I did not get along.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   Prior to her managing me,
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.440]   I reported directly to the director,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.200]   and I was a senior web marketing project manager.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.000]   I started my career in project management,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.240]   that's actually was my wheelhouse.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.280]   When she came in,
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.800]   she started undermining everything.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   I felt like I was thrown on the bus.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.040]   As a matter of fact,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920]   I don't know if you guys know this,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.840]   but we used to have that cafe,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.600]   and it was not a really big cafe.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.360]   She would hold our one-on-ones in that cafe,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.240]   and she would berate me in front of everybody.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   She would call like, "Are you an idiot?"
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.800]   She would say like, "Are you effing kidding me?
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   What the eff was that?" Those are the literal words she would use.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.200]   Like, "Are you stupid? What were you thinking?"
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160]   It killed me, you guys.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.360]   Again, this is coming right off the back of the other agency,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.800]   another female leader.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.440]   And as a matter of fact, the leader of her manager is also female.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.200]   And so I was having this horrible, horrible experience.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   How I turned it around in this case was,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.880]   actually, this is a pivot point in my career,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.360]   because I made a decision.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   I was like, "I am tired."
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   First of all, I'm tired of these 10 cassette tape of self-help tapes.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.320]   I'm done with them.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.680]   And I was like, "I'm tired of someone beating me down."
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   And I knew the quality of my work.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480]   Like, if I talked to my other peers within the marketing team,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.680]   they all said I'm doing good work.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.120]   So there's something misaligned, right?
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.480]   And I tried to have conversations with her to uncover where it's coming from.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.920]   She never volunteered any information.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.760]   It was very guarded.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.320]   I didn't know what conversations were taking place
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.520]   between her and her manager either.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.760]   It was all shielded from me.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.880]   I thought I was being managed out.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.120]   So I decided I'm just going to focus on just doing good work.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.320]   I went up a few gears
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.280]   and I over-indexed on just working hard,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.320]   pushing good work, documentation.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.560]   And at the end of the day, if someone's going to let me go,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.840]   at least I felt good about what I was able to do.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.440]   What ended up happening is there...
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.520]   Again, I don't know all the conversations that took place above me,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.280]   but eventually she got let go.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.320]   That thumbs up from Zoom feels a little inappropriate.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.720]   Coover is the product manager of Zoom.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   I turned it off and it's still happening.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.920]   So she was let go.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.560]   And I heard some of the reasons were
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.240]   the things that she was throwing me under the bus about,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.960]   it didn't jive with the reality of my output.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.400]   And so I think she was exposed in some degrees.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.280]   And I started becoming really successful.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.040]   And then within Logitech, I ended up turning that around
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.200]   and I shifted from the consumer to the B2B side of the business.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.280]   And that's when I really started to thrive.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880]   So I think it's a lesson on just
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.960]   staying true to yourself, having confidence in what you can do.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.600]   And then just, you know, like in the Bible, there's a saying like,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give God what is God's."
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.640]   And the whole idea is like, hey, if you're going to work,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.040]   put everything into that and focus on that.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.680]   And if you're something else, put yourself into that.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.840]   Don't try to blend the two.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   Now what I appreciate about this is,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.400]   so Regina, clearly also during her departure,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   went through some stuff as well.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.120]   She had some difficult conversations with her manager.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.520]   And what I didn't know at the time was
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.240]   some of that was probably being projected down to me.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.160]   I just didn't have the maturity or guidance from any mentors
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.440]   to ask the right questions,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.960]   to figure out what was really going on with the manager.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.800]   I think one of you guys mentioned before,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.320]   like understanding what's going on,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.280]   happening a layer above, your immediate layer and having context.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.400]   That would have been really helpful.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   But she reached out back to me.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   I think it was like a year after it happened.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.120]   Because I think this, she was like, "Go."
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.280]   And then she asked me, "Hey, you know, like,
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.760]   if I ever treated you poorly,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.720]   I apologize because that was happening to me as well."
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.040]   And she was going through her self-realization.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.160]   So I emailed her back.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.000]   I was like, "Regina, it's all good.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   Like, as a matter of fact, your apology
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   gives me a lot of closure.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.240]   So thank you for that."
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.440]   So like, we're not friends,
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.760]   but if I met her at a dog park or whatever,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   I would gladly say hello and start a conversation.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   The other manager, I have no closure over.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.080]   So if I saw her, it would be very awkward.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.640]   And even to this day,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.680]   with the amount of anxiety I built over that,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.440]   I don't know if I have the maturity to handle the conversation
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.120]   without being prepared.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.360]   - Yeah. Well, it wouldn't be worth your time to be, right?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760]   That's the... - Yeah.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.080]   - But yeah, the point of, you know,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.040]   outside of the scope of the work context,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.240]   your relationship with people after the facts,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.600]   years later, can be totally different, right?
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.680]   - Yeah.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.080]   - In the work environment, it's rarely personal.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.280]   That's one thing I've learned, right?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.160]   It's rarely personal.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   Usually there's a lot of external forces
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.840]   that are driving people's behavior, I think.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.520]   - Including your own,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.720]   and that you may not even be in touch with.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.760]   So that's, after 25 years, I can say that,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.800]   you know, it's also easier said than done,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   but like, it rarely has to do with who you are as a person.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.880]   So like, as hard as it is,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.440]   try not to let any of these challenges
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.680]   affect you at your core, 'cause it's not about you.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.320]   - Yeah, and it's critical to your self-development
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.840]   as a human, right?
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.680]   'Cause you learn about your weaknesses,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   you learn about your strengths,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.240]   you learn about resilience.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.600]   I think it takes maturity to be able to process it
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.880]   through some of those lenses,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.000]   but if there's anyone listening to this
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.760]   and you're going through that,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   know that, first of all, whether it's,
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.520]   what is it, imposter syndrome, or whatever it is,
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.280]   like, you're hired because you're good at your job
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.920]   and you know what you're doing.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.320]   And so don't undermine or underestimate your capability.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.800]   However, find out where your opportunity for growth is,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.640]   right?
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.120]   And it's easier to say as, you know,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   since we have more user experience,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   but for people who are younger in their careers,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.200]   where your identity might be tied to your performance,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.000]   know that you bring something to the table,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.080]   but also know that there is always opportunity for growth.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.680]   And I'm kind of curious for you guys,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.880]   you know, like that was my absolute career low point,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.120]   'cause it was tied to performance
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.080]   as well as my sense of self-value.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.360]   Like, what was your low points?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.800]   And like, were you able to turn that around
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.760]   or are you still struggling with it?
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.560]   Like, what's your story?
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.160]   - You wanna go first, Jesse?
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.240]   - Yeah, go for it, Troy.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.360]   - You want me to go?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.640]   - Yeah, go for it.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.680]   - Yeah, so I mean,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.960]   one of the companies I was hired for in digital marketing,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.120]   the first week on the job,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   they fired the CEO and the head of engineering.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   And I ended up being there for three years,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   but it was a incredibly tumultuous three years.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.840]   I had issues with my manager.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.160]   I had issues with trying to understand
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.760]   what my responsibility was.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.640]   I had that situation where I was reporting directly
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.520]   to the CEO for a while.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   And at one point I reported directly to the head of sales
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.840]   who didn't really want marketing under his purview.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:51.760]   A really difficult situation.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.200]   And simultaneously I had my second child
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.160]   and we had made the move up to where I live now,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.560]   up in Sonoma County, North of San Francisco,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   because we wanted to raise our kids in a better place.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.600]   And we were trying to buy a house.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.800]   I eventually, three years later, was laid off.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   And partially looking back,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   like I totally understand why I was laid off,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.760]   because it wasn't because of my skills.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.640]   It was because I was really insecure about it
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.000]   and saying all the wrong things
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.680]   and showing my insecurity
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.240]   rather than just focusing on my work,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.000]   because I fit the profile of what they were trying to do,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.400]   but I couldn't get out of my head.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.160]   And so, I think that the circumstances
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.400]   of having a young family sort of made that
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.000]   an unwinnable situation for me.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I couldn't not be in a constant state of unease
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   and panic at times.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.720]   Looking back, I try to give myself,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.880]   I'm still disappointed that didn't work out
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.200]   because on paper, I felt like I was the perfect candidate
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.640]   and I loved the story of the company
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.600]   that I was working for.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.520]   So it's still, it's been 10 years
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.680]   since all of this played out.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.360]   It's still hard for me to reconcile
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.320]   how it all spiraled from there,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   but there is so much I learned from that trauma.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.400]   And you know what?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.120]   As a family, we found our way out of that.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.720]   I saw the writing on the wall before the layoff
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.480]   and I ended up back in the workplace
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.600]   less than a month after I was laid off
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.840]   because wheels were in motion.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   So I credit myself for having the tenacity
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.320]   despite being devastated at the same time.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   And then I try to reflect back.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.400]   And again, I feel like a little bit of a broken record,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.880]   but when you have a really difficult situation like that,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.160]   the more you can lean into it,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.240]   the more you're gonna learn
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.360]   and the more you're gonna benefit from that later on.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.520]   I learned a lot about future jobs from there,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.840]   what I didn't want.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.160]   And I think that's really important,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.200]   just as important as learning what you want
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.520]   is understanding what you don't want,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   both in a job situation in terms of what you're doing,
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.920]   but also in an organizational structure,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:45.440]   how companies are managed, how divisions are managed.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.840]   So it was an awful time from a work environment.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.120]   It was a great time personally with young kids
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.960]   and a newborn, and I learned a heck of a lot.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   - Thanks, Troy, for sharing that.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.440]   I think I can definitely relate to having a newborn
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.600]   and it really intensifying the level of stress
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.680]   and everything, lack of sleep and all of that.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.120]   And it affects, it affected me.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   I know when my daughter was very young,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.240]   I had real challenges.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   I was at Logitech actually,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.960]   but I got through it somehow.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.080]   I had an experience later on,
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.040]   was a low point in terms of the amount of income
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.880]   I was bringing in.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.240]   I had become a freelancer and I was consulting.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   And so in 2020, at the beginning of 2020,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.120]   before the pandemic shut everything down,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.920]   I had seven clients.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.720]   I was making a considerable amount more
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.920]   than I was making when I was a corporate employee,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.280]   a agency employee.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.240]   And one of my clients,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.520]   the pandemic hit, everything shut down,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.680]   unemployment went way up,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.320]   and I was affected on about half of the business I had.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   And it wasn't always an easy process to go through.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.600]   And in some cases when you know it's coming
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.640]   and maybe the client engagement has run its course
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.080]   and it's time, it's just not working out,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   then it's time to move on and you separate amicably.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.280]   I had one client who I had been working for
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   for about a year in a creative lead capacity,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.560]   and then hired a new manager.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.480]   And this manager was a descendant of William Faulkner.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.760]   And just oddly enough.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.920]   And so I thought when this person was brought on,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.560]   it would be sort of revolutionary for the business,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.640]   but also for the writing team,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.840]   'cause we had like a writer's descendant
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   leading the writing team.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.920]   I didn't build a very strong relationship with her,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   but maybe a month later, and this was right
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.120]   during the week after in San Francisco,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.120]   the mayor called a shelter in place order
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.720]   and then we didn't go into the office anymore.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   And yeah, I get this call to get on a call with HR
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.640]   and the manager and a video call,
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.000]   but she didn't call, she didn't join the video call.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.440]   She just called in by phone and said,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.200]   you're impacted, changing priorities,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.720]   restructuring, blah, blah, blah.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.320]   And this is your last day.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   And I was sort of expecting it, but not expecting it.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.200]   I was blindsided, but also it was the manner
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.160]   in which it was done.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.000]   Like she didn't even want to get on the video call.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.240]   And then I sort of started asking questions
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.280]   'cause I was a little upset.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.120]   I said, well, why?
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.520]   I don't understand.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.720]   And we just said, I thought I was performing
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.240]   at a good level and meeting my goals, et cetera.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.560]   And then she just hung up.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.960]   She just hung up on the phone and I was sitting there
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.200]   looking at the HR person and the HR person was like,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   it was awkward, and then that ended.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.920]   And then I remember that day, the same company,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.720]   which was a staffing agency sent out a mass email
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.360]   to all the freelancers that worked there saying,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.680]   we're there for you.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   We got your back.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.120]   You're gonna get through the, and I was,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.160]   it was very ironic, but also very hurtful.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.120]   And that was one of the times I sent a bit
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.840]   of a nasty gram email to her manager.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   And I probably, it wasn't such the greatest move.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.520]   And later on, I reached out to the manager,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.560]   manager's manager and sort of cleared things up
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.000]   and she was understanding, thankfully.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.520]   So that was a real low point.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.320]   I went from, let's say, doing quite well
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.000]   to barely scraping by in terms of the amount of income
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.160]   I was bringing in.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.360]   So between May and September, I lost like,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.840]   you know, many, many, I lost a lot of business
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.760]   and I just, it took a while.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.720]   And oddly enough, the thing that brought me
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   sort of out of the tailspin was I got a job
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.040]   as a contractor at Facebook, which I hated.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I ended up quitting after like six months
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080]   'cause I really didn't enjoy the position
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.120]   or the group I was working with.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.800]   But at that point, I had started picking up more work
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.000]   and sort of got back to the level I needed
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.960]   in terms of income.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.600]   And so some of these things, I think,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.680]   dealing with low points are out of, you know,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.240]   the pandemic was certainly not in any of our control
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.080]   and it affected millions and millions of people.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.760]   And, you know, losing a job compared to some of the things
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.040]   that happened and all the people that lost their life
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.800]   sort of puts it in perspective.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.360]   Those low points I've had, whether it's been
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.320]   because of, you know, the stress of a child
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   or a pandemic or the other situation I described
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.880]   where I was sort of made a stupid mistake
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.000]   and got pushed out of an agency lead role
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.680]   were both open doors, but also like,
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.560]   I think you, Troy, you got at it.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   It's, you learn what you really want
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.640]   and you learn a bit about where you wanna be
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.080]   and what kind of organization you wanna be in.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.520]   And I think most importantly,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.000]   it's not just what the organization is selling.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.080]   It's about the people you're working with, the culture,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.680]   you know, the teams, how teams are motivated
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.760]   to get their work done and, you know,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.960]   what incentives they use.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.240]   And a lot of it is intangible.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.720]   It's trust, it's support, emotional support
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.680]   in a lot of ways, you know, it's setting realistic goals
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.480]   like Tammy was sharing about your experience managing
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.720]   the search engine person.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.400]   And I think these low points hopefully
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.640]   make us a little more knowledgeable
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.720]   as we move through our careers and, you know,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.920]   we keep going.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.400]   I mean, really, what other choice do we have?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   I think I'm thankful for the low points
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.680]   because they helped me appreciate the better points.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.120]   And I think that's a bit of, you know,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.440]   just growing a little bit more mature
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.640]   is being able to take, you know, the good and the bad
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.560]   and really stay in the space where you know who you are.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.400]   I know who I am.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.040]   I know what my strengths are.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   I know my weaknesses are.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.080]   And hopefully I'm aware of them most of the time.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.760]   And, you know, I can get a harsh critique
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.000]   or over, you know, hyperbolic praise,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.640]   but, you know, in either case,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.440]   I still know who I am
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.960]   and I know what value I bring to the work.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.280]   And I think that's an important part,
