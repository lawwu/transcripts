[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980]   What's the explanations for why there aren't more illicit uses of GPT?
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.380]   Why aren't more foreign governments using it to spread propaganda
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.820]   or scam grandmothers or something?
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.420]   Maybe they haven't really gotten to do it a lot, but it also wouldn't surprise
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.860]   me if some of it was going on right now.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.100]   Certainly I imagine they'd be taking some of the open source models and
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.940]   try and use them for that purpose.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.420]   Like I sure I would expect this would be something that'd
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.360]   be interested in the future.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.860]   It's like technically possible.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.020]   They just haven't thought about it enough.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.380]   Or haven't done it at scale using their technology, or maybe it's
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.420]   happening, but you just don't know it.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.100]   Would you be able to track it if it was happening?
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.140]   I think large scale tracking is possible.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.780]   Yes, it requires all special operations.
