[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   One of the remarkable balances C.S. Lewis makes in his theology seems to be his
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.180]   focus on quiddity, the "this-ness" of created reality, but without losing the
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.360]   eager anticipation of heaven or the new creation, things unseen. Pastor John, how
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.680]   does C.S. Lewis strike this balance? He does do it well, and probably the best
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.960]   thing we could do is to just read him and watch him do it, instead of trying to
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.520]   formulate how he did it. But I do think that Lewis does it well in large measure
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:55.040]   because in God's providence, Lewis came to faith by discovering the inadequacy
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.680]   of the lilies of the field, the inadequacies of the experience of
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.600]   northerness when he read his Norse mythology, because what he discovered was
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:19.760]   that his pangs of joyful longing as he saw beauty evaporated as soon as he
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.000]   turned to look at them. And he was endlessly frustrated that he would never
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.880]   really be able to have what he thought he wanted, namely these stabs of joy. They
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.720]   came, they went, and then Lewis discovered God, and then he discovered Christ, and
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.360]   then he discovered the gospel, and then he discovered the creator of all things,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.600]   and the goal of all things, and he realized that all of those things that
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.840]   had been trying to awaken him and he was trying to fasten on as the end in
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.600]   themselves were all pointers. The affection of joy was a pointer, and the
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   things that were awakening it, those mythologies that he was reading, they
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.680]   were all pointing towards the true myth, as he called it, namely
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   Christianity. So probably Lewis is a good guide for us in cherishing the eternal,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.760]   cherishing the unseen, cherishing God as the source and goal of all things, as
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.200]   well as being able to see the thisness and the beauty of this world, because
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.880]   God had brought him to faith through an appreciation of the thisness of things,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.600]   and then showed him that they were all thick with God. They were all pointing
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.000]   toward God, they were all created by God, and they were not ends in themselves.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.560]   They were ways of knowing God, and unless you saw deep enough into them to get to
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.040]   the bottom of them and saw high enough over them to get to what they're
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   pointing to, they will always disappoint you. Thank you, Pastor John. We will be
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.680]   studying the enduring influence of C.S. Lewis later this fall on September 27, 28,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   and 29 here in Minneapolis at the Desiring God National Conference. The
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.760]   conference is titled "The Romantic Rationalist--God, Life, and the Imagination
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.200]   in the Work of C.S. Lewis." More details and registration will be available very
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.400]   soon at DesiringGod.org, on the blog, and under the "Events" tab. I'm your host
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.680]   Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
