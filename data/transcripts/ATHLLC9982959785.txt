[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.680]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks show about upgrading your
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.040]   life, money, travel, all while spending less, saving more.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited to have you here.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Okay.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.680]   So today's conversation is going to be really fantastic because I'm talking
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.680]   with Carrie Walsh Jennings, who is widely regarded as the greatest female beach
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.000]   volleyball player of all time.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   She holds the beach volleyball record for most Olympic medals, three gold and a
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.200]   bronze, most career victories, and has the highest earnings of any female player.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.560]   She's been a pro for over 20 years.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   She's won three world championships.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.240]   She's played in over 250 tournaments in 30 countries.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.520]   And while she's still competing, she and her husband, Casey, also a pro volleyball
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.720]   player started P1440 in 2018, which is a digital platform exclusively built around
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.360]   the sport and culture of beach volleyball.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440]   Honestly, I'm a bit intimidated here, but I'm also really excited.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.600]   I know it'll be a great conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.640]   Carrie, thank you for being here.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   You nailed that intro.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.040]   High fives to you, Chris.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.400]   That's a good, that's a really good start.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200]   And obviously there's no need to be intimidated.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   I think in person, that might make more sense because I'm so big, but not, not
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.520]   by a zoo.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   Well, when we met, I think it was about 2018 as well.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.520]   We were at a conference.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.160]   I believe you were drinking some type of mushroom tea.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.040]   Does that sound right?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.640]   Probably.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   Probably stigmatic lion's mane or something to get my brain going.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   I would say most people would find that an unusual beverage choice.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.880]   What do you hang out with?
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   That's all my, that's all my friends drink.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.160]   And is that, would you put yourself in the category of people who like to experiment
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.800]   with interesting things that might improve your mind and your health?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.240]   Oh yeah.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.880]   Chris, I, a similar to you, like I am on this, this mission for self optimization,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.640]   self mastery.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   Like I want to feel so good in my days and I'm very sensitive when I'm not feeling
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   good as an athlete.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.640]   We're so trained to suck it up and carry on and go through walls and my shoulder's
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.040]   falling off, but I'm going to keep playing.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.120]   But as a human, a, that's just not sustainable.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.880]   I think it's admirable to a certain extent, but I think it's kind of dumb too.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.520]   But as a human, I just, I want to live a long life and I want to feel good in my
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.800]   life.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   And so when it comes time to wellness and nutrition and, and these things that I
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   can lean on to better optimize my system and therefore my energy and therefore my
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.040]   mood and therefore our relationships, I'm, I'm like all in.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   And so, yeah, I follow a lot of people on social media.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.240]   I listened to a lot of podcasts and everything I kind of digest is to help me
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   improve my life.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.520]   Wow.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   Okay.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   So I definitely want to make sure we spend some time in this conversation about some
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.040]   of those things, but I want to go back to some of the early days first.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.800]   So I know you grew up in a family of sports, your dad played baseball,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   basketball, your mom played volleyball.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.000]   Do you think you ever expected to be the pro athlete you became?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.320]   I expected to be a pro athlete, like 100%.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.920]   My first big dream was to be the first female pitcher in the major leagues that
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.520]   didn't work out.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.600]   You know, I played, I played baseball with my brother and my dad as a coach until I
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.280]   was 14.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.760]   I love baseball so much.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.280]   And then my second dream was to be the first female player in the NBA didn't work
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.560]   out, but I love basketball.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   I played throughout high school.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.640]   And then when I found volleyball, I just knew I wanted to play it as long as I
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.920]   could.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.120]   And so I think growing up in the family that I did, I knew I wanted to compete.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.600]   I knew I wanted to be physical and I had no idea it would be beach volleyball.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   Certainly.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120]   David Epstein wrote this book range recently about how generalists are
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.880]   successful.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.440]   And he compared Federer and Tiger Woods and Tiger Woods was all golf all the time.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.680]   And Federer's parent, mom, I think was a, was a tennis player.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.360]   And she was like, no, you got to play other sports.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.280]   Do you think that generalist approach you had as a, as a kid playing different
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.760]   sports helped with volleyball?
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.360]   Yes.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   Range is like one of the most valuable things you can have because then you just
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.680]   add more, more tools to your toolkit.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.400]   When you're challenging yourself in different sports, it's not just your body
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.200]   that's being challenged.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.120]   It's your nervous system.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   It's your thinking.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.760]   It's your problem solving.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.160]   It's the way to navigate what's in front of you.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.600]   And yes, absolutely.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.120]   And I talked to so many parents and athletes today, Chris, who are like their
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.960]   kids are being almost forced to make a decision when they're 10 years old.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.200]   What sport do you want to do forever?
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.680]   And what position in the sport?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   So it's Tiger Woods is the unicorn of all unicorns.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.720]   He started when he was three.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   I love that book, by the way, it's an amazing book.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.880]   Tiger, he's the anomaly.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.320]   And I think for the broader range, big picture scope of life, developing range
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.520]   by playing multiple sports, by playing in a band, by being in Bay club, whatever
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.800]   it is, developing range, because you try new and different things is just
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.360]   essential.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320]   And for me, I think that's one of the big reasons why I'm still going because I
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.120]   train that way.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.040]   I'm not just I'm not a linear person.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.920]   I'm always curious.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.200]   My trainers are very curious and they're very leading edge, but very traditional
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.920]   as well.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.080]   And so I'm always being challenged in different ways.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.800]   And my competency and capabilities just keep expanding.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   If I think back to your childhood and mine being different, so many parents,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   non-athletes, they're grinding and hustling every day at work.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.080]   But I think it's unusual for them to bring that home and their kids don't
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   actually see that hustle, that ambition, because it stays at the office.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.280]   And with your parents being athletes, there was no way to hide it.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.680]   Did that have a huge impact on you?
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.080]   And and does that have an impact on your kids?
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.040]   I love that you you you mentioned that because I swear to God, like one of the
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.320]   best gifts my parents have ever given me outside of their committed, loving
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.920]   relationship for over 40 years and being very present in my life is the fact that
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.440]   I got to witness them competing with all of their hearts and all of their joys
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.480]   and all of their misery.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.520]   Like my brother and I and I have two little sisters.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   We just we were with them competing all the time, running around the softball
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   fields and the bowling leagues and volleyball games and basketball.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.720]   Like my parents are intense competitors and the whole family would compete
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.120]   together.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560]   They played on the softball team called Family Feud and my mom's one of eight.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.360]   So it was all the siblings and then all of the in-laws.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.880]   And it wasn't they never lost.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.480]   And there would be fistfights.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.800]   There would be, you know, shit talking.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.560]   There would be like everything that's the best and the worst in sports happened.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.000]   And I got to witness it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.280]   And then we talk about it.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.440]   I'd hear my parents debriefing on the game.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   And we go to pizza after they get pizza and beers.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.080]   And I'd be listening to the stories they told.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   And it just it got wired.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.520]   It's in my DNA already, but it got wired in my consciousness.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.680]   Like competition is so fun when it's just even when it's hard.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.320]   It's so fun.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.720]   So to me, that's one of the best gifts they ever gave me.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.600]   Absolutely.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.680]   Do you think there's a way that someone who's not a pro athlete who has a traditional nine
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.960]   to five office job can bring that home to their family as well?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   Because I know so many people who are so ambitious and competitive in work,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.840]   but I don't think their kids ever see that.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.320]   Yeah, I think I don't I don't know because I haven't lived that life yet.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.720]   You know, the nine to five into more traditional job.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.440]   If I'm fired up about something, whether it's a Zoom call or work I'm doing for 1440,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.320]   even though it's not competition, if I'm fired up, I bring that home.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   And I talk to my kids about if I have a hard day, I talk to him about if I have a problem,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.200]   I talk to him about it.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.760]   And because part of my process is speaking things out loud.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.120]   You know, and my kids are geniuses.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.040]   So I lean on their wisdom and my husband as well.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.360]   And so I think one of the beautiful things we do in our family is that we share a lot.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.720]   We're really emotional humans.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.400]   So there's ups and downs and everything that we do and our kids are involved.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.080]   So if I have a great day at 1440, we had a new hire and we're kicking butt.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.400]   We just pivoted out of this tough situation.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.600]   They get fired up for me.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.400]   So I share it.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.280]   I think it's really important not only to celebrate the little wins,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.720]   even if it might seem part of the mundane part of your life.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.920]   I just think it's important because you're choosing to spend time doing it.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.640]   And so I think if you can bring enthusiasm and bring that to your family, that's valuable.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.120]   It's a win.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.840]   A win is a win.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.000]   It doesn't matter what uniform you're wearing or not.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.080]   Yeah, my daughter's only 16 months.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.640]   But I talked to Sunil Gupta, who wrote this book, Backable.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.200]   And he said, before you do a pitch at work, practice.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   And he's like, practice in front of your kids.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.640]   And I feel like there's this big, ultimate kind of hack for your children,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.160]   which is just show them the ambition and the hustle that you have,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.280]   even if it's at the office.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   There's so many people that say leave work at home.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.760]   You can leave some of work at home, but bring home part of it and show your kids
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.120]   how passionate you are about things or if they're side projects as well.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.320]   Totally.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.520]   I think that's so important.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.680]   A, I think it's just important to engage.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.080]   And your work life is a huge part of your life.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.000]   And so not that you want to bring everything home.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   But yeah, I think it's important to share what's going on in your office with your family,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.680]   because it's going to give them a better picture of who you are, what you're going through.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.560]   And that brings compassion and a kick in the butt if needed and a high five if needed.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.760]   So it's all good stuff.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.200]   Younger generations today.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.280]   So if I was a young person or a young woman wanting to play beach volleyball,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.880]   they have you to look up to, right?
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.400]   You created this career, massive career.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.360]   But I don't think, my record in the 90s,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.680]   beach volleyball was not a lucrative career.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.440]   Financially, by any means.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.680]   How did you push through that and forge a path with no one like yourself to look up to?
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.200]   Well, you know, I fancy myself an athlete.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.120]   You know, I mean, I know I'm a woman.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.960]   I know that I have that label.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.240]   But I just, there were definitely pioneers before me is what I'm trying to say.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.560]   You know, if you know beach volleyball or volleyball, you know,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.000]   Karch Karai, three-time gold medalist, Mike Dodd, Mike Whitmarsh.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.200]   Like there were pioneers before me that made a great living,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.440]   that were Olympians, that did amazingly internationally and domestically,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.640]   and had this beautiful career.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.080]   So even though they weren't women doing this, I had those role models.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   And that's a big gift.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.200]   And then when I came out to the beach in 2001,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.640]   after I left Stanford in my first Olympics and paired up with Misty,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.160]   it was just like lightning in a bottle.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.560]   Like the perfect storm with regard to timing,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.520]   partnership, kind of the shift in culture where
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   female athletes were being a little bit more celebrated and honored.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.320]   And Misty and I dominated.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.840]   And so I feel like just the fact that I always just wanted to be
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.560]   an athlete for athletes' sake, not labeled anyway,
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.400]   I think I just see inspiration in everything.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.600]   And that's how I'm wired anyway.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.280]   So if a boy is doing it just because I'm a girl,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.480]   I'm not thinking I can't do that.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.600]   Something that was a little bit harder was when I wanted to have kids.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.200]   And not a lot of professional female athletes did that while they're still competing.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   And so that was something a little bit different, but my mom showed me.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.320]   You know, my mom had eight kids.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.240]   She carried triplets for her sister.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.800]   She was playing softball, like diving,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.360]   sliding in the third base while she was pregnant, having a kick-ass job,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.680]   selling real estate, being very present with my father,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.000]   and making it and having four kids of her own.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   You know, so I saw that in action.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.080]   And I've just, I've been so blessed to have these authentic role models,
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   people who lead themselves first, who follow their passions,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.360]   and they align their passions with their personal lives,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.280]   with their families and their relationships.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.520]   So it's been, I've been very blessed in that way.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.720]   Yeah, I've heard a lot of people talk about kind of the finances of beach volleyball, right?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.800]   Professional beach volleyball players are not making what pro NFL players
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.960]   and basketball players are making.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.920]   How did that factor in early on?
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.280]   I imagine, I heard you say once you were on the indoor national team
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.360]   and you're making like $1,000 a month.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.520]   Did you need side hustles?
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.440]   Like, how do you make the bills?
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.480]   How do the bills get paid?
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.360]   How do you make ends meet?
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.040]   How do you pay for trainers in a career where it's not as lucrative as other sports?
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.800]   It's, this is such a long conversation.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.480]   You know, when I was playing indoor volleyball on the indoor team,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.160]   making $1,000 a month, I got a raise to $1,200 and I was stoked.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.840]   But when you're on the indoor team, they pay for housing, they pay for travel,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   your coaches are paid for.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.560]   So that's all in one little kit.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.880]   So I was broke, but I didn't have anywhere to spend money.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.560]   And I lived in Colorado Springs,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.800]   where like a fun Friday night was going to Walmart and like walking the aisles.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   So I didn't, and I just wanted to win.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.280]   You know, I was just focused on training and my life was very simple,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.080]   not to disrespect Walmart or Colorado Springs, because I loved it.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.280]   But beach volleyball, it's, you pay to work, basically.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.720]   We train Monday through Friday, you play on the weekends,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.120]   you pay Monday through Friday for your coaches,
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.920]   for your strength coach, for your nutritionist, whatever you have.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.080]   And then on the weekends, you're hoping to recoup that money by your prize money.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.640]   And I can name probably maybe 10 athletes around the world
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.680]   that can only do beach volleyball and have it be their living.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.240]   And it's not because of prize money, it's because of endorsement deals.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.400]   But the endorsement deals on the same time
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.080]   compared to other sports are just pennies to the dollar on the dollar.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.000]   And that's something with through 1440, my company, and just through my life,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.880]   like I really want to elevate the marketplace for volleyball in general,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.000]   not just beach, but indoor as well, because the sport is so wonderful.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.200]   The lifestyle is incredible.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.000]   It's so sexy.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.880]   It's family.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.600]   It's dynamic.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.160]   It's finesse.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.720]   It's everything.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.360]   But for some reason, the marketplace hasn't really
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.760]   aligned to us where the number one Olympic sport,
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.000]   indoor and beach combined every four years, it gets the highest ratings.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.920]   So once every four years, we are the best thing in the world and then we go away.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.560]   But for me, I think winning led to more opportunities.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.240]   I have a lot of side hustles.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.360]   I am an athlete.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.800]   I do speaking engagements.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.240]   I have my endorsements.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.480]   So photo shoots, all these different obligations,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.360]   media obligations that I have that bring in the money.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.480]   And for me, as I go, I just want to keep opening more doors to revenue in my life.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.600]   I don't want just one.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.200]   Not that that's wrong, but I just I want more diversity in my life.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.800]   I can't do anything every day.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.920]   I'd fade away.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.560]   So I like diversity in my life and my money making opportunities.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.880]   And so that's what I'm encouraging and inviting in my life is more revenue streams coming in.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.440]   It's a theme I see now is lots of people wanting lots of different side hustles.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.760]   Were there any side hustles early on when you
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   didn't have your endorsement deals that were fun and good to share?
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.120]   I had two jobs early on.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.200]   And then at some point, my endorsement deals picked up.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.760]   But I was a dog walker for about maybe maybe three months, maybe six.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.120]   But it was so stressful.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.840]   The woman I took over for, she got hurt on the job.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.280]   She was walking two of that.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   One of the dogs that were the like the Swiss Alps.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.680]   They're huge dogs.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.720]   Bernese Mountain dogs.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.680]   Yes, I think so.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.800]   So two ginormous ones.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.120]   Right.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.800]   And she's walking them and a cross crosses a cat crosses the alley.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.160]   They take off and drag her.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.000]   And she tore both ACLs.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.320]   And I was like, I'm an athlete.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.600]   This is what I'm walking into.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.640]   What am I doing?
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.480]   So that was one job, but it paid well.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   People pay a lot of money for their pets.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.880]   And then I worked in a kid's shoe store.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   And it wasn't necessarily for the money, even though I needed money because I live very simply.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.120]   But it was just I needed something to do.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.840]   And I need to contribute in my life and be with people.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.000]   So those are the two solutions I had.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.240]   And then obviously, camps and clinics and coaching.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.840]   I've done a fair amount of that.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.000]   But I'm glad those days are over, really.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.840]   Yeah, I love how resourceful you were.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.200]   And I also love that dog walking is stressful when you're also
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.600]   an Olympian who's played on the world stage.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.040]   Well, I only had, I think, two Olympics under my belt at that point.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.240]   So I was a rookie.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   But no, you know, it's like, my God, these uncontrollable animals.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   I do have a fun Olympics question.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.080]   So you worked hard, right?
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.760]   Three gold medals, but it was across three Olympics, four years apart.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.360]   I have to ask, in 2008, Michael Phelps did the same thing.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.640]   Three gold medals in a little over 24 hours.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   And I know it took you three Olympics.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.520]   And I know you're so supportive of Team USA.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.880]   But it has to be a little frustrating when someone can get three golds in,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.160]   like, almost a day, and it takes you three Olympics.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.520]   It just is what it is.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.440]   You know, I don't want to be a swimmer.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.000]   If I had a big enough issue with that, I'd be a swimmer.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.080]   And I'd try to go beat Michael Phelps's records.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   But no, you know, that's it's just that's why the different sports,
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.560]   you respect them for different reasons.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.680]   But I think the longevity in our sport is gnarly.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.560]   And if you can be a high performer and have sustained excellence
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.320]   and keep winning over a decade, like that's pretty unusual.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.400]   Michael's done his next level unusual,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.320]   but he has different opportunities than I have.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.120]   I would never get mad at Michael for, you know,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.840]   having 19 or more gold medals and everything he's done.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.800]   That man's incredible.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.480]   I would love to sit and talk to him about that,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.200]   because that's just a whole different whole different ballgame.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.400]   We need to start a podcast.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.600]   I yeah, I have some thoughts, but I don't know.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.160]   You got to keep you got to like you do so well.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.640]   Like what did you say you're in the top what percent of podcasts?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.320]   Yeah, I mean, the show's been doing great.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.920]   We're in the top half a percent.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.080]   Guys, I don't even know what that means.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.800]   That's a gold medal.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.600]   So that's incredible.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.240]   But you because you don't have acid and I just need to, you know,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.400]   all these things require preparation and commitment.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.320]   And if I do it, I'll be inspired by you
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.120]   and I want to break that top three or top percent.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.240]   But yeah, maybe down the road.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.840]   You mentioned gold medals.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   I got to ask, where do you keep the gold medals?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.040]   Are they are they in a safe?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.160]   You just keep them on the wall?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.680]   No, they're in a little cute bag in my closet.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.880]   Just waiting to be brought to an appearance
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.720]   or shown to kids or something.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.040]   I gave one to my I gave my first one to my parents.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.640]   OK, the one from Athens.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.080]   And my dad gave it back to yours.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.120]   No, it was really yours.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.160]   You guys earned it.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   And he's no, it's just sitting in our safe.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.440]   And you'll you'll put it to better use.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   So, yeah, the collection is together.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.240]   But I feel like it's I feel like it's a little bit short.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.760]   I really do want one more.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   But I'm just trying to figure out the retirement game or not.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.280]   Yeah, one more.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   There's an opportunity coming, right?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.680]   There is.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.120]   Yeah, I gave myself until June to figure out if I'm retired or not.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.080]   I just needed some space because I don't have 100 percent clarity.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.600]   And I don't know if you feel the same.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.840]   But like, I'm at this point in my life where I can't.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.240]   Like, I need something to be at 100 percent F yes or it's a no, you know,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.520]   especially with something that requires so much of your heart and soul and
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.080]   sacrifice and leaving family like I need this to be 100 percent plus.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.480]   Yes.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160]   And I'm just a little bit on the fence.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.880]   And so I gave myself tell June to figure it out.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.240]   But my heart wants it, Chris.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.280]   And I don't know if that's just the athlete in me that's never going to die
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.400]   or if this dream is just I just believe.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.920]   And I still I'm still hungry.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   I'm still physical.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.920]   I still feel great.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's a life side of my life that would get in the way and not get in the way.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.840]   But that would make me choose retirement.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.400]   So we'll see.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   Is it more about pushing for another gold or is it more about ending on a gold?
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.320]   And yeah, that's a great question.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   I really do believe in fairytale endings and I want it.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.160]   Like so I can just say that.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.000]   But I just feel and I don't want to end on a bad note like this past quad.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.400]   Like I lost myself so much last year and I just literally forgot how to play volleyball.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.240]   Like emotionally, I couldn't handle it.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.960]   And it was it was so many things I don't want to get into.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.080]   But, you know, it just interfered with what I do best.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:38.880]   And that's a bummer.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   And so there's part of that that I want to rectify.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.120]   But more than that, I love it.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   And I believe that there's more and better in me.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.920]   And I have this dream of a partner who I want to play with,
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.760]   who we're going to get together after the holidays and see if there's any magic there.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.440]   And if if if we can commit to this, it's 100 percent.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.040]   Yes, I just got to go through the paces.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.480]   It's a process to figure these things out.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.680]   Apparently, my whole life, everything is just unfolded and everything's made sense.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.880]   And it just keeps happening.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.040]   And this is the first time in my life where I'm like, let me pause.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.440]   Let me think what I think I'm in trouble.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   So I'm just like praying and just waiting to know, you know, I'm waiting to I'm excited.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.800]   See you in Paris.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.320]   So one of those times where you had everything fall together perfectly
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   from August 20, 2007 to August 2008, you and Misty went on 112 match winning streak.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.400]   And most people in a year have some good weeks, some bad weeks.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.000]   I can't imagine that a whole year was just a whole year of good days.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.600]   Every single day, nothing was hard.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.480]   But you guys won every time.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.840]   What do you do?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.200]   Maybe you didn't have a bad day, but I'm going to assume you did.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   How do you get past that?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.520]   And how do you still perform at that level when you're having
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.920]   a bad day, which I think for everyone is inevitable?
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:53.520]   Yeah, I mean, certainly there are a lot of near misses, near losses in that run.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.560]   The world's very good.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.160]   And we had to play a lot of great teams.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.280]   Certainly, there was a lot of injuries to play through and friction in our
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   team to work through and friction in life.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.480]   It's Misty and I were literally magic.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.760]   So it's like something would happen on the court.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.600]   And either we'd start the match on point and we finish on match and just crush someone.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.960]   Or we would just start wonky and people would challenge us.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   And then at some point, we'd always just come together.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.960]   It's like the harder things got for Misty and I, the more uncomfortable it was.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.040]   We just got closer together.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.880]   And that is a legacy of, you know, that builds legacies.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   We think about the Patriots or the Warriors or the Giants or whoever's had amazing,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.880]   successful, longstanding legacies.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   I think that it's that ability to come together when times are tough
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.520]   because you have that belief, you have that respect, you have that
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.200]   vulnerability and strength together.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   And Misty and I had that for 10 years, basically.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.960]   But that run in 2007-2008 was really gnarly.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.880]   And for me, that was the time of my career where I was most obsessed.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.240]   Like 100% volleyball all the time.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.480]   And I had gotten married in 2005.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.200]   I almost lost my marriage because of my obsession.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.280]   Like, all I wanted to do is win, you know.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.560]   Right after I got married, after the Athens Games, I got pregnant and had a miscarriage.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.480]   And then my husband and I decided to wait till after Beijing to try again.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   And so, in that period of two, two and a half years,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.360]   I was like, "If I'm not having babies, I need to win."
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.480]   And so, I lost sight of my life and just got so focused on volleyball.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.560]   And we dominated.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   Misty and I were so close.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.280]   Like, and our coach was so close.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.480]   We were so rad.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   We were so connected, which is beautiful, which is how you win.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.720]   But my life fell apart.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.160]   So, even though we kicked ass and dominated and that was part of the record books,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.440]   I would never want to go back there because everything that's most important to me
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.080]   almost was just blown away and destroyed.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.600]   To have a year like that?
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.440]   - I don't think it has to be that.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.320]   And that's part of why I want to keep going.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.240]   It's like, "God, I really, I can do this better."
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.800]   Because like I told you, moving forward to Paris,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.560]   like, I need to marry the intimate connection with my family
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.680]   with the intimate connection I have with my partner and the journey.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.960]   Because right now, I haven't done that.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.320]   And it's like, I have to peace out to my family for six weeks at a time.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   And my heart can't take that anymore.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:04.960]   It can't.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.280]   Like, literally, I might die if it feels like that.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.320]   Because I can't breathe.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.040]   I can't focus.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.000]   I feel so guilty.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.200]   All these things.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.720]   And I miss my family so much.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.160]   And my kids are suffering for it.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.960]   And my husband.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.880]   So I really don't believe, I believe it requires obsession.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.360]   But I believe there's a way to have a healthy obsession
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   and to make sure that you're living life and being present wherever you are.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.160]   For me, it's if I had a tournament in two weeks, but I was home,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.480]   I could only think about the tournament in two weeks.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.080]   So it's like my time at home was wasted.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.680]   - Yeah.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.920]   What do you think, if you could go back to 2007,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.960]   what do you think you could share to your younger self
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.000]   that would allow you to find that balance?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.360]   - Well, I think it's just like, one of my favorite quotes
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.280]   is from my performance psychologist, Mike Gervais.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.640]   And he says, "Be where your feet are."
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.920]   Like, be 100% where you are.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.560]   Because if you're on the court, then if you're in the moment
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.400]   and you're not worried about the past or the future,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.960]   all of your tools and resource and focus and greatness
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.840]   is going to show up in that moment if you're where your feet are.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.800]   Same thing in life.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   If I'm with my husband, but I have a huge tournament,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.960]   you know, coming up or a big game the next day.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.120]   But if I'm with him in that moment for that hour,
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.200]   that hour is going to feel like four days
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.320]   because I'm in the moment
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   and I'm connecting with him sincerely.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.640]   So I think the antidote to so much stress
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.960]   and to balancing your obsessions with your life obsessions
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.320]   is just to be in the moment.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.440]   And certainly we've all heard the kind of quote
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.640]   that what grows is what you nurture in water.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.000]   And so it's like, I went to this Tony Robbins.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.520]   Do you know Tony Robbins?
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.160]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.240]   - Yeah, so I went to one of his seminars
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.360]   and it was so amazing.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.640]   And one of the first thing he says,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.840]   people have been jumping up and down
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.360]   for an hour straight waiting for him.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.720]   And one of the first thing he says is,
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.560]   you guys, I know you guys all kick ass
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.440]   and you bring energy and love and passion to your jobs.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.240]   And everyone's like, yeah.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.720]   And he goes on a riff on that for a second.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.000]   And then he goes, but take a moment.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.560]   Think about the energy and the passion
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.480]   and the presence you bring to your relationships.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.800]   And everyone was like, oh, like it was so deflating.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   And to me, it was like such a slap in my face
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.880]   because my husband tells me that all the time.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.240]   Less now because I'm working on it.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.120]   He's like, babe, you give everyone outside of this house,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   the world, your energy, your focus.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.320]   Like you make them feel like
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.440]   they're the only thing in the world.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.200]   Then you come home, you're exhausted.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.120]   And your time with us is not as quality.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.160]   So can we fix that?
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.840]   And then when Tony said that, I was like,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.720]   oh my hell, yes, it's so true.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   And so I feel like if I can give the energy and the love,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   it's a different expression of it.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.560]   But to give the energy and love that I put to my career
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.440]   toward my family and whatever expression is real,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   that's the game changer.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.240]   And do it consistently.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.760]   Like you can't just do it once in a while.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.840]   I can't appreciate my husband once in a while
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.360]   or be there for my kids once in a while.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.840]   Like I want to go metal as a mom too and a wife too.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.440]   So that requires every day.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.360]   - Yeah, are there any kind of tricks
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.720]   or things you've added to your routine
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.040]   to make that work better?
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.840]   - Man, I, well, I was always involved, you know,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.080]   but I was just kind of distracted, kind of agitated.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.520]   Like I was all there, but I was just like,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.800]   it was kind of like a caged lion.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   Like, fuck, let me, let me at it.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   And that's almost embarrassing to say,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.520]   but it's my, it's my truth.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.240]   But for me, you know, mindfulness practice
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.280]   is a huge part of my life.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.040]   When I started meditating and taking time
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.320]   to be in stillness every day,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   it really allows me to respond to life
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.400]   and not just be so reactive.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.240]   And I am a very emotional person.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.000]   So I feed off uranogy.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.280]   If you're having a bad day,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.960]   I kind of make myself have a bad day
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.880]   and I just want to control my environment
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.080]   so everyone's comfortable.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.360]   And when I meditate,
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.800]   when I have that stillness within me,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.960]   I just, I'm more of an observer
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   and I can respond in more healthy ways.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.720]   So that's really beautiful to me.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.160]   And I just made it a priority.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   I've done a lot of self-help work.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.560]   I did a lot of work with my performance psychologist,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.120]   Mike Gervais.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   And he's like, basically, Carrie, he's like,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.400]   you, you can't have it all,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.280]   but you can have what matters most to you.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.520]   So figure out what matters most to you
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.040]   and then make those your priorities.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.200]   So for me, I figured out what was most important to me
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.080]   and I put them in buckets.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.480]   So I have my, I have my faith, right?
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.760]   My God, my creator.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.920]   I have to connect to that because that empowers me.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.440]   That makes me empowered in life.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.960]   I have my family, right?
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000]   I have my career.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   And those three things,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.360]   like those are my three things, my three buckets.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.120]   And so when I'm feeling out of sorts in the world,
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.560]   literally, if I take a moment and be like,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.000]   hey, out of my three buckets,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.520]   what am I not serving?
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.080]   It shows me what I'm not paying attention to.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.040]   And so my life side of my life has to be a priority.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   Otherwise everything else is going to be,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.800]   I'm going to get bronzes
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.960]   or I'm not even going to qualify.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   So, you know, things like that.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   - So much of performance is often not in the thing.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.800]   It's what's in your head.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.920]   It's what's going on outside.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.400]   But you mentioned you have a performance coach,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   mindfulness, those aren't physical things.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.960]   Do you think a lot of the success
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.440]   is more mental than physical in sports?
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.360]   - I heard someone say, and I really love this
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.800]   'cause it's like, what's more important,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.560]   the mental or the physical?
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.040]   And to me, like emotional is so important too.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.440]   But this guy said, Andrew Huberman,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.520]   Huberman Lab Podcast, he's incredible.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.680]   He said, get rid of all that.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.480]   Everything is your nervous system, right?
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.720]   So your mental capacity, your emotional, your physical,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.560]   it all is wrapped up in your nervous system.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.680]   And so I just think it's everything all wrapped into one.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.240]   For me, I think the easier part of everything
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.200]   is the physical part.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.800]   I'm an athlete, like I can suck it up.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.840]   I can go really hard.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.040]   I can do these things.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.840]   The harder part is pulling back if I'm injured,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   like recovering, prioritizing sleep and nutrition
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.720]   and going to my performance psychologist,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.080]   kind of the softer skills.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.120]   But to me, the softer skills make me lethal,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.080]   and they enhance my physical skills.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.680]   So I don't think there's an answer to that question
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.400]   other than the fact that everything impacts everything else.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.280]   And if we could all have healthy nervous systems
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.880]   because we pay attention and fuel our body, mind and spirit,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.480]   then we could all kick ass longer
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.760]   and feel better while we're doing it.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.800]   Like, I don't wanna grit out and grind out a journey
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.320]   that I hate and get to the end and be like,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.000]   oh, we won, but that sucked.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.520]   I never wanna do that.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.200]   I really do wanna enjoy my days.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   And so for me, it's about creating processes,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.480]   hanging out with people,
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.760]   making sure my environment allows for that joy,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.680]   that positive energy in my days,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.120]   because I know that serves me best.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.600]   - Yeah, I've not been fortunate to have a mental
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.440]   or performance psychologist.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.360]   What are some of the lessons you've learned
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.840]   from that relationship that people listening
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.320]   might be able to apply to their home work lives?
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.720]   - Well, outside of the mindfulness practice,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.080]   which it's like for me,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.600]   and Tony Robbins mentions this as well.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   He's like, whenever you're feeling so overwhelmed
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.240]   and so in your head or so just stuck in life,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   he's like, get out of your head and get into your body.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.480]   Right, so that was a big thing for me
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.720]   because I tend to, I wanna fix everything.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.840]   I wanna know the answer.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.760]   Like, I wanna be able to speak, articulate to everything.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.920]   And if I can't, then I get overwhelmed.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.760]   And then I just don't know what to do.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   And so go take a walk, go for a run, get in the sauna.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.920]   You need to do something to get back into your whole system.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.120]   And I think that's really helpful.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.920]   So for me, Mike Gervais gave me this practice,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.720]   like before I get in the car,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.680]   I turn the car on and I actually listen to the ignition.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.080]   Right, I feel the steering wheel in my hand.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.680]   So anything to like connect my body, all my senses,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.840]   that brings you back to the moment.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.960]   And again, if we're in the moment,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   then we can attack our lives beautifully, more powerfully
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.280]   than if we weren't in the moment,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.640]   rushing through and racing through.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.440]   Something else that really helped me with Mike Gervais
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.760]   is that he doesn't do the work for you,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.080]   but he kind of, he highlights the work you have.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.040]   And I, he helped me realize how much baggage I carry around
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.440]   and how I have just these ridiculous expectations.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.200]   And mostly actually is how important my self-talk
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.160]   is to my success and my satisfaction in life.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.480]   And what he says, which I know to be true at this point,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.320]   is that self-confidence comes from one place
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.360]   and one place only.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   And that's the way you talk to yourself.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.440]   And so Mike Gervais is a huge proponent of having positive
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.680]   in the very least neutral self-talk,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.440]   where instead of belittling yourself
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.960]   and saying, oh, you're idiot, oh, you F that up,
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   or we're going to lose.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.680]   It's like, that's going to give you momentum
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.120]   in the totally wrong direction.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.680]   So if you find yours, if you have the awareness
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.360]   to hear yourself talking to yourself like that,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.000]   you have the awareness, you catch yourself,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.280]   and then you choose better.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.400]   So choose a neutral thought.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.760]   'Cause it's hard to go from, oh, you're the worst
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.360]   in the world to you're the best.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.640]   That's not credible.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.320]   So go from, ah, that sucked.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.200]   You're terrible to let's restart.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.400]   Let's try this again.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.040]   I got this.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.920]   I'm ready for this.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.600]   This is part of it, to neutral talk.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.480]   And then from neutral, you can go into more positive talk.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.320]   So I think the inner critic is very valuable,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.120]   but the self-talk that you have really,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.200]   really determines your performance.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.880]   - I'm just thinking, imagine I finished an interview
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.680]   and it wasn't great.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.120]   Would it be fair to say, instead of saying,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.160]   God, that was horrible, to say, that wasn't my best?
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.760]   Is that neutral?
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.560]   Or help me nail down what neutral is.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.320]   - Well, yeah, I think it's like,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.720]   I don't think you lie to yourself, you know?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.920]   Well, yeah, no, I think that's fair.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.640]   I think that's fair.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.160]   And then you'd be like, hey, what could I do better?
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.200]   What did I do well?
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   You know, after every game, we have a debrief
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.760]   where it's like, what do we do good individually?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.360]   What can we work on individually?
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.560]   And then collectively.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.840]   So for something like that, it's did I prepare well enough?
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.880]   Was I rushing?
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.240]   How did I feel on my body?
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.440]   How could I have made the environment more amenable
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.800]   to having a great podcast?
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.520]   These types of things.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.560]   I think these thoughts are great.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.880]   But in the moment, I think it's really important
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.520]   to be neutral or positive or encouraging
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.240]   in the very least.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.000]   Encouragement is such a huge thing in life.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   And then after, yeah, you just don't beat yourself up.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.480]   You can acknowledge it and be like,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.520]   "Okay, I'll do better next time.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.480]   How can I do better?"
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.000]   And then you carry on, you know?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.840]   - Yeah, I mean, this must be easy.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.320]   I know your nickname, Six Feet of Sunshine,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.000]   you have this positive attitude and joy.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.080]   Is there a secret to all that happiness and success and joy
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.480]   that keeps you having all this positive self-talk
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   and not even self-talk, outward talk?
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.840]   - Well, my self-talk is way, is gnarly, you know?
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.720]   I have a lot of room for improvement, for sure.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.360]   I definitely speak outwardly more positively in general,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.240]   but I do, it's authentic to me to be positive.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.640]   Nature and nurture, my family's that way.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   I don't have any pessimists around me.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.880]   I don't have a lot of cynics around me.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.960]   I have a lot of curious people around me,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.680]   a lot of people who have a lot of faith around me.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.760]   And so I think, and I'm just a very faithful,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.200]   optimistic person by nature.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.400]   And then in my life experience, when I have been cynical,
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.720]   when I have indulged in like, woe is me and feeling terrible
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.400]   and being overburdened by a challenge,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.800]   thinking in a more negative way
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.200]   takes me so far from what I want.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.520]   So now it's, if I fail, I've revamped it in my head where,
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.480]   okay, that was a rep.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.880]   That rep shows me where I can improve
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.320]   and I'm determined to improve.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.240]   So now I go to work and that could be a mental rep,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.120]   it could be a physical rep,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.680]   but that's a positive way to frame these things.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.200]   It's a repetition of something.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.720]   And then I just get curious.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.040]   It's okay, so if I'm having this podcast
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.200]   and I want to kick ass and I almost want it too bad,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.400]   and I'm feeling so much anxiety
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.080]   that I can't even have this conversation,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.760]   I want to be curious about my anxiety.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.840]   What are my thoughts before the podcast?
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.040]   What are my thoughts during?
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   Just self-awareness to me is like a superpower.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.360]   And if we can develop self-awareness
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.040]   of how we feel in certain situations,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   how we feel around certain people,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.960]   our kind of our routines, all these things,
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.800]   like we have so much more control in our lives
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.600]   than I think we think.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.080]   And I think what I said earlier is that
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.680]   when you find yourself in a funk,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.000]   like if you find yourself thinking terrible thoughts,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.680]   that's self-awareness that you're having that.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.400]   But the real thing is sometimes we think
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.000]   our thoughts are thinking for us,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.920]   but that's just because that's a habit.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   Like we can stop that and flip the script
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.280]   and choose better.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.000]   And my philosophy is always just choose better.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.080]   You know, and if you focus on the solution,
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.280]   then the solution is going to come.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.240]   If you focus on the problem,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.840]   the problem is going to seem like,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.120]   and it's going to envelop you.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.960]   It's kind of law of attraction type stuff.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.920]   Focus on what you want, not what you don't want.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.520]   It seems like with every business,
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.880]   you get to a certain size
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.560]   Things that you used to do in a day
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.760]   are taking a week
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.080]   and you have too many manual processes
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.320]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.280]   If this is you,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   you should know these three numbers,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.560]   37,000, 25, one.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.880]   37,000, that's the number of businesses
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.200]   which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.840]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.360]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.440]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.080]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.920]   So I love having an easy way
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.160]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.040]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.880]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.160]   for this episode.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.440]   what all the hype was about,
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.080]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.960]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.320]   add a few ice cubes,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.240]   it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.320]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.680]   and energized for the day,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.400]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.840]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.360]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.080]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.

[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.240]   or artificial anything.

[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.720]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.440]   - You talked a lot about self-awareness.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.080]   Does that come mostly from your mindfulness practice,
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.720]   or where does some of that come from?
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.760]   - You know, I think I'm a pretty self-aware human.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.600]   I don't know if as an athlete, if you need to be,
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.120]   'cause you need all systems firing.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.560]   I come from a big family,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.120]   and I think that kind of knowing your place,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.960]   and we're all utility players,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.520]   having an awareness of what's needed at a certain time,
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.120]   I think that's part of my upbringing.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.760]   I definitely have trained it through mindfulness training.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.360]   I really love people.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.480]   I really love connecting,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   and I think I'm an empath to a certain extent,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.600]   so I feed off energy.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.200]   So I think it's just something that it's natural to me,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.040]   and to me, it just pays so many dividends,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.160]   not only in myself,
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.520]   because I can self-regulate
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   if I'm aware of something happening,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.320]   but within my relationships,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.640]   because I can notice how I'm feeling with my husband
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.080]   if we're having a tough conversation,
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.680]   or if my husband's having a tough day,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.000]   I can have awareness about how he's feeling,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.960]   and then I can address it,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.640]   or love him more, or whatever it is.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.720]   I think those things are very, very valuable.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.960]   The emotional IQ part of life, to me, is so undervalued.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.160]   For every top performer,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.680]   I think it's just a really important thing,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   especially if you want a long career.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.640]   So I think you gotta pay attention to that stuff.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.880]   - Yeah, are there things to improve it?
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.080]   Some of those things are natural, right?
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.840]   You can't go back in time and have a large family.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.720]   - No, right.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.840]   - But what are things you think people can do to improve it?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.200]   - I think just, again, I think just developing a practice.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.440]   Well, A, knowing who you are is really valuable,
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.160]   and being curious about becoming your best self.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.400]   I feel like if you're always curious
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.080]   about what the potential you have,
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   then that just makes you like, "Oh, okay, I just had that.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.640]   "I just did that, it was just an A-hole to that person.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.840]   "I wanna do that better."
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.200]   Kind of living what you don't want
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.800]   shows you what you do want type of thing,
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   and that's with self-awareness as well.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.000]   And so I'm always trying to be a better version of myself
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.800]   while loving myself at the same time, even through my flaws.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.360]   And so I feel like that kind of self-love component,
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.840]   the curiosity about your innate potential
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.880]   is really important.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.560]   And then I just think creating space in your life
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.080]   is really important where it's like,
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.480]   if you're having a challenging relationship
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.400]   or if there's a challenge in general,
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.440]   if you can pull yourself outside of it
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.200]   and become the observer of it,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   which is like Jedi stuff.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.800]   But so you're not like in the middle of it,
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   but you're like, "Okay, there's this argument going on
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.480]   "or I'm involved in this argument.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.240]   "Like what's behind this?"
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.360]   You know, and all these things.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.760]   Like I just, I feel like getting out of the mud.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.280]   Okay, a couple of things.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   So I think being curious is really important
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.360]   about yourself, about others.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.120]   Like what's behind this friction?
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.080]   I think that that's a thought that makes you not be like,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.720]   "What the fuck?
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.080]   "Like, why are you doing this?
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   "Okay, like really what's behind this?
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   "I'm really curious.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.800]   "I really care about these people or this situation."
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.040]   So get curious, create some space
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.800]   so that you can actually see what's going on
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.200]   instead of being super emotionally tied to what's going on.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.480]   And then focus on the solution.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.560]   I think these are all things that are based in awareness
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.600]   that will then allow you to have tools
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.960]   to respond appropriately.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.920]   'Cause there's not one right answer for every situation,
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   even if it's a similar situation all the time.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.440]   So I think giving yourself space,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.640]   giving yourself a moment, a breath to be in the moment,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.720]   like one breath, deep breath in and out,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.000]   resets your physiology.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.880]   Like something volleyball
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.400]   that probably relates to this a little bit
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.920]   is that I've been encouraged,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.200]   if I'm feeling like tunnel vision,
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.440]   'cause I'm stressed, I'm anxious, it's a big moment.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.760]   I've been encouraged to look off to the horizon
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.160]   because it literally expands my vision and my brain is,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.480]   "Oh, okay, I'm not in this little fight or flight mode.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.760]   "Like I have take on the full kaleidoscope of world,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.640]   "which is beautiful."
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.360]   And so I think just reprogramming yourself
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.760]   so you can be in the moment without anxiety,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.440]   just knowing that you're equipped
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.880]   to handle whatever's in your way
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.000]   or whatever you're dealing with
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.680]   is a beautiful mindset type of thing.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.520]   So that was all over the place,
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.840]   but it's just space is important.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.960]   Awareness is important.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.440]   And then responding mindfully is important.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.320]   And those things don't just happen like on game day.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.920]   Like I train every day like that.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   And I use my training in my personal life too.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.200]   Like in a conversation with my husband
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.520]   or if a phone call, I have to make him 1440,
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.560]   I have to go fire somebody.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.040]   Like I take my breath before.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.760]   I think I have my preparation,
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.840]   my intention for all these things.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.520]   I think of what I want the outcome to be.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.200]   And then I go.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.800]   So the preparation is everything.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.560]   And then it's all about being in the moment.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.880]   - I've done a lot of those things as well.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.680]   So that's really helpful.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.640]   - Yeah, does it work for you?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.320]   - Yeah, I mean, for me,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   there was an interesting conversation
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   I had about kind of distraction.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.680]   There's a guy named Nir Eyal
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.520]   who wrote a book called "Indistractable."
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.680]   And he says, "When you're at this moment
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.960]   "where you feel distracted,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.160]   "take a moment and like feel what that is
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.600]   "so you can recognize it."
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.640]   Because a lot of times
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.840]   the reactions you take to things aren't,
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.880]   you're not aware of them until you understand them.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.760]   And once you realize it,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.160]   like you said, pause in the car and hear things.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.360]   Once you're kind of in the moment,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.320]   you can course correct.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.840]   But if you don't pause to understand
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.880]   when that moment happens,
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.240]   it's really hard to course correct.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.520]   - Totally, yeah, yeah, I agree.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.800]   I honestly think being in the moment
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.160]   is the antidote to everything in life.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.320]   - Yeah, we talked a lot about things
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.520]   you can do in your mind,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.560]   but when it comes to the body,
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.600]   we started our conversation talking about mushroom tea.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.040]   And you mentioned you've got a lot of things
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.600]   that you've done and experimented with to optimize.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.080]   I'd love to hear the things that worked,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.120]   maybe the things that didn't,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.040]   but the things that have stayed in your routine
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.800]   to help you maybe in that realm.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.040]   - Yeah, there's so many things
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.440]   and they're all like so fundamental and nothing's new.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.240]   So obviously sleep is just a huge, huge priority.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.080]   That's for my mental performance,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.600]   my emotional capabilities,
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.560]   and my physical performance.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.360]   Sleep is everything.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.600]   And then nutrition is obviously huge.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.920]   And I don't have any specific diet,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.760]   but I definitely eat very clean.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.400]   I focus on protein a lot.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.440]   I eat a ton of protein.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.400]   I'm a meat eater.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.960]   And I just think my body and my brain needs protein,
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.000]   needs good fat as well.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.680]   So those are my two priorities in my nutrition.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.240]   I just literally, today's day one
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.640]   off of this eight day milk cleanse,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.040]   'cause this is so gross, but I have parasites.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.560]   I have all these pathogens in my tummy
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.600]   and I started gaining weight,
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.640]   but I'm eating really well.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.960]   I'm sleeping good and I am working out a ton
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.360]   and I was gaining weight in not a good way.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.960]   And I was like, what the hell is going on?
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.360]   And I've had, they're just really hard to get rid of
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.560]   the pathogens in my tummy.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.360]   And so I just drank,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.800]   I drank six ounces of milk every two hours
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.960]   for 12 hours for eight days in a row.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.160]   And that's all I had all day.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   And it was so gnarly, Chris,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.840]   like by day five, I'm like,
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.920]   oh my God, I had lost 10 pounds and I needed to.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.800]   So I was stoked on that,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.640]   but it was probably all water weight, but whatever.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   But by the end of this morning,
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.640]   I woke up so proud
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.480]   because I just did something so hard.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.800]   And I think it's so important to do hard things
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.480]   and to push through 'cause I almost quit
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.400]   and I almost cheated like a hundred times.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.680]   And my kids saw me doing this.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.760]   My kids were like, I'd make dinner for my whole family
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.480]   and I couldn't eat it
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.920]   and they would just tease me with it.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.000]   So anyhow, so I have been doing
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   the standard process cleanse for over 15 years.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.480]   I do that once a year.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   And that's just to clean out all of my organs
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.800]   to make sure everything's running smoothly.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.240]   By the end of it, I feel like a million bucks.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.520]   So I would highly recommend you guys.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.280]   - And is that just like a fast or what is that?
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.040]   - No, you can use as much as you want,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.240]   but just of what's allowed.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.200]   So no butter, no alcohol, no caffeine, no bread.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.440]   It's a lot of fruits and vegetables and protein.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.040]   And they give you shakes and pills,
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   but it's a pretty incredible cleanse
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.440]   'cause you're just really eating very cleanly,
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.800]   a very balanced diet.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.400]   And you start to taste food again
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.760]   and you just cut out all this stuff.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.920]   Like I drink a lot of drinks every day
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.280]   and it all adds up,
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.920]   even if it's like a holistic tea.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.000]   And with some collagen, those are calories
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and those are, you know, it's processed.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.760]   So that's something I'm very mindful of.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.200]   I partnered with Seeking Health,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.320]   which is a supplement company that I am in love with.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.680]   I researched them for over a year
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.720]   before I signed with them
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.800]   because I just, A, I wanted to work,
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.720]   but I fell in love with their science
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.840]   and with their efficacy.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.040]   So my kids and I and my husband all use these products.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.760]   And every single person in my ginormous family
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.520]   will be getting Seeking Health products,
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.720]   whether it's vitamin C or zinc or vitamin D plus K.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.720]   And they're stockings this year.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.840]   So I think that's huge.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.480]   And then also the stuff I do outside of training,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.560]   diverse training, strength training, Pilates,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.120]   I do this, it's called pillar principles.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.120]   I don't even know how to explain it,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.440]   but I do a lot of stillness work and poses
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   and I try to create space in my body.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.040]   And then I can fill muscle in
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.960]   instead of just packing muscle on this frame
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.080]   that's misaligned.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.920]   So that's something else I do.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.840]   But the cold plunge is something
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.360]   that I'm 100% in love with.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.920]   I do it probably four days a week
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.200]   for four minutes at a time.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.280]   I will go in the sauna for 45 minutes.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.360]   I get all, I sweat the toxins out.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.280]   I sit there, that's hard as well.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.880]   And then I go straight to the cold plunge,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.160]   which is at, right now it's at 43 degrees.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.920]   I sit in there for about four minutes
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.600]   and then I'm done.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.800]   So all these things are, it's all the elements.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.080]   You want the protein, you want the fat,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.920]   you want the cold, you want the heat,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.600]   you want the resistance training.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.000]   And then I get the exercise in my relationships
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.680]   as far as kind of connection, all these things.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.400]   I read a lot.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.080]   So all these things add up
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.000]   to being a high performer in my case.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.440]   Everything is body, mind, and spirit.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.920]   - Yeah, it's funny you mentioned the cold plunge.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.520]   I was talking to my wife about a cold plunge
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.720]   and I was like, "What's the hack to do a cold plunge?"
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.840]   And I was reading these articles
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.160]   about buying a freestanding freezer
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.840]   and like sealing off the joints.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.080]   You can turn a freezer into a cold plunge.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:24.800]   And it's like, you know.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.400]   - I've done everything.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   And then we found, literally it's called
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.960]   thecoldplunge.com and it's plugged in.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.560]   - Yeah, I saw it.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.400]   But then I was like, "Gosh, this freezer version
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.200]   is like $800."
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.160]   - No, no, money is one thing.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.040]   But then you have to buy the ice every single time.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.960]   Like we went so far as we had the industrial tub
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.400]   that they have in hospitals.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.080]   We bought an ice machine.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.680]   And we were just so invested.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.800]   But it was such a pain in the ass
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.400]   'cause the ice couldn't recycle fast enough
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.280]   for how much we needed
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.720]   and they didn't make enough ice.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.040]   So we've lived so many iterations of this.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.160]   And then we found the cold plunge
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.280]   and it's saving us money.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.240]   It's saving us time.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:00.960]   It makes it easy.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.040]   And now there's literally no excuse not to do it.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.480]   So I would recommend everyone
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.160]   who's in this life optimization
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.240]   and performance optimization part
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.200]   to go check it out.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.720]   'Cause for the immune benefits,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   for the mental benefits of resiliency
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.760]   and doing hard things
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   and just continually adapting,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.840]   like it is powerful medicine.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.120]   And it makes it so easy, Chris.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   I'm not even like, I'm not partnered with them
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   like at all.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.880]   I love them.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.480]   So I just, I would check into it.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.320]   And the sauna is next level as well.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.200]   They go hand in hand.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.320]   - I'm laughing because if you path my future,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.160]   it's going to be buying one of these.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.760]   If anyone's seen those meat freezers
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.240]   that they're like five feet, three feet.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   I'm going to go buy a meat freezer.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.640]   I'm going to go seal it off.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.680]   I'm going to fill it with water.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.120]   I'm going to add filtration.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.160]   And for six months,
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.360]   I'm going to be using this like DIY cold plunge
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.240]   and then it's going to break
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:46.960]   and I'm going to fix it.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.480]   And then eventually I'm going to say,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.520]   this wasn't worth it.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.200]   Just like the DIY Peloton,
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.400]   I'm going to go buy the real thing,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.520]   which I did there.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.080]   So I just, I like to at least experiment.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.760]   Maybe it's a great solution.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.680]   A lot of DIY things are,
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.280]   but I see for some reason,
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.000]   I'm like predicting my future of trying
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.520]   and giving up and doing the real thing.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.000]   - We all need to be mindful of the stories we say.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.760]   So if that's the future you want, speak to it.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.480]   But I like that.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.720]   I think it's so, it's like rangy, right?
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.280]   It's like the book,
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.040]   like you're developing more range,
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   like creating these experiences for yourself
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.760]   and you'll figure it out.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.480]   If it works, it works.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.840]   If not, it's going to lead you somewhere else.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.440]   But I love that you're just engaged with it.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.480]   That's like everything.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.680]   I'm going to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.400]   You've talked a lot,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.800]   a few different times about your family
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.400]   and you have three kids.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.680]   You actually, if I remember right,
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.800]   were pregnant with one of them
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.920]   while winning a gold medal.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.120]   - Yeah, my daughter.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.080]   - Yeah.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.240]   Has having them made it harder to perform
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.920]   or are there times you wish
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.360]   that you were doing one versus the other?
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.920]   And how did you manage that?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:50.000]   - You know, it's what I've always wanted
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.840]   was to be a working mommy, period.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.920]   So I know what I signed up for
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.760]   and I would never trade it for the whole wide world.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.840]   It's the best part, having both, right?
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.280]   Having two things.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.720]   My family is up here.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.320]   My career is very important to me,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.600]   but it's way down here.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.280]   But I spend more time in my career, you know?
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.200]   So it's like this crazy yin and yang.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.640]   So no, I love both.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.840]   I love both sides of me,
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.560]   both sides of my life in that way
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.840]   make me a better human.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.400]   My kids 100% made me a better athlete,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.200]   a better partner, more focused, more intentional.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.000]   So my kids have helped my career immensely.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.560]   Where it gets hard is the time management,
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.160]   is the guilt, all these things.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.360]   'Cause I thought it was really hard
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.560]   when my kids were infants
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.840]   and actually got to travel the world with them
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.040]   when they were babies on the road.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.480]   But now that they're older,
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.080]   it's like my kids are studs
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.440]   and they have their own lives.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.120]   I miss things and that's heartbreaking.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.720]   And so that's the only hard part to me.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.840]   I don't care about being tired.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.000]   I don't care about having to work all day training
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.280]   and then come home and be mommy,
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.560]   make dinner and do homework.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.000]   I love all of that.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.880]   But I do not have as much time to dedicate to my craft
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.560]   as I normally would watching video
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.480]   and getting body work and all these things.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.400]   All those things get put on the back burner
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.760]   because I have to prioritize.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.960]   So that's where it gets hard.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.080]   But I wouldn't trade it for all the money in the world.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.960]   It's my favorite thing.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   And it's very hard, but hard isn't bad.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.040]   I was talking to my best friend
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.200]   and it's like, we need to reframe the meaning
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.120]   and the vibe behind hard work.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.520]   We all carry it like it's the biggest burden.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.840]   When it's like, man, I'm so gifted and blessed
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.520]   that I love what I do with all my heart,
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.600]   that I'm willing to suffer so much for it.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.800]   'Cause that's true love.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.760]   I've suffered in my marriage
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.120]   'cause I love my man so much.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.080]   I've suffered for my children
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.120]   'cause I love them so much.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.680]   I suffer for volleyball 'cause I love it so much.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.960]   And so I think that's a blessing.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.640]   And I really love working hard.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.040]   And that's why I just think it's so important
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.200]   to have purpose and meaning behind what you're doing.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.040]   'Cause you're gonna suffer either way.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.120]   And if you do have purpose and meaning,
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.040]   then you're gonna be able to endure and outlast
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.280]   and you'll get to where you wanna go eventually,
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.960]   no matter what, even if it looks different
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.320]   than what you think it was gonna.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.920]   But if you hate what you do
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.760]   and you have no purpose and meaning you're suffering,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.160]   it's like, what's the point?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.360]   Make a shift there.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.640]   Not that it's that easy all the time,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.360]   but it kind of is.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.040]   I think we should all be doing things that are meaningful.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.680]   And even if you're custodian, God bless them.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.320]   If you love it and you're supporting your family
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.680]   and you're having these deep relationships
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.040]   with the people you're working with,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.560]   that's so powerful to me.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.720]   But if you hate every day and you resent it,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:11.520]   get rid of it.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.600]   Jordan Peterson is one of my heroes in life.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.640]   And he says, "Resentment is basically your body
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.360]   "and your mind shouting out to speak to something.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.040]   "Like something's off here."
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.440]   And so, yeah, I just wanted to share that
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.640]   'cause that was really powerful to me.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.760]   'Cause sometimes I feel that.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.880]   I'm like, why am I feeling this?
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.760]   I don't like feeling this way.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.520]   Now I'm gonna speak to it.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.320]   I'm gonna think about it first.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.640]   - Yeah, you've shared so many lessons.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.880]   Are there lessons that you've learned
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.640]   that you're consciously trying to teach
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.160]   or share with your children?
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.040]   - All of them, really.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.280]   It's pretty cool being at where I'm at in my career.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.720]   I'm literally like, it's 50/50 if I'm retired or not.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.640]   It truly is, which is such a weird place.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.320]   I've obviously never been here before.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.880]   But my children are competing at such a high level
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.840]   for their age group.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.800]   And I get to witness them striving and falling short
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.400]   and training certain things.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.080]   My husband took my son Sundance
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.320]   to the rec center this morning at 6.45
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.520]   to go work on dribbling.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.600]   That's commitment and that's family connection.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.360]   It's everything that's so special in life.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.680]   Anyhow, but when I watch my kids compete,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.760]   it just reinforces the things that I know
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.240]   are important for me to be a high performer.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.280]   If my kids get second or third in a race
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.200]   and they're devastated and they feel shame about losing,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.360]   I'm like, babe, that was incredible.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.160]   You tried your best.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.040]   What could you do better?
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.160]   But babe, that was just a rep at doing something very hard.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.720]   And you're gonna take this rep with you when you go next.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.800]   If you miss that layup, babe, don't worry about it.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.680]   If you get punched, this is gonna make you so good.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.320]   The hard stuff makes you so good
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.680]   because it fortifies you.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.600]   But you have to have that mindset
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.120]   that this is here to serve me.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.480]   And one of my founding principles
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.240]   is that everything in my life is here to serve me.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.680]   And all the hell I've had in my life
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.560]   has been in my own making.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.960]   Because of choices or poor thinking
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.760]   or taking things for granted or over obsession.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.120]   And I learned through all these things
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.240]   because it's there to serve me
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.000]   and it's there to help my soul grow.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.080]   And yeah, I love learning from my children.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.600]   They're little students.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.240]   And mostly it's, I feel like the call for all of us,
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.440]   especially this day and age,
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.840]   is to treat ourselves how we would treat our best friend
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.200]   or to treat our children.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.920]   If we F up, if we have a bad day, if we're in a hole,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.840]   like how would you speak to your child about that?
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.400]   And it's not baby talk,
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.040]   but it's just like,
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   you're never going to lay the hammer on them.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.360]   Like you can be strict and you can be, you know,
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.320]   like have conviction,
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.920]   but it doesn't mean be an a-hole.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.560]   And so I'm really trying to love myself
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.400]   and love my children in the same way
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.040]   so we can all grow in really holistic, healthy ways
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.240]   that center around like self-sourcing confidence,
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.600]   self-sourcing happiness,
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.320]   self-sourcing the feeling of success and satisfaction
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.680]   and not waiting for anyone,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.840]   anything or anyone outside of us to save the day
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.800]   or to make us be happy
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.560]   or to make us feel accomplished.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.960]   Are they all following the footsteps in sports?
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.400]   - They're all little ballers.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.120]   That's for sure.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.240]   They're so cute.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.320]   But they also, they're just, they're way more,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.920]   they're more rangy than me.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.640]   They like, they read and they write
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.560]   and my son sometimes says piano
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.680]   and Joey like is a love,
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.520]   he's a craftsman doing these things
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.200]   and Scoutie, my daughter's an artist.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.000]   It's so cool the access these kids have today.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.520]   And my husband's very, very good
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.200]   about getting the kids out of the house,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.040]   about introducing them to new things.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.560]   And we just see what sticks
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.840]   and we follow their curiosity
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.640]   and what lights them up.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.600]   And it's really beautiful.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.440]   - Yeah, I'm so excited.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.360]   You know, we have one daughter and she's 16 months.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.320]   - Yeah, have fun with her.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.600]   - She's just starting.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.880]   We're like, let's go to the library.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.760]   Let's go to the zoo.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.200]   Like you start to recognize things.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.280]   So it's really exciting to get them out
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.320]   and show them the world
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.120]   and all of the things that there are all over the place.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.680]   - Yeah, Chris and the relationship for a dad
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.960]   and their children is just,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.160]   I've just witnessed this so much.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.480]   I mean, it's obviously the mommy is sacred
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.360]   and it's so special,
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.120]   but daddies and daughters,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.880]   daddies and sons is just such an essential relationship.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   And it's just,
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.080]   I'm so excited for you to create that with your daughter
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.320]   because when my husband's not around,
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.200]   my kids are different.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.240]   Not that I'm not enough,
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.560]   but it's like they need both partners.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.600]   And it's such a beautiful thing
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.920]   when a daddy is a great father.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.760]   - I'm trying my best.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.320]   - That changes lives.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   I remember the first time I realized my dad believed in me,
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.120]   it changed my whole life.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.840]   Like I'm gonna cry.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.680]   And literally that's why I'm doing this today
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.960]   because of that one day
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.240]   playing horse against my brother
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.640]   and our best friend who were so good at basketball.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.320]   And he put his money on me
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.040]   and I swear to God,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.160]   it changed my whole life, Chris.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:24.960]   Like crazy.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.160]   So that's the power of a mentor or a parent
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.840]   or a loved one believing in you.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.800]   - Yeah, and that takes the same kind of presence
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.840]   that we talked about earlier
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.560]   to be there for those moments that believe in you.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.240]   - Yeah, and you don't need to be perfect.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.360]   You just need to be there.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.160]   Sincerely, like sincerity is magic as well.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.760]   It covers up all sorts of sins.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.440]   It covers up all sorts of perfection
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.720]   because you're there sincerely.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.280]   You're not trying to be or do or anything that you're not.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.400]   It's awesome.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.600]   - So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.160]   which is actually true almost every day.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.520]   And that's thanks to Viori.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.400]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.680]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.440]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.840]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.600]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.440]   You will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.600]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.440]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.720]   unless you're wearing Viori,
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.560]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.320]   And it's not just for men.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.200]   My wife is as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.760]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.200]   I think I have three pairs
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.280]   and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.320]   I've ever owned.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.200]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.680]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.160]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.120]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.160]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.600]   And for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.400]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.640]   at allthehacks.com/viori,
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.480]   or in the link in the show notes.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.640]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.720]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.040]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.560]   There is nothing I love more than learning
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.680]   that something I enjoy is actually so good for you.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.560]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.080]   It has so many health benefits
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.880]   and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.440]   is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.000]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.080]   using only wild harvested leaves
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.880]   from 250 year old tea trees,
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.000]   rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.400]   Then everything is triple toxin screened
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.320]   for pesticides, heavy minerals,
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.120]   and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.320]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.720]   because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.680]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.760]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.280]   They have so many products,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.320]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.920]   for mental clarity and energy,
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.280]   and the black Pu-Erh,
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.080]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.880]   with a rich earthy flavor that is so good
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.360]   and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.720]   And if you need another reason,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.120]   search for all the amazing research-backed benefits
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.440]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome,
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.040]   heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.680]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.480]   in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.160]   But you don't even have to take my word
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.280]   or do any research because Peak offers free US shipping,
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.000]   free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.200]   And for a limited time,
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.640]   you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.520]   with 12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.760]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.600]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.040]   P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.080]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.400]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.040]   - So part of this podcast,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.160]   there's a deep-rooted kind of love for travel.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.120]   And I wanna go somewhere interesting.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.720]   I looked online and you've played 149 tournaments
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.760]   outside of the US,
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.720]   which means in, by my count, 29 countries.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.160]   Any hacks from all these travel,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.680]   like what you do when you travel
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.240]   to make it more enjoyable other than upgrades?
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.800]   - Yeah, upgrades, number one.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.480]   I definitely bring a lot of hydration.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.080]   I think the water they give,
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.600]   I just, I'm not a big fan of the food
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.640]   or anything on airplanes.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.160]   Thank goodness for it, but I'm not a big fan.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.480]   So I source my own food, my own water.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.960]   I always bring a lacrosse ball or a softball
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.160]   to put in my back.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.280]   It's like we all get back problems
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.800]   when we're sitting down or my hips.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.120]   And that kind of is a distraction for my body
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.360]   and it helps relieve some pain and pressure.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.960]   And to me, I can't travel without it.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.560]   I'll roll my feet out, I'll roll my back.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.480]   And people think I'm weird, but it's like I need it.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.520]   There's these devices called Firefly recovery devices.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.120]   And basically it's this little device
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.160]   that you wrap around your knee
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.640]   and it's a pressure point that helps flush.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.800]   Like, you know how we all get cankles when we fly?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.200]   So it helps flush the circulation.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.680]   So, and it has a little vibration.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.600]   So you feel that distraction
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.560]   and then you keep your circulation going,
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.920]   which to me is really important.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.960]   It was so cool.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.480]   These things, Firefly was developed
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.560]   for people who have surgery, like leg surgery,
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.520]   and they have a lot of swelling
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.440]   and it just helps the recovery process.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.400]   So a lot of athletes do this after big matches, long days,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.720]   they put this device on them and it helps them recover.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.760]   I've brought TENS units, a STEM machine.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.560]   I've bought that.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.320]   If you're miserable,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.400]   you're going to try to find a way to alleviate pain.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.080]   And that was a huge one for me.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.600]   That was a really, really good one for me.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.520]   So just stuff like that.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.880]   I bring always a good book, make sure I have my charger,
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.240]   have all the essentials done
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.680]   'cause I'll panic if my phone dies.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.160]   - Yeah.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.520]   - Stuff like that, a pillow.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.720]   - Any place that you just love to go
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.960]   that you plan repeat trips to?
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.120]   - I rarely traveled for enjoyment.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.160]   It's always been on the circuit.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.280]   So we always go, once a year, we go to Stad, Switzerland,
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.520]   which is one of my favorite towns in the whole wide world.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.840]   It's at the base of the Alps, cobblestone streets,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.480]   just a typical, beautiful Swiss village.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.840]   Love it there.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.600]   You should go there, free on your miles.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.080]   They have one of the most amazing hotels called the Alpine
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.440]   that has, it makes, it puts no boot to shame.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.480]   Their sushi restaurant, it's incredible.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.360]   And then I love Paris with all my heart.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.520]   But yeah, we've gone to some really remarkable places.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.880]   I'm more of a European traveler than an Asian traveler,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.040]   even though I had really great experiences in Asia.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.560]   I just, I have more of a,
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.000]   I think I'm more comfortable over there.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:40.720]   - Yeah.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.360]   I hope you get to, I don't want to push off retirement,
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.040]   especially knowing how much you love Paris.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:45.440]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.040]   - Paris coming up in a few years.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.880]   But I hope that whenever that day comes,
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.480]   you get to start traveling more for fun.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.680]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   I, it's part of the, it's part of the vision board.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.200]   I'm a very big believer in vision boards
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.880]   and you got to see it,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.320]   you got to see it to bring it into your life
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.280]   and your experience and travel is one of my loves for sure.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.680]   I just, I want it with my family more often than not.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.120]   Like when my kids, you know, get older,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.400]   I can't wait to travel with my husband.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.000]   Traveling is just such a beautiful gift.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.480]   - It's funny, we've talked about your retirement,
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.320]   but you started a company.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.120]   And so it's funny that even if you stop playing volleyball,
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.160]   you're not stopping working.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.920]   - I can't, I can't afford it.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.000]   - I mean, it's funny because you, you're a pro athlete.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.920]   You talked about how you didn't have enough time
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.720]   to balance work on the, on the court and your family.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.920]   And yet you started a company.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.400]   What inspired you to take one other huge thing on
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.280]   in your life with, with almost no free time?
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.680]   - Well, as with everything in my life,
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.360]   the team, it makes everything possible.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.640]   This is not a solo mission.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.360]   Otherwise this would have lasted maybe half a day
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.960]   because being an entrepreneur, as you know,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.240]   is as gnarly as it gets.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.920]   It makes being an Olympian like a walk in the park.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.640]   Like as far as I'm concerned, you know, being an athlete,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.680]   like I just love that I live and die based on my own results.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.960]   Being an entrepreneur, there's so many more variables,
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.040]   different people's timelines and all these things.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.320]   So I really have a lot of respect
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.760]   for the entrepreneurs out there.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.680]   A lot of the things that are required to be a great athlete
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   are required to be a great entrepreneur,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.640]   which I really respect.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.080]   So I've, I've good training there.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.320]   Sport has given me everything in, in my life.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.280]   It gave me my husband.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.480]   I've been all around the world.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.760]   I got a college scholarship.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.840]   I've learned so many valuable life lessons.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.240]   And so I really want to lead the sport better
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.600]   than when I showed up.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   And the sport of volleyball is so underserved
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.720]   as we talked about before,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.440]   not just in prize money and people's ability to earn,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.120]   but just, just in growth
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.800]   and the way the market responds to us,
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.320]   there's huge opportunity there.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.920]   And so within 1440,
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.320]   we're just here to serve the community that is very hungry,
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.720]   that is very underserved, that is very deserving.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.480]   You know, so we have two sides of us.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.800]   We have our event side where we allow,
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.920]   where we create opportunities,
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.240]   where these kids can compete at events.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.160]   We just started this year where
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.840]   at the end of our six event series,
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.280]   it's called the Futures Tour.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.760]   The top 40 points earners are going to earn
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.920]   over $110,000 to go toward their club fees
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.040]   and toward their pursuit of a college scholarship.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.800]   So we love that we're easing that pain point
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.400]   because it's a really expensive proposition
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.080]   to be a club sport athlete these days.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.920]   So the Futures Tour is allowing us to give back
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.360]   so they get to compete at a high level
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.200]   and then earn prize money to go
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.000]   toward subsidizing their futures, which is beautiful.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.840]   And then we have the digital program side of us
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.160]   where it's all about health and wellness and volleyball.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.920]   And so we can train you in all sorts of things.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   So it's pretty powerful.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.120]   I'm honored to do it.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   It's a really hard job.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   I'm in this chair most days on Zoom calls all day
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.000]   and sending emails.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.280]   And that's actually another driver
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.400]   for me not to retire yet
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.320]   because this is a different kind of hard
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.840]   and I'm out of practice with it.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.200]   And it's not my favorite,
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.520]   but the community we're growing and building
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   and the impact we're having
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.560]   and we continue to grow into, it makes it worth it.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.000]   So I'm willing to be uncomfortable
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.840]   for those things I love, like I mentioned before,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.160]   but shit, this is just crazy.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.680]   - Yeah, I've started companies and it is a lot of work.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.360]   Are there specific things that you have learned
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.360]   as an athlete that you think
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.040]   people listening to this in business
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.160]   would benefit from learning
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.480]   that you've applied running the company?
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.320]   - Well, all of it really.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.080]   I mean, just consistency.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.840]   You know that we are our habits,
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.840]   so make sure your habits are on point.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.760]   I really, one of the first lessons I learned
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.360]   through our investor who's incredible,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.400]   her name's Teresa,
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.200]   is that every time we have a board call
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.640]   or a financial call,
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.400]   like she tackles the hardest thing first.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.080]   Like money makes me really uncomfortable, right?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.120]   It like makes me scream.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.560]   And on every call I've ever been on
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.520]   when money is involved,
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.640]   usually it happens at the end
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.600]   and we're all dreading this call
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.640]   if we're on here for an hour.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.400]   And at the end we get to the nitty gritty.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.320]   She tackles the hardest thing first
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.760]   and it changes everything.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.360]   And it allows for so much more freedom
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.000]   and engagement.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.920]   And to me, that was very, very powerful.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.600]   When you're on a phone call,
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.120]   just address what needs to be addressed
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.440]   candidly, respectfully,
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.280]   and just get the hard part over with first.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.040]   I think the importance of resilience,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.800]   that resilience is a choice.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.080]   Resilience is a mindset,
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.200]   is really, really important
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.240]   because as we all know,
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.560]   as in life and being an entrepreneur,
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.680]   you're going to take hits
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.880]   you never saw coming.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.760]   You're going to stumble,
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.280]   you know, kind of risks you took
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.160]   are not going to pan out.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.440]   And so you have to be resilient.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.400]   You have to be nimble.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.600]   Let's know what your goal is,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.520]   but be very flexible in getting there.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.480]   That's been a theme in my career for sure,
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.600]   because nothing is linear.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.440]   Leaning on your teammates,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.960]   having hard conversations,
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.280]   getting dirty with the things,
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.160]   you know, don't like,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:20.960]   if you have an idea,
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.320]   like see it through execution,
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.760]   don't just throw your idea to your team
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.520]   and expect it to come out the end
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.560]   where you want it to be.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.880]   You got to stick with the process type of thing.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.320]   So all these beautiful things,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.280]   it's really, really important.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   And then just, I really believe that
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.080]   so much in life,
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.600]   everything in life is energy
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.040]   and so much of the success
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.000]   and satisfaction of life
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.360]   comes from a mindset.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   And so one of my favorite quotes is,
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.720]   it's not the weight you carry,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.400]   it's the way you carry it.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.800]   And so as we go through hard things in business
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.760]   and the, you know,
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.280]   it's like we keep being overloaded
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.720]   with all this weight and stress
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.400]   and burdens and challenges.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.680]   It's like, how are you going to carry your weight?
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.880]   Are you going to carry it like it's heavy?
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.400]   Are you going to carry it like you got it?
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.760]   You know, and that's kind of metaphorical,
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.280]   like with your thinking,
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.640]   with your emotional state,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.680]   with your physicality,
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.120]   like I got this.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.320]   That mentality is really,
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.520]   really important, obviously,
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.480]   when you're an entrepreneur,
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.360]   because you have to find a way.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.400]   It's your job, you know?
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.720]   It's literally, I've had moments where it's like,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.560]   there's no person above you.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.000]   Like you have to solve the problem.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.240]   Like in so many parts of life,
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.520]   if you're, you could pass it on
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.240]   or you can get advice,
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.520]   but like at the end of the day,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.280]   you're like, I don't have a choice.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.480]   I have to solve this problem.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.200]   It has to be done.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.520]   - Yes.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.040]   - And I'm jealous of all the training
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.800]   you had solving difficult things
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.560]   before you jumped into entrepreneurship.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.320]   And I'm excited to see what the future entails.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.960]   And I've had the fortunate benefit
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.320]   of being able to see some,
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.560]   you know, live beach volleyball games,
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.840]   which I think, you know,
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.360]   Trump's seen it on TV.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.040]   So I hope some of the tours
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.000]   you guys are putting on
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.280]   are in places that people listening
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.320]   get a chance to go see it,
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.760]   because, you know,
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.440]   you said it's the number one sport in the Olympics.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.120]   Seeing it in person is next level.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.800]   - It is next level.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.720]   Yeah, it's such a big fun party.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.840]   It's so inspiring.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.680]   I think it's, like I said earlier,
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.120]   like encouragement is so important.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.320]   I think it's so important
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.720]   just to create like moments of inspiration
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.280]   in your days
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.200]   and to seek out the inspiration in your life.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.280]   And like the sport of volleyball is one thing.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.720]   Like I love watching the Warriors.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.160]   I love beautiful art.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:10.880]   Like I just,
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.200]   I think it's upon each of ourselves
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   to curate our life experience
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.080]   and our environments
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.680]   and what we introduce into our lives.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.840]   And yeah, choosing, inspiring,
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.120]   encouraging things are beautiful.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.800]   - Yeah, I think I've shared this before,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.760]   but I'll share it with you.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.120]   One thing that I started doing
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.280]   was I created a spreadsheet
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.120]   and every month I have to do
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.520]   some memorable, inspiring experience.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.080]   - Rad.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.080]   - And usually it just,
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.840]   I'm fortunate that something happens
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.120]   and I'm like, great, it happened.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.360]   But it's come the 25th of the month,
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.800]   if there's nothing, I'm like,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.920]   we gotta go do something.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.440]   Like whether it's a new museum,
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.240]   whether it's a show,
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.920]   whether like it has to be something,
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.520]   we can't have done it before.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.240]   It has to be something
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.400]   that we wouldn't just regularly do.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.280]   And so I have this list from 2015
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.440]   of all of the things that happened each month.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.960]   There were a few months during COVID
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.400]   where there just wasn't a thing.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   And I was like, I have the choice
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400]   of trying to make something up and say,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.840]   oh, we did this little thing.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.440]   And so I just took the L
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.120]   and said for these three months,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.000]   we just did nothing.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.360]   And I failed for those.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.640]   - You're forgiven.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.760]   - Yeah, but going forward, it's coming back.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.960]   And each month it's let's do something memorable
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.000]   because my, I can't remember where this came from,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   but I couldn't imagine a world
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   where you look back
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   and there was a month long period of your life
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.600]   where there was nothing memorable that happened.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.680]   And so I started documenting,
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.360]   making sure that something happened
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.960]   and it's been really awesome to do.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.560]   - That's incredible.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.480]   What a great suggestion for all of us.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.120]   You're so right.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.800]   Like we're just all automatons
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.920]   and just walking through life.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.200]   And I know we have high moments
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.640]   and low moments in every day,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.000]   but like creating memories.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.520]   And that to me is like the power
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.640]   of intention and commitment.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.520]   You're committed to it
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.920]   and your enthusiasm when you spoke about it,
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.680]   like that's awesome.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.120]   I think it's really powerful, good work.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:53.840]   - It's not hard.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.600]   It's just do something new and fun.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.040]   It doesn't have to be expensive.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.480]   So I encourage everyone to do that.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.760]   - And commit to it.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.480]   Commit, you commit.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.920]   The decision is the most important part
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.120]   of the journey, right?
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.960]   Once you commit, don't hedge your bets, like go.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   - Well, this has been fantastic.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.000]   Before we go,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.120]   where can people follow what you're doing?
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.200]   Find out what you decide in June
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.000]   and kind of track you along the way.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.520]   - I would be greatly honored
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.920]   if people could follow @platform1440
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.280]   across all social channels.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.400]   I am @caroleewalsh across all social channels.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.400]   P1440.com is really important.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.360]   - Yeah, we're going to have
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.440]   some new digital program coming out,
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.760]   programs coming out early in the year,
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.200]   2022, which is madness.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.240]   For 1440, that's all centered on resetting
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240]   and just, it's like an initiation,
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.000]   like starting your year off powerfully
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:40.960]   and getting rid of the baggage
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.600]   so you can create the 2022 of your dreams.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.440]   And it's all centered on body, mind, and spirit.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.720]   I really like that trifecta.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.000]   So you'll get some strength training,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.040]   some agility training,
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.240]   some mindfulness training,
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.360]   and some nutrition as well.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.120]   So all that stuff is really fun for me to share.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.200]   So I encourage everyone to check that out.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.880]   But no, but thank you for this, Chris.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.760]   This was really fun.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.680]   I'm really proud of you.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.400]   I'm very excited that your success makes sense
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.920]   with your podcast
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.520]   for the way you lead a conversation.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:05.920]   Great job.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.840]   - Yeah, thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.280]   - Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.280]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.960]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.480]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.840]   and a review for the show
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.920]   in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.680]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.960]   Especially Spotify,
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.600]   since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.200]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.080]   questions for me,
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.520]   or just want to say hi,
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.840]   I'm Chris@allthehacks.com
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.760]   or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.800]   That's it for this week.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.760]   I'll see you next week.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.240]   - I want to tell you about another podcast I love
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.560]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.240]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.400]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.640]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.520]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.680]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.640]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.560]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.800]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.760]   can build wealth.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.440]   And his passion and excitement
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.920]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   I know because I was a guest on the show
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.760]   in December, 2022,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   but recently I listened to an episode
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.080]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.360]   that will blow your mind.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.200]   And it was so crazy to learn things
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.160]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.080]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.040]   And that's just one
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.760]   of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.480]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.560]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   and hacks to help you get better with your money
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.000]   and grow your wealth.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.400]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.720]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts, and enjoy.
