[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.200]   Hello and welcome to another episode of all the hacks show about upgrading your
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.560]   life, money, travel, all while spending less, saving more.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am so excited to have you here.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520]   Okay.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.200]   So today's conversation is going to be really fantastic because I'm talking
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.800]   with Kerry Walsh Jennings, who is widely regarded as the greatest female
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.560]   beach volleyball player of all time.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.500]   She holds the beach volleyball record for most Olympic medals, three gold and a
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.760]   bronze, most career victories, and has the highest earnings of any female player.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.120]   She's been a pro for over 20 years.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.840]   She's won three world championships.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.800]   She's played in over 250 tournaments in 30 countries.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.640]   And while she's still competing, she and her husband, Casey, also a pro
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   volleyball player started P1440 in 2018, which is a digital platform exclusively
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.920]   built around the sport and culture of beach volleyball.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.000]   Honestly, I'm a bit intimidated here, but I'm also really excited.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.160]   I know it'll be a great conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.200]   Kerry, thank you for being here.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.040]   You nailed that intro.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.600]   High fives to you, Chris.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.960]   That's a, that's a really good start.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.760]   And obviously there's no need to be intimidated.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.040]   I think in person that might make more sense because I'm so big, but not, not via Zoom.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.160]   Yeah, well, when we met, I think it was about 2018 as well.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.080]   We were at a conference.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.720]   I believe you were drinking some type of mushroom tea.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.600]   Does that sound right?
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   Probably.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.480]   Probably a stigmatic lion's mane or something to get my brain going.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   I would say most people would find that an unusual beverage choice.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.440]   What do you hang out with?
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.960]   That's all my, that's all my friends drink.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.720]   And is that, would you put yourself in the category of people who like to experiment
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.360]   with interesting things that might improve your mind and your health?
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.600]   Yeah, Chris, I, a similar to you, like I am on this, this mission for self
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.200]   optimization, self mastery.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.920]   Like I want to feel so good in my days and I'm very sensitive
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   at what I'm not feeling good.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.600]   As an athlete, we're so trained to suck it up and carry on and go through walls
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   and my shoulder's falling off, but I'm going to keep playing.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.680]   But as a human, A, that's just not sustainable.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.440]   I think it's admirable to a certain extent, but I think it's kind of dumb too.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.320]   But as a human, I just, I want to live a long life and I want to feel good in my life.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.720]   And so when it comes time to wellness and nutrition and these things that I can lean
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.840]   on to better optimize my system and therefore my energy and therefore my mood and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.560]   therefore relationships, I'm, I'm like all in.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   And so, yeah, I follow a lot of people on social media, listen to a lot of podcasts
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.360]   and everything I kind of digest is to help me improve my life.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.040]   Wow.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.480]   Okay.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.080]   So I definitely want to make sure we spend some time in this conversation
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.520]   about some of those things, but I want to go back to some of the early days first.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.960]   So I know you grew up in a family of sports.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.000]   Your dad played baseball, basketball.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.160]   Your mom played volleyball.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.480]   Do you think you ever expected to be the pro athlete you became?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   I expected to be a pro athlete, like 100%.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.760]   My first big dream was to be the first female pitcher in the major leagues.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.080]   That didn't work out.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   You know, I played, I played baseball with my brother and my dad as a
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.320]   coach until I was 14, I love baseball so much.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.680]   And then my second dream was to be the first female player in the NBA.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.120]   Didn't work out, but I love basketball.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   I played throughout high school.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.480]   And then when I found volleyball, I just knew I wanted to play it as long as I could.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.680]   And so I think growing up in the family that I did, I knew I wanted to compete.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.160]   I knew I wanted to be physical and I had no idea it would be beach volleyball.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.720]   Certainly David Epstein wrote this book range recently about how generalists are
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.360]   successful and he compared Federer and Tiger Woods and Tiger Woods was all golf
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.280]   all the time and Federer's parent mom, I think was a, was a tennis player.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.960]   And she was like, no, you got to play other sports.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   Do you think that generalist approach you had as a, as a kid playing
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400]   different sports helped with volleyball?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.560]   Oh my gosh.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.920]   Yes.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.280]   Range is like one of the most valuable things you can have because then you
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   just add more tools to your toolkit.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.520]   When you're challenging yourself in different sports, it's not just
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.800]   your body that's being challenged.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.680]   It's your nervous system.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.360]   It's your thinking.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.320]   It's your problem solving.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.760]   It's the way to navigate what's in front of you.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.200]   And yes, absolutely.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.600]   And I talked to so many parents and athletes today, Chris, who are like
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   their kids are being almost forced to make a decision when they're 10 years
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.800]   old, what sport do you want to do forever?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.280]   And what position in the sport?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.200]   So it's Tiger Woods is the unicorn of all unicorns.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.360]   He started when he was three.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.480]   I love that book by the way.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   It's an amazing book, Tiger.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.480]   He's the anomaly.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.920]   And I think for the broader range, big picture, scope of life, developing range
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.160]   by playing multiple sports, by playing in a band, by being in big club, whatever
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   it is developing range, because you try new and different things is just essential.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.880]   And for me, I think that's one of the big reasons why I'm still
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   going because I train that way.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.720]   I'm not just, I'm not a linear person.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.600]   I'm always curious.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.000]   My trainers are very curious and they're very leading edge,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.280]   but very traditional as well.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.800]   And so I'm always being challenged in different ways and my competency
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.440]   and capabilities just keep expanding.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.840]   If I think back to your childhood and mine being different, so many parents,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.600]   non-athletes, they're grinding and hustling every day at work, but I think
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.720]   it's unusual for them to bring that home.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.120]   And their kids don't actually see that hustle, that ambition,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.640]   because it stays at the office.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.680]   And with your parents being athletes, there was no way to hide it.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280]   Did that have a huge impact on you?
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.720]   And, and, and does that have an impact on your kids?
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   I love that you, you, you mentioned that because I swear to God, like one of the
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.920]   best gifts my parents have ever given me outside of their committed loving
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.560]   relationship for over 40 years and being very present in my life is the fact that
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.040]   I got to witness them competing with all of their hearts and all of their joys
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   and all of their misery.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.000]   Like I, my brother and I am, I have two little sisters.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.040]   We just, we were with them competing all the time, running around at softball
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.120]   fields and the bowling leagues and volleyball games and basketball.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   Like my parents are intense competitors and the whole family would compete together.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   They played on a softball team called family feud and my mom's one of eight.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.720]   So it was all the siblings and then all of the in-laws and it wasn't, they never
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   lost and there would be fistfights.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.160]   There would be, you know, shit talking.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.200]   There would be like everything that's the best and the worst in sports happened.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   And I got to witness it.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.040]   And then we talk about it and hear my parents debriefing on the game.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   And we go to pizza after they get pizza and beers.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.360]   And I'd be listening to the stories they told and it just, it got wired.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.880]   It was in my DNA, right?
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   In DNA already, but it got wired in my consciousness.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.920]   Like competition is so fun when it's just, even when it's hard, it's so fun.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.200]   So to me, that's one of the best gifts they ever gave me.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.920]   Absolutely.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.440]   Do you think there's a way that someone who's not a pro athlete, who has a
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.520]   traditional nine to five office job can bring that home to their family as well?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.840]   Because I know so many people who are so ambitious and competitive in work, but I
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.400]   don't think their kids ever see that.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.120]   Yeah, I think, I don't, I don't know.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600]   Cause I haven't lived that life yet.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.480]   You know, the nine to five and more traditional job, if I'm fired up about
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.400]   something, whether it's a zoom call or work I'm doing for 1440, even though it's
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.240]   not competition, if I'm fired up, I bring that home and I talk to my kids about it.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.880]   If I have a hard day, I talk to him about it.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.840]   If I have a problem, I talk to him about it.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.680]   And cause part of my process is speaking things out loud, you know,
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.760]   and my kids are geniuses.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.680]   So I lean on their wisdom and my husband as well.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.960]   And so I think one of the beautiful things we do in our family is that we share a lot.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.360]   We're really emotional humans.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.000]   So there's ups and downs and everything that we do and our kids are involved.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.800]   So if I have a great day at 1440, we had a new hire and we're kicking butt and we
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.600]   just pivoted out of this tough situation.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   They get fired up for me.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.840]   So when I share it, and I think it's really important, not only to celebrate
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.320]   the little wins, even if it might seem part of the mundane part of your life.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.480]   I just think it's important because you're choosing to spend time doing it.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.880]   And so I think if you can bring enthusiasm and bring that to your
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.760]   family, that's valuable, that it's a win.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.480]   A win is a win.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.280]   It doesn't matter what uniform you're wearing or not.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.280]   My, my daughter's only 16 months, but I'm, I talked to Sunil Gupta, who
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.600]   wrote this book Backable, and he said, before you do a pitch at work practice.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.320]   And he's like, practice in front of your kids.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   And I feel like there's this big ultimate kind of hack for your children, which is
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.920]   just show them the ambition and the hustle that you have, even if it's at the office.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.720]   There's so many people that say, leave work at home.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.760]   You can leave some of work at home, but bring home part of it and show your
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   kids how passionate you are about things or, or if they're side projects as well.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   Totally.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.960]   You know, I think that's so important.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.680]   I think it's just important to engage and your work life is a huge part of your life.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.400]   And so not that you want to bring everything home, but yeah, I think it's
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.000]   important to share what's going on in your office with your family, because
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.240]   it's going to give them a better picture of who you are, what you're going through.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   And that brings compassion and a kick in the butt if needed and a high five if needed.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.040]   So it's all good stuff.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.760]   Younger generations today.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.720]   So if I was a young person or a young woman wanting to play beach volleyball,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.520]   they have you to look up to, right?
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   You created this career with massive career, but I don't think my record in the
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.920]   nineties, beach volleyball was not a lucrative career financially by any means.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   How, how did you push through that as and forge a path with no
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.320]   one like yourself to look up to?
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.000]   Well, you know, I, I fancy myself an athlete, you know, I mean, I know I'm a
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.440]   woman, I know that I have that label, but I just, there were definitely pioneers
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.760]   before me is what I'm trying to say.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.160]   You know, you, if you know, beach volleyball or volleyball, you know,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.600]   Karthikurai, three-time gold medalist, Mike Dodd, Mike Whitmarsh.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.000]   Like there were pioneers before me that made a great living that were Olympians
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.200]   that did amazingly internationally and domestically and had this beautiful career.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   So even though they weren't women doing this, I had those role models
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.000]   and that's, that's a big gift.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.280]   And then when I came out to the beach in 2001, after I left Stanford and my first
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.000]   Olympics and paired up with Misty, it was just like lightning in a bottle, like the
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.640]   perfect storm with regard to timing, partnership, kind of the shift in culture
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.280]   where female athletes were being a little bit more celebrated and honored.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.840]   And Misty and I dominated.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.040]   And so I feel like just the fact that I always just wanted to be an athlete
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.160]   for athletes sake, not labeled anyway.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   I think I just see inspiration in everything and that's how I'm wired anyway.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   So if a boy is doing it, just cause I'm a girl, I'm not thinking I can't do that.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.000]   Something that was a little bit harder was when I wanted to have kids and not a lot
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   of professional female athletes did that while they're still competing.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.640]   And so that was something a little bit different, but my mom showed me,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.000]   you know, my mom had eight kids.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.520]   She carried triplets for her sister.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.600]   She was playing softball, like diving, sliding in the third base while she was
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   pregnant, having a kick-ass job, selling real estate, being very present with my
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.880]   father and making it, and having four kids of her own, you know?
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.920]   So I saw that in action and I've just, I've been so blessed to have these
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.960]   authentic role models, people who lead themselves first, who follow their
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.240]   passions and they align their passions with their personal lives, with their
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.600]   families and their relationships.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.760]   So it's been, I've been very blessed in that way.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.680]   I mean, I've heard a lot of people talk about kind of the finances
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.360]   of beach volleyball, right?
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.920]   Professional beach volleyballs are not making what, are not making what pro NFL
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.600]   players and, and, you know, basketball players are making.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.440]   How did that factor in early on?
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.960]   I imagine, I heard you say once on, you were on the indoor national team and
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.840]   you're making like a thousand dollars a month.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.080]   Did you, did you need side hustles?
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.760]   Like how do you make the bills?
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.080]   How do the bills get paid?
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.040]   How do you make ends meet?
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   How do you pay for trainers in a career where it's not as
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.560]   lucrative as other sports?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.400]   It's, this is such a long conversation.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.320]   You know, when I was playing indoor volleyball on the indoor team, making
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.760]   a thousand bucks a month, I got a raise to 1200 bucks and I was stoked.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.520]   But when you're on the indoor team, they pay for housing.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.400]   They pay for travel, your coaches are paid for.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.000]   So that's all in one little kit.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.520]   So I was broke, but I didn't have anywhere to spend money.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.640]   And I lived in Colorado Springs where like a fun Friday night was going to
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.280]   Walmart and like walking the aisles.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.720]   So I didn't, and I just wanted to win, you know, I was just focused on training
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.960]   and my life was very simple, not to disrespect Walmart or Colorado Springs.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.520]   So I loved it.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.160]   But beach volleyball, it's you, you pay to work.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.880]   Basically we, we train Monday through Friday.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.880]   You play on the weekends, you pay Monday through Friday for your coaches, for
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   your strength coach, for your nutritionist, whatever you have.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.520]   And then on the weekends you're hoping to recoup that money by your prize money.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.720]   And I can name probably maybe 10 athletes around the world that can only do beach
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.240]   volleyball and have it be their living.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.080]   And it's not because of prize money, it's because of endorsement deals, but the
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.240]   endorsement deals on the same time compared to other sports are just pennies
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.560]   to the dollar on the dollar.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.760]   And that's something with through 1440, my company and just through my life, like
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.720]   I really want to elevate the marketplace for, for volleyball in general, not just
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.680]   beach, but indoor as well.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.360]   Cause the sport is so wonderful.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.720]   The lifestyle is incredible.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.520]   It's so sexy.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.200]   It's family.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.160]   It's dynamic.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.680]   It's finesse.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   It's everything.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.960]   And for some reason, the marketplace hasn't really aligned to us.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.760]   We're the number one Olympic sport, you know, indoor beach combined every four
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.480]   years, it gets the highest ratings.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   So once every four years, we are the best thing in the world.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.400]   And then we go away.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.120]   But for me, I think winning led to more opportunities.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   I have a lot of side hustles.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.960]   I am an athlete.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.440]   I do speaking engagements.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.840]   I have my endorsements.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.240]   So photo shoots, all these different obligations, media obligations that I
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.880]   have that bring in the money.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.000]   And for me, as I go, I just want to keep opening more doors to revenue in my life.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.280]   I don't want just one.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.720]   Not that that's wrong, but I just, I want more diversity in my life.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.520]   I can't do anything every day I fade away.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.200]   So I like diversity in my life and my moneymaking opportunities.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.920]   And so that's what I'm encouraging and inviting in my life is more
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.960]   revenue streams coming in.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   It's a theme I see now is lots of people wanting lots of different side hustles.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.440]   Were there any side hustles early on when you didn't have your endorsement
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.680]   deals that were fun and good to share?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.760]   I had two jobs early on.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.640]   And then at some point my endorsement deals picked up, but I was a dog
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   walker for about maybe, maybe three months, maybe six, but it was so stressful.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.520]   The woman I took over for, she got hurt on the job.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.120]   She was walking two of the, one of the dogs that were the, like the Swiss Alps,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   like they're huge dogs, Bernice mountain dogs.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.280]   I think so.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.640]   So two ginormous ones, right.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.120]   And she's walking them at a cross crosses a cat crosses the alley.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.240]   They take off and drag her and she tore both ACLs.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.000]   And I was like, I'm an athlete.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.240]   This is what I'm walking into.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.120]   What am I doing?
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.840]   And so that was one job, but it paid well, people pay a lot
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.680]   of money for their pets.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.240]   And then I worked in a kid's shoe store and it wasn't necessarily for the money,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.840]   even though I needed money, cause I live very simply, but it was just, I needed
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.440]   something to do and I need to contribute in my life and be with people.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.640]   So those are the two solutions I had.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.680]   And then obviously camps and clinics and coaching.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.520]   I've done a fair amount of that, but I'm glad those days are over really.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.240]   I love how resourceful you were.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.040]   And I also love that dog walking is stressful when you're also an
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.240]   Olympian who's played on the world stage.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.680]   Well, I only had, I think two Olympics under my belt at that point.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.080]   So I was a rookie, but no, you know, it's like, my God,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.640]   these uncontrollable animals.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.840]   I do have a fun Olympics question.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.640]   So you worked hard, right?
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.120]   Three gold medals, but it was across three Olympics, four years apart.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.720]   I have to ask in 2008, Michael Phelps did the same thing.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.200]   Three gold medals in a little over 24 hours.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.800]   And I know it took you three Olympics and I know you're so supportive of team USA,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.760]   but it has to be a little frustrating when someone can get three golds in like
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.440]   almost a day and it takes you three Olympics.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.040]   It just is what it is.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.960]   You know, I, I don't want to be a swimmer.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.400]   If I, if I had a big enough issue with that, I'd be a swimmer and I'd try to go
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.800]   beat Michael Phelps his records, but no, you know, that's, it's just, that's why
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.760]   the different sports, you respect them for different reasons when I think the
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.320]   longevity in our sport is gnarly.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.840]   And if you can be a high performer and have sustained excellence and keep winning
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.880]   over a decade, like that's pretty unusual.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.720]   Michael has done his next level unusual, but he has different
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.840]   opportunities than I have.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.160]   I would never get mad at Michael for, you know, having 19 or more gold
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.480]   medals and everything he's done.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.400]   That man's incredible.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.960]   I would love to sit and talk to him about that because that's just a whole
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.680]   different, whole different ballgame.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.880]   We need to start a podcast.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.160]   I, yeah, I have some thoughts, but I don't know.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   You got to keep, you got to like, you do so well.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   Like, what did you say?
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.280]   You're in the top, what percent of podcasts?
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.000]   I mean, the show's been doing great.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.600]   We're in the top half a percent.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.760]   That is, I don't even know what that means.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.440]   That's a gold medal.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.240]   So that's incredible.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.440]   But you, cause you don't have acid and I just need to, you know, all these things
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.080]   require preparation and commitment.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.920]   And if I do it, I'll be inspired by you.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.840]   And I want to break that top three or top percent, but yeah, maybe down the road.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.440]   You mentioned gold medals.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   I got to ask, where do you keep the gold medals?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.640]   Are they, are they in a safe?
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.880]   Do you just keep them on the wall?
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.000]   No, they're in a little cute bag in my closet, just waiting to be brought to an
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.960]   appearance or shown to kids or something.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.160]   I gave one to my, I gave my first one to my parents, the one from Athens.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.600]   And my dad gave it back to you.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.720]   No, it was really yours.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.560]   You guys earned it.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.360]   And he's no, it's just sitting in her safe.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.040]   And you'll, you'll put it to better use.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   So yeah, the collection is together, but I feel like it's, I feel like
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.680]   it's a little bit short.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.400]   I really do want one more, but I'm just trying to figure out
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.360]   the retirement game or not.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.880]   One more.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   There's an opportunity coming, right?
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.200]   There is.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.440]   I gave myself until June to figure out if I'm retired or not.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.640]   I just needed some space cause I don't have a hundred percent clarity.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.600]   And I don't know if you feel the same, but like, I'm at this point in my life
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.760]   where I can't, like, I need something to be at a hundred percent F yes.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.080]   Or it's a no.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.360]   You know, especially with something that requires so much of your heart
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.480]   and soul and sacrifice and leaving family.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.680]   Like I need this to be a 100% plus.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.080]   Yes.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.720]   And I'm just a little bit on the fence.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.880]   And so I gave myself tell June to figure it out, but my heart wants it, Chris.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.520]   And I don't know if that's just the athlete in me, that's never going to die.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.280]   Or if this dream is just, I just believe, and I still, I'm still hungry.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.480]   I'm still physical.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.520]   I still feel great.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.480]   Oh, it's a life side of my life.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.320]   That would get in the way and not get in the way, but that would, you know,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.440]   make me choose retirement.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.000]   So we'll see.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Is it, is it more about pushing for another gold or is it more about ending on a gold?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And yeah, that's a great question.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.640]   I really do believe in fairytale endings and I want it like, so I can just say that,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   but I just feel, and I don't want to end on a bad note like this past quad.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.200]   Like I lost myself so much last year and I just literally forgot how to play
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.760]   volleyball, like emotionally I couldn't handle it.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.080]   And it was, it was, it was so many things I don't want to get into, but you know,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.480]   it just interfered with what I do best and that's a bummer.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.440]   And so there's part of that that I want to rectify.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.680]   But more than that, I love it.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.840]   And I believe that there's more and better in me.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.120]   And I have this dream of a partner who I want to play with, who we're going to get
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.360]   together after the holidays and see if there's any magic there.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.400]   And if, if, if we can commit to this, it's a hundred percent, yes.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.640]   I just got to go through the paces.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.120]   It's a process to figure these things out.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.280]   Apparently my whole life, everything is just unfolded and everything's made sense
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   and it just keeps happening.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.720]   And this is the first time in my life where I'm like, let me pause.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.920]   Let me think what I think I'm in trouble.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.680]   So I'm just like praying and just waiting to know, you know, I'm waiting to, I'm
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.360]   excited to see you and see you in Paris.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.160]   So one of those times where you had everything fall together perfectly from
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.360]   August 20, 2007 to August, 2008, you and Misty went on 112 match winning streak.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.680]   And most people in a year have some good weeks, some bad weeks.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.600]   I can't imagine that a whole year was just a whole year of good days.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.840]   Every single day, nothing was hard, but you guys won every time.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.400]   What do you do?
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.520]   Maybe you didn't have a bad day, but I'm going to assume you did.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.080]   How do you get past that?
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   And how do you still perform at that level when you're having a bad day?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.480]   Which I think for everyone is inevitable.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.160]   I mean, certainly there are a lot of near misses, near losses in that run.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   The world's very good.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.600]   And we had to play a lot of great teams.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.200]   Certainly there was a lot of injuries to play through and friction in our team
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.760]   to work through and friction in life.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.640]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.200]   It's Misty and I were literally magic.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.320]   So it's like something would happen on the court and either we'd start the
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.640]   match on point and we finished on match and just crush someone, or we would just
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.560]   start wonky and people would challenge us.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.520]   And then at some point we'd always just come together.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.880]   It's like the harder things got for Misty and I, the more uncomfortable it
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.480]   was, we just got closer together.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   And that is a legacy of, you know, that builds legacies.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.040]   We think about the Patriots or the Warriors or the Giants or whoever's had
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.400]   amazing, successful, longstanding legacies.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.640]   I think that it's that ability to come together when times are tough because
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.720]   you have that belief, you have that respect, you have that vulnerability
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.560]   and strength together.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.680]   And Misty and I had that for 10 years, basically.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.240]   But that run in 2007, 2008 was really gnarly.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.520]   And for me, that was the time of my career was where I was most obsessed.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.800]   Like 100% volleyball all the time.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.720]   And I had gotten married in 2005.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   I almost lost my marriage because of my obsession.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.720]   Like all I wanted to do is win, you know, um, prior, right after I got
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.840]   married, after the Athens games, I got pregnant and had miscarriage.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.040]   And then my husband, I decided to wait until after Beijing to try again.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.360]   And so in that period of two, two and a half years, I was like, if I'm not
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.600]   having babies, I am, I need to win.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.560]   And so I lost sight of my life and just got so focused on
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.800]   volleyball and we dominated.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.520]   Misty and I were so close.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.880]   Like, and our coach was so close.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   We were so rad.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.520]   We were so connected, which is beautiful, which is how you win.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.880]   But my life fell apart.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.520]   So I, even though we kicked ass and dominated and that was part of the record
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.400]   books, I would never want to go back there because everything that's most
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.240]   important to me almost was just blown away and destroyed to have a year like that.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.000]   I don't think it has to be that.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.920]   And that's why part of why I want to keep going.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.840]   It's God, I really, I can do this better.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.560]   Cause like I told you, moving forward to Paris, like I need to marry the
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.680]   intimate connection with my family, with the intimate connection I have
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.000]   with my partner and the journey.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.640]   Cause right now I haven't done that.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   And it's like, I have to peace out to my family for six weeks at a time.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.760]   And my heart can't take that anymore.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   It can't like literally I might die.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   It feels like that.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.920]   Cause I can't breathe.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.640]   I can't focus.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.440]   I feel so guilty, all these things.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.480]   And I miss my family so much and my kids are suffering for it and my husband.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.200]   So I really don't believe, I believe it requires obsession, but I believe
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.040]   there's a way to have a healthy obsession and to, to make sure that you're living
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.920]   life and being present wherever you are.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.400]   For me, it's, if I had a tournament in two weeks, but I was home, I could only
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.960]   think about the tournament in two weeks.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.680]   So it's like my time at home was wasted.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.480]   What do you think, if you could go back to 2007, what do you think you could share
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   to your younger self that would allow you to find that balance?
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   Well, I think it's just like, one of my favorite quotes is from my
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.840]   performance psychologist, Mike Gervais.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.120]   And he says, be where your feet are, like be a hundred percent where you are.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.480]   Because if you're on the court, then if you're in the moment and you're not
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.880]   worried about the past or the future, all of your tools and resource and focus
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.960]   and greatness is going to show up in that moment, if you're where your feet are.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.280]   Same thing in life.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.920]   If I'm with my husband, but I have a huge tournament, you know, coming
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.160]   up or a big game the next day.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.560]   But if I'm with him in that moment for that hour, that hour is going to feel
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.840]   like four days because I'm in the moment and I'm connecting with him sincerely.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.080]   So I think the antidote to so much stress and, and to, to make, to
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.760]   balancing your obsessions with your life obsessions is just to be in the moment.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.400]   And certainly we've all heard the, the kind of quote that what, what
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.000]   grows is what you nurture in water.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.120]   And so it's like, I went to this, I went to this, um, Tony Robbins, uh,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.160]   have your, do you know Tony Robbins?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.920]   So I went to one of his seminars and it was so amazing.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.440]   And one of the first thing he says, people have been jumping up and down
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.920]   for an hour straight waiting for him.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.200]   And one of the first thing he says is you guys, I know you guys all kick ass
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.160]   and you bring energy and love and passion to your jobs and everyone's like, yeah.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.360]   And he goes on a riff on that for a second.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.680]   And then he goes, but take a moment.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.440]   Think about the energy and the passion and the presence you bring to your
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.120]   relationships.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.520]   And everyone was like, Oh, like it was so deflating.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.480]   And it, to me, it was like such a slap in my face because my husband tells me that
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.880]   all the time, less now, because I'm working on it.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.160]   He's like, babe, you get everyone outside of this house, the world, your energy,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.080]   your focus, like you make them feel like they're the only thing in the world.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.720]   Then you come home, you're exhausted and your time with us is not as quality.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.800]   So can we fix that?
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.360]   And then when Tony said that, I was like, Oh my hell.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.400]   Yes, it's so true.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.960]   And so I feel like if, if I can give the energy and the love, it's a different
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.440]   expression of it, but the give the energy and love that I put to my career toward
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.040]   my family and whatever expression is real, that's, that's the game changer and do
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.880]   it consistently.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.440]   Like you can't just do it once in a while.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.680]   I can't appreciate my husband once in a while or be there for my kids once in a
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.000]   while.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.840]   Like I want to go metal as a mom too.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.520]   And a wife too.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.080]   So that requires every day.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.000]   Are there any kind of tricks or things you've added to your routine to make that
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.720]   work better?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.840]   Man, I, well, I was always involved, you know, but I was just kind of distracted,
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.720]   kind of agitated.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.480]   Like I was all there, but I was just like, it was kind of like a caged lion.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.360]   Like, fuck, let me, let me add it.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.160]   And that's almost embarrassing to say, but it's my, it's my truth.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.600]   But for me, you know, mindfulness, mindfulness practice is a huge part of my
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:35.920]   life.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.160]   When I started meditating and taking time to be in stillness every day, it really
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.920]   allows me to respond to life and not just be so reactive.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.840]   And I am a very emotional person.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.680]   So I feed off your energy.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.480]   If you're having a bad day, I kind of make myself have a bad day and I just want to
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.560]   control my environment.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.640]   So everyone's comfortable.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.480]   And when I meditate, when I have that stillness within me, I just, I'm, I'm more
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.760]   of an observer and I can respond in more healthy ways.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.360]   So that's really beautiful to me.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.720]   And I just made it a priority.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.760]   I, I've done a lot of self-help work.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   I did a lot of work with my performance psychologist, Mike Gervais, and he's like
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.080]   basically Carrie, he's like, you, you can't have it all, but you can have what
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.920]   matters most to you.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.720]   So figure out what matters most to you and then make those your priorities.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   So for me, I figured out what was most important to me and I put them in buckets.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.920]   So I have my, I have my faith, right?
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.240]   My God, my creator.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.520]   I have to connect to that because that empowers me.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.000]   That makes me empowered in life.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.600]   I have my family, right?
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.400]   I have my career and those three things, like those are my three things, my three
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.880]   buckets.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.800]   And so when I'm feeling out of sorts in the world, literally, if I take a moment
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.720]   and be like, Hey, out of my three buckets, what am I not serving?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.640]   It shows me what I'm not paying attention to.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   And so my life side of my life has to be a priority.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.720]   Otherwise everything else is going to be, I'm going to get bronzes or I'm not even
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.440]   going to qualify.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.640]   So, you know, things like that.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.440]   So much of performance is often not in the thing.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   It's, it's what's in your head.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.520]   It's what's going on outside.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.800]   But you mentioned you, you have a performance coach, mindfulness.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.720]   Those aren't physical things.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.120]   Do you think a lot of the success is more mental than physical in sports?
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.800]   I heard someone say, and I really love this because it's like, what's more
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.760]   important, the mental or the physical?
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.640]   And to me, like emotional is so important too.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.160]   But, um, this guy said, Andrew Huberman, Huberman lab podcast.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:23.760]   He's incredible.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.240]   He said, get rid of all that.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.720]   Everything is your nervous system, right?
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.440]   So your mental capacity, your emotional, your physical, it all is wrapped up in
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.240]   your nervous system.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.200]   And so I just think it's, it's everything all wrapped into one.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.880]   For me, I think the easier part of everything is the physical part.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.480]   I'm an athlete.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.440]   Like I can suck it up.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.480]   I can go really hard.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.520]   I can do these things.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.000]   The harder part is pulling back if I'm injured, like recovering, prioritizing
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.560]   sleep and nutrition and going to my performance psychologist, you know, kind
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.360]   of the softer skills, but that, but to me, the softer skills make me lethal, you
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   know, and they enhance my physical skills.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   So I don't think there's an answer to that question.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.960]   And the fact that everything impacts everything else.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.360]   And if we could all have healthy nervous systems, because we pay attention and
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   fuel our body, mind, and spirit, then we could all kick ass longer and feel
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.400]   better while we're doing it.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.680]   Like, I don't want to, I don't want to grit out and grind out a journey that I
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.320]   hate and get to the end and be like, Oh, we won, but that sucked.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.800]   I never want to do that.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.840]   I really do want to enjoy my days.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.800]   And so for me, it's about creating processes, hanging out with people,
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:30.160]   making sure my environment allows for that joy, that positive energy in my day
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.840]   is because I know that serves me best.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.600]   I I've not been fortunate to have a, a mentor or performance psychologist.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.080]   What are some of the lessons you've learned from that relationship that people
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.960]   listening might be able to apply to their home work lives?
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.880]   Well, outside of the mindfulness practice, which, you know, it's like for me, and
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.240]   Tony Robbins mentions this as well.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.560]   He's like, whenever you're feeling so overwhelmed and so in your head or so
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.920]   just stuck in life, he's like, get out of your head and get into your body.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.880]   Right.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.320]   So that was a big thing for me because I tend to, I want to fix everything.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.480]   I want to know the answer.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.400]   Like, I want to be able to speak, articulate to everything.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   And if I can't, then I get overwhelmed and then I just don't know what to do.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.440]   And so go take a walk, go for a run, get in the sauna, you need to do something
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.200]   to get back into your whole system.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.720]   And I think that's really helpful.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.840]   So for me, Mike, Mike Gervais gave me this practice, like before I get in the
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.560]   car, I turn the car on and I actually listened to the ignition, right?
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.720]   I feel the steering wheel in my hand.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.920]   So anything to like connect my body, my, all my senses, like that brings you back
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.480]   to the moment.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.120]   And again, if we're in the moment, then we can attack our lives beautifully, more
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.160]   powerfully than if we weren't in the moment, rushing through and racing through
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.320]   something else that really helped me with Mike Gervais is that he just, he, he
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.760]   doesn't do the work for you, but he kind of, he highlights the work you have.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.320]   And I, he helped me realize how much baggage I carry around and how I have
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.120]   just these ridiculous expectations.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.720]   And mostly actually is how, how important my self-talk is to my success and my
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.840]   satisfaction in life.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.200]   And what he says, which I know to be true at this point is that self-confidence
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.840]   comes from one place and one place only.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.600]   And that's the way you talk to yourself.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.880]   And so Mike Gervais is a huge proponent of having a positive in the very least
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.640]   neutral self-talk where instead of belittling yourself and saying, Oh, you're
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.960]   idiot.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.400]   All you effed that up or we're going to lose.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.760]   It's like, that's going to give you momentum in the totally wrong direction.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.400]   So if you find yours, if you have the awareness to hear yourself talking
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.080]   yourself like that, you have the awareness, you catch yourself and then you
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.880]   choose better.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.520]   So choose a neutral thought because it's hard to go from, Oh, you're the worst in
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.800]   the world to you're the best.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.240]   That's, that's not credible.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.880]   So go from, ah, that sucked.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.360]   You're terrible to let's restart.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.840]   Let's try this again.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.720]   I got this.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.560]   I'm ready for this.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.320]   This is part of it to neutral talk.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.040]   And then from neutral, you can go, you can go into more positive talk.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.960]   So I think the, I think the inner critic is very valuable, but the self-talk that
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.520]   you have really, really determines your performance.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.680]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.280]   So I'm just thinking, imagine I finished an interview and it wasn't great.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.360]   Would it be fair to say, instead of saying, God, that was horrible to say,
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.600]   that wasn't my best.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.160]   Is that, is that neutral or, or help me help me nail down what neutral is.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.240]   I think it's like, I don't think you lied to yourself.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.560]   Well, yeah, no, I think that's fair.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.320]   I think that's fair.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.760]   And then you'd be like, Hey, what could I do better?
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.440]   What did I do?
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.680]   Well, you know, after every game, we have a debrief where it's like, what
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.320]   do we do good individually?
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.000]   What can we work on individually?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And then collectively.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.360]   So for, for something like that, it's, did I prepare well enough?
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.440]   Was I rushing?
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.680]   How did I feel on my body?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.080]   Like, how could I have made the environment more amenable amenable
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.440]   to having a great podcast?
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.160]   These types of things.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.120]   I think these thoughts are great, but in the moment, I think it's really
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.840]   important to be neutral or positive or encouraging in the very least.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.600]   Encouragement is such a huge thing in life.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.160]   And then after, yeah, you just don't beat yourself up.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   You can acknowledge it and be like, Hey, I'll do better next time.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.920]   How can I do better?
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.680]   And then you carry on, you know?
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.480]   I mean, this must be easy.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.880]   I know your nickname, six feet of sunshine.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.640]   You have this positive attitude and joy.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.880]   Is there, is there a secret to all that happiness and success and joy that
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.440]   keeps you having all this positive self-talk and, and not even self-talk
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.000]   outward talk?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.080]   Well, it's my, my, my self-talk is way is gnarly.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.000]   You know, I have a lot of room for improvement for sure.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.920]   You know, I definitely speak outwardly more positively in general,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.720]   but, but I do, it's authentic to me to be positive nature and nurture.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.240]   My, my family's that way.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.560]   I don't have any pessimists around me.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.400]   I don't have a lot of cynics around me.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.480]   I have a lot of curious people around me.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.240]   A lot of people who have a lot of faith around me.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.720]   And I, so I think, and I'm just a very faithful, optimistic person by nature.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.640]   And then in my life experience, when I have been cynical, when I have indulged
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.080]   in like woe is me and feeling terrible and being overburdened by a challenge.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.720]   Thinking in a, thinking in a more negative way takes me so far from what I want.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:55.120]   So now it's, if I fail, I've re revamped it in my head where, okay, that was a rep.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.920]   That rep shows me what, where I can improve and I'm determined to improve.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   So now I go to work and that could be a mental rep.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.320]   It could be a physical rep, but that's, that's a positive way to frame these things.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.760]   It's, it's a repetition of something.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.320]   And then I just get curious.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:09.840]   It's okay.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.520]   So if I, if I'm having this podcast and I want to kick ass and I almost want it too
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.640]   bad, and I'm feeling so much anxiety that I can't even have this conversation.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.360]   I want to be curious about my anxiety.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.480]   What am I, what are my thoughts before the podcast?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.560]   What are my thoughts during?
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.200]   And just self-awareness to me is like a superpower.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.920]   And if we can develop self-awareness of how we feel in certain situations, how we
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.160]   feel around certain people are kind of our routines, all these things, like we have
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.280]   so much more control in our lives than I think we think.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.840]   And I think what I said earlier is that when you find yourself in a funk, like if
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.680]   you find yourself thinking terrible thoughts, that self-awareness that you're
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.480]   having that, but the, the real thing is sometimes we think our, our thoughts are
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   thinking for us, but that's just cause that's a habit.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.400]   Like we can stop that and flip the script and choose better.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.480]   And my, my philosophy is always just choose better, you know, and if you focus
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.880]   on the solution, then the solution is going to come.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.920]   If you focus on the problem, the problem is going to seem like, and it's going to
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.680]   envelop you.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.000]   It's kind of law of attraction type, type stuff, focus on what you want, not what
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.480]   you don't want.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.240]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.560]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.200]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.480]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.840]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.560]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.360]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.800]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.440]   right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.240]   And it's not just for men.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.000]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.680]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.600]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.240]   ever owned.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.200]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running,
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.480]   training, or yoga.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.640]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their MetaPants can even
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.720]   work for a night out.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.120]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.680]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your first purchase, as

[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.720]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.240]   is that I am definitely not.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.240]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.480]   kickstart my day with Athletic Greens and I am excited to be partnering with them for
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.240]   this episode.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.560]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I've kept
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.680]   it in my daily routine for months.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.520]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.120]   good when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day,
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.480]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.680]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, and superfoods
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.160]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.320]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.160]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.320]   supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.920]   purchase.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:30.280]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over your
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.320]   health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.920]   You talked a lot about self-awareness.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.960]   Does that come mostly from your mindfulness practice or where does some of that come
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.160]   from?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.240]   Um, you know, I think I'm a pretty self-aware human.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.560]   I don't know if as an athlete, if you need to be, cause you need all systems firing.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   I come from a big family and I think that kind of knowing your place and we're all
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.960]   utility players having an awareness of what's needed at a certain time.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.480]   I think that's part of my upbringing.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.120]   I definitely have trained it through mindfulness training.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.760]   I really love people.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.120]   I really love connecting and I think I'm an empath to a certain extent.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.040]   So I feed off energy.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.560]   So I, I think it's just something that I, it's natural to me.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.120]   And to me, it just pays so many dividends, not only in myself, because I can
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.680]   self-regulate if I'm aware of something happening, but within my relationships,
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.080]   because I can, you know, notice how I'm feeling with my husband.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.360]   If we're having a tough conversation or my husband's having a tough day, I can
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.240]   have awareness about how he's feeling and then I can address it or love him more.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.000]   Whatever it is.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.760]   I think those things are very, very valuable.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.080]   Kind of the emotional IQ part of life to me is, is so undervalued for every top
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.880]   performer, I think it's just a really important thing, especially if you want a
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.560]   long career.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.040]   So I think you got to pay attention to that stuff.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.280]   Are there, are there things to improve it?
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   Some of those things are natural, right?
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.080]   You can't go back in time and have a large family, but what are, what are things
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.320]   you think people can do to improve it?
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.680]   I think just again, I think just developing a practice.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.920]   Well, a knowing who you are is really valuable and being curious about becoming
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.600]   your best self.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.960]   I feel like, I feel like if you're always curious about what the potential you
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.280]   have, then that just makes you like, Oh, okay.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.000]   I just had that.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   I just did.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.760]   That was just an a-hole to that person.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.960]   I want to do that better, you know, kind of living what you don't want shows you
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.200]   what you do want type of thing.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.840]   And that's what self-awareness as well.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.400]   And so I'm always trying to be a better version of myself while loving myself at
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.880]   the same time, even through my flaws.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.600]   And so I feel like that kind of self love component, the curiosity about your innate
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.280]   potential is really important.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.200]   And then I just think like creating space in your life is really important where
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.360]   it's like, if there's a, if you're having a challenging relationship or if there's
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.040]   a challenge in general, if you can like kind of pull yourself outside of it and
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.760]   become the observer of it, which is like Jedi stuff, but so you're not like in the
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.680]   middle of it, but you're like, okay, there's this argument going on, or I'm in
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.280]   this, involved in this argument, like what's behind this, you know, and all
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.840]   these things.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.400]   Like, I just, I feel like getting out of the mud.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.200]   Okay.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:57.720]   A couple of things.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.800]   So I think being curious is really important about yourself, about others.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.520]   Like what's, what's behind this friction.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.200]   I think that that's a thought that makes you not be like, what the fuck?
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.240]   Like, why are you doing this?
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.840]   Okay.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.080]   What like really what's behind this?
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.840]   I'm really curious.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.120]   I really care about these people or this situation.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.200]   So get curious, create some space so that you can actually see what's going on
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.400]   instead of being super emotionally tied to what's going on and then focus on the
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.040]   solution.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.400]   You know, I think these are all things that are based in awareness that will then
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.520]   allow you to have tools to respond appropriately, you know, because there's
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.880]   not one right answer for every situation, even if it's a similar situation all the
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.160]   time.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.320]   So I think giving yourself space, giving yourself a moment, you know, a breath to
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   be in the moment, like one breath, deep breath in and out resets your physiology.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.600]   Like something volleyball that probably relates to this a little bit is that I've
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.440]   been encouraged if I'm feeling like tunnel vision, cause I'm stressed and
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.560]   anxious, it's a big moment.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   I've been encouraged to look off to the horizon because it literally expands my
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.000]   vision and my brain is, oh, okay.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.880]   I'm not in this little fight or flight mode.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.960]   Like I, I have take on the full kaleidoscope of world, which is beautiful.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.840]   And so I think just, just reprogramming yourself so you can be in the moment
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.360]   without anxiety, just knowing that you're equipped to handle whatever's in your way
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.200]   or whatever you're dealing with is a beautiful mindset type of thing.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.960]   So that was all over the place, but it's just space is important.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.440]   Um, awareness is important.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.880]   And then responding mindfully is important.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.720]   And those things don't just happen like on game day.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.280]   Like I train every day like that.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.400]   And I use my training in my personal life too.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   Like in a conversation with my husband, or if a phone call I have to make him
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   1440, I have to go fire somebody.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:36.040]   Like I take my breath before, you know, I think I have my, my preparation, you
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.680]   know, my intention for the, for all these things, I think of what I want the outcome
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.520]   to be and, and then I go.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.240]   So the preparation is everything.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.000]   And then, and then it's all about being in the moment.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.320]   I've done a lot of those things as well.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.160]   So that's really helpful.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.080]   Does it work for you?
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.960]   I mean, for me, there was an interesting conversation I had
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.520]   about kind of distraction.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.640]   There's a guy named near Al wrote a book called indistractable.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.120]   And he says, when you're at this moment where you feel distracted, take a moment
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.480]   and like feel what that, what that is.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.880]   So you can recognize it because a lot of times the reactions you take to things
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.360]   aren't, you're not aware of them until you understand them.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.440]   And once you realize it, like you said, pause in the car and, and, and hear
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.200]   things once you're kind of in the moment, you can course correct, but if you don't
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.320]   pause to understand when that moment happens, it's really hard to course.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.800]   Totally.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.680]   I honestly think being in the moment is the antidote to everything in life.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.880]   Yeah, you did.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.600]   We talked a lot about things you can do in your mind, but when it comes to the
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.560]   body, we started our conversation talking about a mushroom tea and you mentioned
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.800]   you've got a lot of things that you've done and experiments with to optimize.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   I'd love to hear the things that worked, maybe the things that didn't, but the
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.200]   things that have stayed in your routine to help you maybe in that realm.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.360]   Yeah, there's so, there's so many things and they're all like so
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.720]   fundamental and nothing's new.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.640]   So obviously sleep is just a huge, huge priority.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.280]   That's for my, my mental performance, my emotional capabilities and my
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.760]   physical performance, sleep is everything.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.960]   And then nutrition is obviously huge and I, I don't have any specific
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.200]   diet, but I definitely eat very clean.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.840]   I focus on protein a lot.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.960]   I eat a ton of protein.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.080]   I'm a meat eater and I just think my body and my brain needs
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.480]   protein, needs good fat as well.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.200]   So those are my two priorities in my nutrition.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   I just literally, today's day one off of this eight day milk cleanse.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.520]   Cause this is so gross, but I have parasites.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.200]   I have all these pathogens in my tummy and I started gaining weight, but
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.960]   I'm eating really well and sleeping good.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.400]   And I am working out a ton and I was gaining weight in not a good way.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.440]   And I was like, what the hell is going on?
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.840]   And I I've had, I, they're just really hard to get rid of
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.000]   the pathogens in my tummy.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.400]   And so I just drank, I drank six ounces of milk every two hours for
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.240]   12 hours for eight days in a row.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.600]   And that's all I had all day.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.320]   And it was so gnarly, Chris, like by, by day five, I'm like, Oh my God,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.440]   I had lost 10 pounds by, and I needed to.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.840]   So I was stoked on that, but it was probably all waterway, but whatever.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.080]   But I, by the end of the last of this morning, I woke up so proud
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.560]   because I just did something so hard.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.040]   And I think it's so important to do hard things and to push through.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.560]   Cause I almost quit and I almost cheated like a hundred times.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.120]   And my kids saw me doing this.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.240]   My kids would like, I'd make dinner for my whole family.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.360]   And I couldn't eat it and they would just tease me with it.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.480]   So anyhow, so I have been doing the standard process
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.800]   cleanse for over 15 years.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.960]   I do that once a year and that's just to clean out all of my organs.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.840]   Um, to make sure everything's running smoothly by the end of it.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.760]   I feel like a million bucks.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.960]   So I would highly recommend you guys.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.760]   And is that just like a fast or what is that?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.680]   No, you can use as much as you want, but just of what's allowed.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.640]   So no butter, no alcohol, no caffeine, no bread.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.160]   It's a lot of fruits and vegetables and protein, and
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.520]   they give you shakes and pills.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   But it's a, it's a pretty incredible, credible cleanse.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.240]   Cause you're just really eating very cleanly, a very balanced diet.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.840]   And you start to taste food again.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.200]   And you just cut out all this stuff.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.800]   Like I drink a lot of drinks every day and it all adds up.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.880]   You know, even if it's like a holistic tea with some collagen, those are
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.840]   calories and those are, you know, there's it's processed, so that's
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.880]   something I'm very mindful of.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.280]   Um, I partnered with seeking health, which is a supplement
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.760]   company that I am in love with.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.800]   I researched them for over a year before I signed with them because I
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.960]   just a, I want it to work, but I fell in love with their science
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.200]   and with their efficacy.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.280]   So my kids and I, and my husband all use these products and every
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.920]   single person in my journey, ginormous family will be getting seeking
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.680]   health products, um, whether it's vitamin C or, or zinc or vitamin D
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.960]   plus K, um, and their stockings this year.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.280]   So I think that's huge.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   And then also the stuff I do outside of, outside of training, a diverse
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.640]   training, you know, strength training Pilates, I do this.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.600]   I it's called pillar principles.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.400]   I don't even, I don't even how to explain it, but I do a lot of
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.880]   stillness work and, and poses.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.320]   And I try to create space in my body and then I can fill muscle in
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.600]   instead of just packing muscle on this frame that's misaligned.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.360]   So that's something else I do, but the cold plunge is something
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.760]   that I'm 100% in love with.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.640]   I do it probably four days a week for four minutes at a time.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.680]   I will go in the sauna for 45 minutes.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.880]   I get all, I sweat the toxins out.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.560]   I sit there, that's hard as well.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.240]   And then I go straight to the cold plunge, which is at right
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.280]   now it's at 43, 43 degrees.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.000]   I sit in there for about four minutes and then I'm done.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.920]   So all these things are, it's all the elements, but you want the protein,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.560]   you want the fat, you want the cold, you want the heat, you
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.000]   want the resistance training.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.080]   And then I get the exercise in my relationships as far as kind of
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.120]   connection, all these things.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:22.960]   I read a lot.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.560]   So all these things add up to being a high performer.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.480]   In my case, everything is body, mind and spirit, you know?
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.440]   It's funny.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.320]   You mentioned the cold plunge.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.040]   I was talking to my wife about a cold plunge and I was like, what's the.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.200]   What's the hack to do a cold plunge.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.800]   And I was reading these articles about buying a freestanding freezer and
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.280]   like sealing off the joints.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.600]   You can turn a freezer into a cold plunge.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.520]   And it's like, I've done everything.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.520]   And then we found literally it's called the cold plunge.com and it's plugged in.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.000]   I saw it.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.200]   But then I was like, gosh, this freezer version is like $800.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.720]   No, no money.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.560]   Money is one thing, but then you have to buy the ice every single time.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   Like we, we went so far as we had the industrial tub.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.640]   They have, they have in hospitals, we bought an ice machine and we were just so
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.760]   invested, but it was such a pain in the ass because the ice couldn't recycle fast
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.920]   enough for how much we needed and they didn't make enough ice.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.560]   So we've lived so many iterations of this.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.680]   And then we found the cold plunge and it's saving us money.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.720]   It's saving us time.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.480]   It makes it easy.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.320]   And now there's literally no excuse not to do it.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.240]   So I would recommend everyone who's in this life optimization and performance
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.600]   optimization part to go check it out because for the immune benefits, for the
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:34.280]   mental benefits of resiliency and doing hard things and just continually adapting,
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.440]   like it is powerful medicine and it makes it so easy.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.240]   Chris, I'm not even like, I'm not partnering with them like at all.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.200]   I love them.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.960]   So I just, I would check into it.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.800]   And the sauna is next level as well.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.680]   They go hand in hand.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.480]   I'm laughing because the, the, if you pass my future, it's going to be buying one of
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.640]   these, if anyone's seen those meat freezers that they're like five feet, three feet,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.120]   I'm going to go buy a meat freezer.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.160]   I'm going to go seal it off.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.200]   I'm going to fill it with water.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   I'm going to add filtration.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.240]   And for six months, I'm going to be using this like DIY cold plug, and then it's
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.520]   going to break and I'm going to fix it.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.920]   And then eventually I'm going to say, this wasn't worth it.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.960]   Just like the DIY Peloton, I'm going to go buy the real, I'm going to go buy the
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.000]   real thing, which I did there.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.560]   So I just, I like to at least experiment.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.040]   Maybe it's a great solution.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.240]   A lot of DIY things are, but I see for some reason, I'm like predicting my future
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.120]   of, of trying and giving up and doing the real thing.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.280]   We all need to be mindful of the stories we say.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.240]   So if that's the future you want, speak to it.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.880]   But I like that.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.200]   I think it's so it's, it's like rangy, right?
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.120]   It's like the book, like you're developing more range, like creating
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.280]   these experiences for yourself and you'll figure it out.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.000]   If it works, it works.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.320]   If not, it's going to lead you somewhere else.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.880]   But I love that you're just engaged with it.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.040]   That's like everything.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.120]   I'm going to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.800]   You've talked a lot, a few different times about your family and you have three kids.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.000]   You actually, if I remember right, we're pregnant with one of
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.400]   them while winning a gold medal.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.600]   Has having them made it harder to perform or are there times you wish that you
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.840]   were doing one versus the other?
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.360]   And how did you manage that?
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:10.200]   You know, it's what I've always wanted was to be a working mommy period.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.320]   So I know what I signed up for and I would never trade
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.160]   it for the whole wide world.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.120]   It's the best part.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.280]   Having both right.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.760]   Having, having two things.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.800]   My family is up here.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.200]   My, my, my career is very important to me, but it's, it's way down here, but
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.760]   I spend more time in my career, you know?
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.280]   So it's like this crazy yin and yang.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.040]   So no, I, I love both.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.600]   I love both sides of me, both, both sides of my life in that
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.080]   way, make me a better human.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.120]   My kids a hundred percent made me a better athlete, a better
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.640]   partner, more focused, more intentional.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.200]   So my, my kids have helped my career immensely.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.320]   Where it gets hard is the time management is the guilt, all these
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.120]   things, because I thought it was really hard when my kids were infants and
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.440]   actually got to travel the world with them when they were babies on the road.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   But now that they're older, it's like my kids are studs and they have their own
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.560]   lives when I, and I miss, I miss things and that's heartbreaking.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.160]   And so that's the only hard part to me.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.320]   I don't care about being tired.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.240]   I don't care about having to work all day training and then come home and
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.840]   be mommy, make dinner and do homework.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   I love all of that, but I do not have as much time to dedicate to my
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.640]   craft as I normally would watching video and getting body work and all these
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.200]   things, all those things get put on the back burner because I have to prioritize.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.720]   So that's where it gets hard, but I wouldn't want to trade it
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.320]   for all the money in the world.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.440]   It's my favorite thing and it's very hard, but hard isn't bad.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.280]   You know, I was talking to my, my best friend and it's like, we need to
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.960]   reframe the meaning and the vibe behind hard work, like it's like, we all carry
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.320]   it, like it's the biggest burden when it's like, man, I'm so gifted and blessed
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.800]   that I love what I do with all my heart, that I'm willing to suffer so much for
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.200]   it, because that's true love.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.560]   I've suffered in my marriage because I love my man so much.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.560]   I've suffered for my children because I love them so much.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.080]   I suffer for volleyball because I love it so much.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.400]   And so I think that's a blessing.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.080]   And I, I really love working hard.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.520]   Um, and that's why I just think it's so important to have purpose and meaning
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.160]   behind what you're doing, because you're going to suffer either way.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.320]   And if you, if you do have purpose and meaning, then you're going to be able to
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.880]   endure and outlast, and you'll get to where you want to go eventually, no
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.480]   matter what, you know, even if it looks different than what you think it was
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.640]   going to, but if you hate what you do and you have no purpose in meeting, you're
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.520]   suffering, you know, it's like, what's the point make a shift there.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.920]   Not that it's that easy all the time, but it kind of is, you know, like I think we
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.360]   should all be doing things that are meaningful.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.320]   And if you, even if you're custodian, God bless them, if you love it and you like
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.080]   love, but you're supporting your family and you're having these deep relationships
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   with the people you're working with, that's so powerful to me.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.840]   But if you hate every day and you resent it, get rid of it.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.840]   Jordan Peterson is one of my heroes in life.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.520]   And he says, resentment is basically your body and your mind
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.560]   shouting out to speak to something.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.000]   Like something's off here.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.840]   And so, um, yeah, I just wanted to share that.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.040]   Cause that was really powerful to me.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.280]   Cause I, sometimes I feel that I'm like, why am I feeling this?
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.240]   I don't like feeling this way.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.920]   And let me, now I'm going to speak to it.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.800]   I'm going to think about it first.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.000]   You've shared so many lessons.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.600]   Are there lessons that you've learned that you're consciously trying to
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.560]   teach or share with your children?
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:03.080]   All of them really, you know, it's, it's pretty cool being at where I'm at in my
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:03.560]   career.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.000]   Like I'm literally like, I'm it's 50, 50 FM retired or not.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.880]   Like it truly is, which is such a weird place.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.320]   Like I've obviously never been here before, but my children are competing at
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.160]   such a high level for their age group.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.520]   And I get to witness them like striving and falling short and training certain
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.760]   things.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.920]   Like my husband took my son's Sundance to the rec center this morning at 6 45 to
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.880]   go work on dribbling.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.040]   That's commitment and that's family connection.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   It's like everything that's so special in life.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.720]   Anyhow, but when I watch my kids compete, like it's just reinforces the things that
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.640]   I know are important for me to be a high performer.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.560]   Like make, if my kids get second or third in a race and they're devastated and they
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.760]   feel shame about losing my beam, that was incredible.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.640]   You tried your best.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.440]   What could you do better?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.360]   But babe, that was just a rep at doing something very hard.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.160]   And you're going to take this rep with you when you go next.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   If you miss that lamp, babe, don't worry about it.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.280]   If you get punched, like this is going to make you so good.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.800]   You know, the hard stuff makes you so good because it fortifies you, but you have to
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.400]   have that mindset that this is here to serve me.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.640]   And one of my founding principles is that everything in my life is here to serve me
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.960]   and all the hell I've had in my life has been in my own making because of choices
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:14.120]   or, or poor thinking or taking things for granted or over obsession.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.920]   And I learned through all these things because it's there to serve me and it's
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.160]   there to help my soul grow.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.600]   And yeah, I love learning from my children.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.080]   They're little, little students.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.840]   And mostly it's, I feel like the, the call for all of us, especially this day and age
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.040]   is to, to treat ourselves how we would treat our best friend or to treat our
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.560]   children.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.400]   If we F up, if we have a bad day, if we're in a hole, like, how would you speak to
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.360]   your child about that?
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.480]   And not, it's not baby talk, but it's just like, you're never going to lay the
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.200]   hammer on them.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.040]   Like you can be strict and you can be, you know, like have conviction, but it
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.080]   doesn't mean being a hole.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.880]   And so I'm really trying to love myself and love my children in the same way.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.200]   So we can all grow and really holistic, healthy ways that center around like
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.320]   self-sourcing confidence, self-sourcing, happiness, self-sourcing, the feeling of
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:01.600]   success and satisfaction and not waiting for anyone, anything or anyone outside of
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.720]   us to save the day or to make us be happy or to make us feel accomplished.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.720]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.480]   Are they all following the footsteps in sports?
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.640]   They're all little ballers.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.480]   That's for sure.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.120]   They're so cute, but they also, they're just, they're way more, they're more
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   rangy than me.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.080]   They like, they re they read and they write.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.400]   And my son, son, it says piano and Joey, like as a love, he's a craftsman doing
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.520]   these things and scouting my daughters and artists.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.600]   It's so cool.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.440]   The access these kids have today.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.880]   And my husband's very, very good about getting the kids out of the house, about
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.360]   introducing them to new things.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.080]   And we just see what sticks and we follow their curiosity and what lights them up.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.240]   And it's really beautiful.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.880]   I'm, I'm so excited.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:44.040]   You know, we have one daughter and she's 16 months and she's just starting.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.360]   We're like, well, let's go to the library.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.160]   Let's go to the zoo.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.680]   Like you start to recognize things.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.920]   So it's, it's really exciting to get them out and show them the world and.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.640]   And all of the things that there are all over the place.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.160]   Chris and the relationship for a dad and their children is just, I just witnessed
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:58.680]   this so much.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.960]   I mean, it's obviously the mommy is sacred and it's so special, but daddies and
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:07.120]   daughters, daddies and sons is just such a, an essential relationship.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.760]   And it's just, I'm so excited for you to create that with your daughter, because
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.520]   I've said, well, my, when my husband's not around, my kids are different.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.040]   Not that I'm not enough, but it's like they, they, they need both partners.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.360]   And it's, it's so, it's such a beautiful thing when a daddy is a great father.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.120]   I'm trying my best.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.560]   That changes, that changes lives.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.800]   My, I remember the first time I realized my dad believed in me, it changed my whole
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.080]   life.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.200]   Like I'm going to cry.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.680]   It literally, that's why I'm doing this today because of that one day playing
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.760]   horse against my brother and our best friend who were so good at basketball.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.120]   And he, he put his money on me and I swear to God, it changed my whole life,
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.240]   Chris, like crazy.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:48.280]   So that's the power of a mentor or a parent or a loved one believing in you.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.080]   And that takes the same kind of presence that we talked about earlier to be there
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.880]   for, for those moments that believe in you.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.640]   And you don't need to be perfect.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.440]   You just need to be there.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.560]   You're sincerely like sincerity is magic as well.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.960]   It covers up all sorts of sins.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.160]   Covers up all sorts of perfection because you're there sincerely.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.800]   You're not trying to be or do or, you know, anything that you're not.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.920]   It's awesome.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.960]   Getting the crew together.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.520]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   I get it.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.520]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.840]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.920]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:28.800]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.320]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.400]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.240]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.640]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.600]   want to celebrate that you got through another week with Drizzly, you can make
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.880]   hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means you can
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.720]   entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.200]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.880]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.880]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.840]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.920]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.840]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.200]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.280]   When your projects get more complex, finding what you're looking for across
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.640]   your entire workspace gets so much harder.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   That's where Notion Q&A comes in.

[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:06.560]   So part of this podcast, there's a deep-rooted kind of love for travel.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.480]   And I want to go somewhere interesting.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.240]   I looked online and you've played 149 tournaments outside of the US, which
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.880]   means in, by my count, 29 countries.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.360]   Any hacks from all these travel, like what you do when you travel to make it
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.520]   more enjoyable other than upgrades?
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.040]   Yeah, upgrades, number one.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.680]   I definitely bring a lot of hydration.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.600]   I think the water they give, I just, I'm not a big fan of the
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.920]   food or anything on airplanes.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.480]   Thank goodness for it, but I'm not a big fan.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.800]   So I, I source my own food, my own water.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:38.440]   I always bring a lacrosse ball or a softball to put in my back.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   It's like, we all get back problems where we're sitting down on my hips and that
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.320]   kind of is a distraction for my body and it helps relieve some pain and pressure.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.240]   And to me, I can't travel without it.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.120]   I'll roll my feet out.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.760]   I'll roll my back and people think I'm weird, but it's like, I need it.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.720]   Um, there's these devices called Firefly, uh, recovery devices.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.760]   And basically it's this little device that you wrap around your knee and it's
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.240]   a pressure point that helps flush, like, you know, how we all get cankles when we
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.320]   fly, so it helps flush the circulation.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.960]   So a, and, and it has a little vibration.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.640]   So you feel that distraction and then you, you know, keep your circulation
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.200]   going, which to me is really important.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.280]   It was, it was so cool.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.240]   These things, Firefly was developed for people who have surgery, like
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.200]   leg surgery, and they have a lot of swelling and it just
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.640]   helps the recovery process.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.840]   So a lot of athletes do this after big matches, long days, they
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.960]   put this device on them and it helps them recover.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.720]   I've brought 10 tens units, a stem machine.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.960]   I've bought that.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.680]   I like, if you're miserable, you're going to try to find a way to alleviate pain.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.360]   And that was a huge one for me.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.000]   That was a really, really good one for me.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.880]   So just stuff like that.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.800]   I bring always a good book.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.520]   Make sure I have my, my charger, have all the essentials done.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.080]   Cause I'll panic if my phone dies.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   Stuff like that, the pillow.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:52.080]   Any, any, any place that you just love to go that you, you take,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.280]   you plan repeat trips to?
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.440]   I rarely traveled for enjoyment.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.480]   It's always been on the circuit.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.440]   So we always go once a year, we go to Stade Switzerland, which is one of my
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.840]   favorite towns in the whole wide world.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.560]   It's at the base of the Alps, cobblestone streets, just a
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.800]   typical, beautiful Swiss village.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.120]   Love it there.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.920]   You should go there free on your miles.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.480]   They have one of the most amazing hotels called the Alpine.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.920]   That has, it makes, it puts no boot to shame their sushi restaurant.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.840]   It's incredible.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:22.360]   And then I love Paris with all my heart, but yeah, we've gotten to
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.840]   some really remarkable places.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.760]   I'm more of a European traveler than an Asian traveler, even though I had
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.400]   really great experiences in Asia.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.280]   I just, I have more of a, I think I'm more comfortable over there.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.160]   I hope you get to, I don't want to push off retirement, especially
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:40.080]   knowing how much you love Paris coming up in a few years, but I hope that
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.800]   whenever that day comes, you get to start traveling more for fun.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.040]   Thank you.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.000]   I it's, it's part of the, it's part of the vision board.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.120]   I'm a very big believer in vision boards and you got to see it.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.960]   You got to see it to bring it into your life and your experience and travel
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.440]   is one of my loves for sure.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.800]   I just, I want it with my family more often than not.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.640]   Like when my kids, you know, get older, I can't wait to travel with my husband.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.400]   Traveling is just such a beautiful gift.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:00.800]   It's funny.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.440]   We we've talked about your retirement, but you started a company.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.400]   And so it's funny that even if you stopped playing volleyball,
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.480]   you're not stopping working.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:16.240]   I mean, it's funny because you you're a pro athlete.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.600]   You talked about how you didn't have enough time to balance work on the,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.240]   on the court and your family, and yet you started a company.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.280]   What inspired you to take one other huge thing on in your life
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.160]   with with almost no free time?
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.640]   Well, as with everything in my life, the team, it makes everything possible.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.920]   This is not a solo mission.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.280]   Otherwise, this would have lasted maybe half a day
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.520]   because being an entrepreneur, as you know, is as gnarly as it gets.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.040]   It makes being an Olympian like a walk in the park.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.760]   Like as far as I'm concerned, you know, being an athlete, like I just love
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.880]   that I live and die based on my own results being an entrepreneur.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.560]   There's so many more variables, different people's timelines
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.360]   and all these things.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.640]   So I really have a lot of respect for the entrepreneurs out there.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.000]   A lot of the things that are required to be a great athlete
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   are required to be a great entrepreneur, which I really respect.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.360]   So I have good training there.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.680]   Sport has given me everything in my life.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.560]   It gave me my husband.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.800]   I've been all around the world.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.040]   I got a college scholarship.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.160]   I've learned so many valuable life lessons.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.480]   And so I really want to leave the sport better than when I showed up.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.960]   And the sport of volleyball is so underserved, as we talked about before,
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.440]   not just in prize money and people's ability to earn, but just just in growth
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.320]   and the way the market responds to us, there's huge opportunity there.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.560]   And so within 1440, we're just here to serve the community
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.720]   that is very hungry, that is very underserved, that is very deserving.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   You know, so we have two sides of us.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.200]   We have our event side where we allow where we create opportunities
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.160]   where these kids can compete at events.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.120]   We just started this year where at the end of our six event series,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.440]   it's called the Futures Tour.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.600]   The top 40 points earners are going to earn over one hundred
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.160]   and ten thousand dollars to go toward their club fees
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.880]   and toward their pursuit of a college scholarship.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.160]   So we love that we're using that pain point because it's a really expensive
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.280]   proposition to be a club sport athlete these days.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.920]   So the Futures Tour is allowing us to give back so they get to compete
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.360]   at a high level and then earn prize money to go toward subsidizing their futures,
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.200]   which is beautiful.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.120]   And then we have a digital program side of us where it's all about health
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.160]   and wellness and volleyball, and so we can train you in all sorts of things.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.160]   So it's pretty powerful.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.240]   I'm honored to do it.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.320]   It's a really hard job than I like.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.240]   I'm in this chair most days on zoom calls all day and sending emails.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.600]   And that's actually another driver for me not to retire yet,
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.040]   because this is this is a different kind of hard and I'm out of practice with it.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.400]   And it's not my favorite.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.760]   But the community we're growing and building and the impact we're having
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.800]   and we continue to grow into it makes it worth it.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.120]   So I'm willing to be uncomfortable for those things I love,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.480]   like I mentioned before, but this is this is just crazy.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.880]   Yeah, I've started companies and it is a lot of work.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.480]   Are there specific things that you have learned as an athlete
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.440]   that you think people listening to this in business would benefit from learning
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.680]   that you've applied running the company?
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.520]   Well, all of it, really.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.920]   I mean, just consistency, you know, that we are our habits.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.000]   So make sure your habits are on point.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.880]   I really one of the first lessons I learned through our investor,
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.080]   who's incredible, her name's Teresa, is that every time we have a board
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.680]   call or a financial call, like she tackles the hardest thing first,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.320]   like money makes me really uncomfortable, right?
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.400]   It like makes me scream.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.800]   And on every call I've ever been on, when money is involved,
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.880]   usually happens at the end.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.920]   And we're all dreading this call for on here for an hour.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.680]   And at the end, we get to the nitty gritty.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.560]   She tackles the hardest thing first.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.000]   And it changes everything.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.200]   And it allows for so much more freedom and engagement.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.160]   And to me, that was very, very powerful.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.440]   When you're on it, when you're on a phone call, just address
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.600]   what needs to be addressed candidly,
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.480]   you know, respectfully, and just get the hard part over with first.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.760]   I think the importance of resilience, that resilience is a choice.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.400]   Resilience is a mindset is really, really important,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.800]   because as we all know, as in life and being an entrepreneur,
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.880]   you're going to take hits you never saw coming.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.360]   You're going to stumble, you know, kind of risks you took are not going to pan out.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.640]   And so you have to be resilient.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   You have to be nimble.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.720]   Let's know what your goal is, but be very flexible in getting there.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.840]   That's been a theme in my career, for sure, because nothing is linear.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.360]   Leaning on your teammates, having hard conversations,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.240]   getting dirty with the things you know, don't like if you have an idea,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.040]   like see it through execution, don't just throw your idea to your team
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.760]   and expect it to come out the end where you want it to be.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   They got to stick with the process type of thing.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.520]   So all these beautiful things, it's really, really important.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.560]   And then just I really believe that so much in life, everything in life is energy.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.240]   And so much of the success and satisfaction in life comes from a mindset.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.920]   And so one of my favorite quotes is it's not the weight you carry,
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.600]   it's the way you carry it.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.040]   And so as we go through hard things in business and the you know,
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.560]   it's like we keep being overloaded
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.320]   with all this weight and stress and burdens and challenges.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.960]   It's like, how are you going to carry your weight?
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.160]   Are you going to carry it like it's heavy?
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.640]   Are you going to carry it like you got it?
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.360]   You know, and that's kind of metaphorical, like with your thinking,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.000]   with your emotional state, with your physicality, like I got this.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.760]   That mentality is really, really important, obviously,
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.600]   when you're an entrepreneur, because you have to find a way.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.680]   It's your job, you know?
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.960]   Yeah. Yeah. It's literally I've had moments where it's like
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.320]   there's no person above you, like you have to solve the problem.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.800]   Like in so many parts of life, if you're you could pass it on
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.560]   or you can get advice.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.480]   But like at the end of the day, you're like, I don't have a choice.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   I have to solve this problem. It has to be done.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.080]   Yeah. And I'm jealous of all the training you had solving difficult things
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.800]   before you jumped into entrepreneurship.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.600]   And I'm excited to see what the future entails.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.360]   And I've had the fortunate benefit of being able to see some,
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.480]   you know, live beach volleyball games, which I think,
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.800]   you know, Trump's seen it on TV.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.880]   I hope some of the tours you guys are putting on are in places
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.080]   that people listening get a chance to go see it, because you know,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.680]   you said it's the number one sport in the Olympics.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.800]   Seen it in person is next level.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.960]   It is next level. Yeah, it's it's such a big fun party.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.080]   It's so inspiring.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.360]   I think it's like I said earlier, like encouragement is so important.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.560]   I think it's so important just to create like moments of inspiration in your days
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.520]   and to seek out the inspiration in your life.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.040]   And like the sport of volleyball is one thing like I love watching the Warriors.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.400]   I love beautiful art.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.960]   Like I just I think it's upon each of ourselves to curate our life
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.920]   experience and our environments and what we introduce into our lives.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.440]   And yeah, choosing, inspiring, encouraging things are beautiful.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.000]   Yeah, I think I've shared this before, but I'll share it with you.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.480]   One thing that I started doing was I created a spreadsheet.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.720]   And every month I have to do some memorable, inspiring experience.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.160]   And usually it just I'm fortunate that something happens.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.320]   And I'm like, great, it happened.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.640]   But it's come the 25th of the month.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.040]   If there's nothing, I'm like, we got to go do something.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.800]   Like whether it's a new museum, whether it's a show, whether it has to be
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   something we can't have done it before.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.400]   It has to be something that we wouldn't just regularly do.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.520]   And so I have this list from 2015 of all of the things that happened each month.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.640]   There were a few months during Covid where there just wasn't a thing.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   And I was like, I have the choice of trying to make something up and say,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.120]   oh, we did this little thing.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.280]   And so I just took the L and said, for these three months, we just did nothing.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.240]   And I failed for those are.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.280]   You're forgiven.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.960]   Yeah. But but going forward, it's coming back.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.600]   And each month it's let's do something memorable because my
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.320]   I can't remember where this came from, but I couldn't imagine a world
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.680]   where you look back and there was a month long period of your life
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.800]   where there was nothing memorable that happened.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.640]   And so I started documenting, making sure that something happened.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.520]   And it's been really awesome to do.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.760]   That's incredible.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.800]   What a great suggestion for all of us.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.400]   You're so right.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.200]   Like we're just all automatons and just walking through life.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.920]   And I know we have high moments and low moments in every day,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.280]   but like creating memories.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.920]   And that to me is like the power of intention and commitment.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.160]   You committed to it and you and your enthusiasm when you spoke about it.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.880]   Like, that's awesome.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.520]   I think it's really powerful. Good work.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.880]   It's not hard. It's just do something new and fun.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.280]   It doesn't have to be expensive.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.160]   So I encourage everyone to do that.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.040]   Commit to it.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:52.720]   Commit, you commit.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.160]   The decision is the most important part of the journey, right?
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.640]   Once you commit, don't hedge your bets, like go.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.200]   Well, this has been fantastic.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.120]   Before we go, where can people follow what you're doing?
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.520]   Find out what you decide in June
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.360]   and kind of track you along the way.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.080]   I would be greatly honored if people could follow at Platform 1440
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.520]   across all social channels.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.600]   I am at Carolee Walsh across all social channels.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   P1440.com is really important.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.600]   Yeah, we're going to have some new digital program coming out.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.360]   Programs coming out early in early in the year 2022, which is madness for 1440.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.440]   That's all centered on resetting.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.280]   And just it's like an initiation, like starting your year of powerfully
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.840]   and getting rid of the baggage so you can create the 2022 of your dreams.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.680]   And it's all centered on body, mind and spirit.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.000]   I really like that trifecta.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.320]   So you'll get some strength training, some agility training,
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.600]   some mindfulness training and some nutrition as well.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.400]   So all that stuff is really fun for me to share.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.480]   So I encourage everyone to check that, check that out.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.200]   But no, but thank you for this, Chris.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.960]   This was really fun.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   I'm really proud of you.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.760]   I'm very excited that your success makes sense
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.240]   with your podcast for the way you lead a conversation. Great job.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.920]   Yeah. Thank you so much for being here.

[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.240]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.400]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.520]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.520]   Especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.600]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me or just want to say hi,
