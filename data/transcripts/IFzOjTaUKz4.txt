[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.180]   Pastor John, this weekend we will be celebrating Resurrection Sunday. In a
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.540]   nutshell, what is the significance of Easter? Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.380]   came into the world from the Father, born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, did
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.340]   wonderful miracles, loved people, blew all of our categories, nevertheless was
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.220]   crucified for our sins. And then on the third day, and this is Easter,
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.500]   the celebration of that Sunday, He was raised from the dead, never to die again.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.460]   And Luke tells us, having done all of his historical research, that He, for 40 days,
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.980]   gave many infallible proofs. And Paul himself, who was a kind of Johnny-come-lately
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.860]   to the Apostles, said that when he wrote 1 Corinthians, 500 people had
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.620]   seen Him alive, and some of those are still alive, if you want to go talk to
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.420]   them. That's the kind of historical control they had. He was raised physically,
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.140]   they recognized Him, they could put their hands in His wounds, He ate fish in front
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.500]   of them, precisely to say, "A spirit, a ghost, doesn't have flesh and bones, as you
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.620]   see that I have." He was more than physical, because He seemed to go and
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.260]   come at will. Doors didn't--locked doors didn't get in His way, so there's this
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.260]   unusual new dimension to His body. He ascended to the right hand of the
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.260]   Father, He sits on the throne with God, He intercedes for us there, praying for
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:51.900]   His people every day, He's reigning until He puts all of His enemies under His feet.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.300]   The end of Matthew says He has all authority in heaven and on earth, He'll
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.220]   never die again, He has the keys of death and hell in His hands. For starters,
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   Tony, that's what happened. And the question then--let me just add
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.260]   this--the question then is, so what's the implication of that stunning claim and
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.620]   reality for us? And I would say, one, it means my sins are forgotten, because Paul
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.260]   said in 1 Corinthians 15, "If Christ is not raised, we're still in our sins,"
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.340]   implying if He is raised, our sin problem is over. And that's because
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.820]   the Resurrection vindicates the event of Good Friday, namely His death. This
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.380]   death really did cover the sins of His people, it really did provide a perfect
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.380]   righteousness for us, so that it says in, I think, the end of Romans 4 that He
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.940]   was delivered up, that is, to the cross, because of our trespasses, and He was
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.340]   raised up because of our justification, meaning just as our sin brought into the
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.460]   cross, the finished work of taking care of our sins brought Him out of the grave.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.620]   God looked down and said, "Oh, my son's work was perfect. He's not staying in the
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.220]   grave, and He raises Him from the dead to vindicate all that He had accomplished
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.460]   for us." So in a sense, you could say, practically, Easter means every day that
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:37.740]   the promises of God for me, to help me, every minute of my life, are secured by
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.860]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ, because the Resurrection vindicates the cross
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:49.340]   where those promises were bought for me. And then, maybe I should add, at the end
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:59.060]   of my life, Philippians 3, 20-21, says, "He's going to give me a body when I die, and
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.660]   I'm raised from the dead, a body like His glorious body." So that the body of Jesus,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.220]   with which He came from the dead, is a forerunner, it's a first
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.500]   fruit, it's a kind of paradigm of the way all of His people who trust Him are going
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.220]   to have new bodies someday. And then, as if that were not great enough, Romans 8
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.180]   says that when the freedom of the glory of the children of God comes to
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.700]   pass, and they are raised from the dead and given glorified bodies, the whole
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:41.420]   creation gets made over as a suitable galactic playground for those of us
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.300]   who have been given bodies that will never sin again, never get sick again, all
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.580]   tears wiped away. So I would say, Tony, that the implications of Easter are
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.620]   simply staggering. They are personally precious for every day's
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.420]   life of struggle, and they are globally and galactically precious, because the
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.660]   Resurrection guarantees that this whole created order is going to be made new.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.620]   So everything hinges on the reality of the Resurrection. That's exactly
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.820]   the reasoning of 1 Corinthians 15, 17, following. If Christ has not been
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.180]   raised, our Gospel is in vain, your faith is in vain, we are found to be preaching
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.100]   a false gospel, we might as well eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.980]   Paul put all of his eggs in that basket. If that didn't happen physically, bodily,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.460]   permanently, then Christianity is just a sham. We may as well pack it up and just
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.340]   be gluttons the rest of our lives. The stakes are very high. Thank you, Pastor
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.420]   John. For more details about the life of Christ, consider picking up Pastor John's
