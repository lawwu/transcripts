[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   Last summer, back when we could gather in large auditoriums, about 2,200 APJ listeners
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480]   gathered together in one room in Nashville.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.860]   It was a wonderful time together, and there we recorded a handful of live episodes, including
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.500]   the following one intended for evangelical believers on a very perplexing trend that
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880]   resurfaces every June.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.440]   Here's the clip.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.700]   So-called same-sex marriage has never been more popular in America, and whatever garners
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.520]   cultural popularity seeps into the church, you know this.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.280]   According to the Pew Research Center, among white evangelicals in America, 29% now "favor
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.140]   29% of white American evangelicals.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.480]   That's up from 11% just 15 years ago.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.180]   So that's a long and steady increase in a rise in affirmation among white evangelicals
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.980]   in America, up from 11% to 29% affirming of same-sex, so-called same-sex marriage in 15
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.980]   years.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980]   Bill, who is here with us this morning, asks, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.600]   As the LGBT movement strives to become mainstream, I've watched more and more believers give
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.080]   into the culture by posting rainbow-colored affirmations on social media, hanging rainbow
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.160]   flags outside their homes, and even attending pride rallies in my city.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.060]   I want to believe the best, but I am perplexed.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.780]   How should we respond to fellow believers who make such affirmations?"
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.900]   How you respond directly depends on your relationship, but let me hold that for a minute.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.580]   Like it might be your wife, right?
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.140]   It might be your son.
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.360]   Like your wife decides so-called gay marriage is okay.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.980]   Now what?
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.580]   Or your child does.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.940]   So how you do relationships depends on the relationship that exists.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.500]   Let's back up from there.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:17.460]   The first response should be to go to the Bible and solidify what God says about homosexuality
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.260]   and the practice of it.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.960]   And what he says in 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10 is that those who do such things will not
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.540]   enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.260]   And there are other texts that are significantly powerful as well.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.340]   That's terrifying.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.220]   And then the second thing you should do after solidifying that that's in the Bible is decide
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.260]   whether you're going to believe the Bible.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.820]   That's no small thing today.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.580]   You know, Desiring God, we stepped back recently to ask what are we really about?
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.940]   What are our 10 big things that we would like to see true in 10 years?
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.140]   And you know what the first one is?
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.740]   You were part of it.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.540]   The first one is we would like to be known as a ministry in 10 years that is unashamed
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.460]   of everything in the Bible.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:19.340]   So we say it like that.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.180]   Probably nobody would have thought to say it like that 50 years ago.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.480]   They probably would have said 50 years ago, "We want to be known as standing for what's
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.820]   in the Bible," or something like that, which is great.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.940]   But the reason that feels like the way it needs to be said is because the people who
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:45.180]   are caving on social issues like this one are caving because they're ashamed of what
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.540]   the Bible says.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540]   They're embarrassed by it.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.620]   It looks to the world like hate speech or like Neanderthal ethics.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.340]   And if you don't have your roots very deep in God, very deep in the Bible so that what
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.500]   the world presses in on is not controlling you, you're going to cave.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.180]   And so the second response is not just know what's in the book, but get on your face,
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.780]   you know, like Billy Graham up in the hills of California wondering if he could preach
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.940]   this whole book and just saying, "God, either I can or I can't.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.940]   If I can, I will.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.940]   If I can't, I won't.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940]   I'm not a waffler.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.580]   I'm not going to hang in the middle here and try to pretend I'm a Christian saying the
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.540]   Bible is true and then go off and just tell what the world tells."
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.140]   So that's a big crisis that all of you in this room will or should have had, and I hope
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:57.460]   you come out on the side of courage that, "I want to stand with this book."
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.340]   And then the question arrives, "Okay, I've got my position.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.340]   I love it.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.340]   I believe God loves us.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.260]   I believe God loves people who wrestle with homosexuality, and I want to be a loving person.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.980]   Now what will love look like?"
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.900]   Because I believe, like I said last night, that singing in the jail and loving the jailor
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.100]   – and he may be a gay jailor – that's what you're called to do.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.260]   That's what it is to be a Christian, is to trust God, sing in the prison, and love
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.980]   the jailor no matter what.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.820]   And what will love look like?
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.100]   And you don't listen to the world.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.460]   To let the world tell you what love is, you go to the Bible.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.380]   What does love do?
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.140]   You know, I just read this morning in Devotion – let me show you.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.860]   It says, "Those who hate a rebuke don't love themselves."
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.700]   That's a lousy paraphrase, but the idea was that if you hate knowledge, you hate yourself.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.460]   Well, most people don't think that way.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.020]   Most people think, "No, I'm loving myself if I avoid rebukes.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.620]   If I tell my wife, 'Stop rebuking me like that!
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.940]   I'm not feeling built up!'"
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.860]   She would have every right to say, "Read your Bible."
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.140]   So what love is, is defined by God, not by the world.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.100]   And love will surely try to keep people out of hell.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.240]   If you don't believe in hell, you might as well close up your book.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.940]   Love will do anything biblically to keep people out of hell.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.660]   And that means telling the truth with love, with warnings, with pleadings, with prayers.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.620]   So now we're at the point of relationships, and that's probably where the rubber meets
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.740]   the road.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.820]   So if you're married, and this happens, one spouse begins to just be swayed by some
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:06.300]   very foolish things, and she or he may decide, "No, I think the loving thing is to attend
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:16.100]   that marriage and to support them and to affirm the rightness of that so-called gay marriage."
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.340]   What do you do?
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.740]   And the clearest answer is, you do not divorce.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.540]   So there you are in a relationship till death do us part with somebody who believes a doctrine
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.660]   that sends people to hell, which will make things very awkward.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:46.980]   And there's nothing you can do about it except pray, have one or two good, knock-down, drag-out
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:54.820]   levels of theological argument, and then look at each other and say, "We've got to make
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.460]   this work, honey," and then you work it out.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.420]   Then you move out from there to your kids.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.060]   That'll happen too.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.060]   What do you do?
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.060]   What do you do if they're teenagers?
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.540]   What do you do if they're grownups?
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.260]   And the answer is, you have those conversations.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.940]   You have them as peacefully and as level-headedly and as prayerfully and as tenderly and wisely
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:20.340]   as you can, and then you find ways to relate.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.980]   This would apply to close friendships as well, I think, adult children.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:32.220]   You find ways to relate that do not treat the issue as though it were a small thing,
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.660]   but you don't pester.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:42.660]   You find ways to navigate the relationships that rejoice in what is truly good and are
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.940]   seriously sad and what is truly sad, and they know where you stand, and you know where they
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:55.700]   stand, and if they're willing, you do things together in a loving way.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.900]   They're your kids.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.340]   What can you do?
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.420]   Or church member.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.980]   Your pastor, church member, affirms so-called gay marriage.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.980]   Now what?
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.820]   Well, that'll depend on your documents, won't it?
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.620]   I mean, get yourself sued, which is okay if you're doing the right thing, but you need
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.180]   to have in place documents that say what membership involves in these regards.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.180]   We had to…
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:30.020]   There was nothing in our documents 40 years ago that helped us navigate these things,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.260]   but now there are, so that's another one.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:41.620]   And so in general, the answer is love will look different in different situations.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.180]   Excommunication from the church is not unloving.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:52.580]   Don't ever let anybody tell you that church discipline is an unloving thing.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:10:01.420]   So adjust the form of love to the particularity of the relationship and stand your ground.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.380]   Thank you, Pastor Jon.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.820]   Thank you, Pastor Jon.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.540]   That was the final excerpt from our APJ Live session recorded in Nashville last summer.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.340]   I look forward to doing this again someday.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.020]   Maybe we'll do this again when we can all gather in one place.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.380]   Thank you for listening.

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:43.220]   Well, Jesus told us to bind and loose, but is this practice relevant for the church today?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.700]   We'll find out when we return on Friday.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.580]   We'll see you then.
