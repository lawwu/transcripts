[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   The way I conceptualize the idea of fasting, obviously this is one where we need more words,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   right?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.640]   Because the word fasting is so limited, there's so many different parts of this, but…
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.440]   Skipping breakfast for me would be that, or skipping dinner.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   Right.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.000]   Sometimes I'll skip dinner, sometimes I'll skip breakfast.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Right.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.840]   I think that some of the most interesting data that I've seen has been about if we
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.000]   reasonably compress our eating into daytime hours during the part of the diurnal cycle
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.160]   when we are supposed to be eating.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.080]   So essentially matching our chronobiology with our behavior, which, you know, we are
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   diurnal organisms, so we kind of need to respect that.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   Like when we do that and we compress it in a moderate way, our metabolic health is better.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.720]   And so some of the studies that have looked at this, one that was interesting was, and
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.560]   I think very hopeful for people, is that if you take all the food, all the calories that
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.120]   you're going to eat, and eat them in a 6-hour window versus a 12-hour window, totally same
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.800]   amount of calories, exact same food.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.620]   This is a controlled experiment.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.000]   People who eat the same amount of calories in a 6-hour period are going to have much
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   lower, statistically significantly lower, glucose, 24-hour glucose and insulin levels
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.640]   compared to people who just space it out over the course of a 12-hour period.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.560]   And it makes sense because if you're spacing that food out over the course of 12 hours,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   that is a different biochemical milieu in your body throughout the day.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.600]   It's kind of similar to the walking.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   You know, it's like you are then stimulating insulin several more times.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.920]   You are exposing the bloodstream to insulin and glucose just more throughout the day.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.160]   And giving the bloodstream less of an opportunity to just sort of be clear from that glucose
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.380]   and that insulin.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.760]   And so compressing our eating window seems to be helpful for metabolic health.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   And it's a bang for your buck, right?
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.800]   Like you can eat the same amount of food.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.480]   You just have to eat in a shorter period of time.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.520]   So for people who want to eat, you know, a lot, maybe just consider compressing it into
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.160]   daytime hours, 6- to 8-hour window.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   For me, 6 is tough.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   6 is tough, yeah.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   The one meal per day thing is tough.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.480]   I have friends like Lex Freedman that do the one meal per day thing.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800]   I end up eating so much food at that meal that I experience a lot of kind of like mechanical
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280]   distress as typically later in the day.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.380]   I think an 8- to 10-hour window has worked well for me most days.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.320]   I know as soon as we talk about intermittent fasting, which is what, or time-restricted
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   feeding, same thing, which is what we're talking about right now, I'm sure somebody is going
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   to call up the, there's been a study that's been circulating about a massive increase
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000]   in cardiovascular risk in people doing intermittent fasting and particularly the 6-hour feeding
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   window.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I just want to point out.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Worst study.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.440]   As far as I know, I could be wrong, but as far as I know, that study is still in abstract
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   form.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   It's not yet peer-reviewed.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.480]   It's like the fact that studies that haven't been peer-reviewed aren't even close to being
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   peer-reviewed are being like put out there as new stories is really problematic because
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.480]   I can tell you as somebody who sat on the editorial boards of many journals for many
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.240]   years, I still sit on a few, reviewed countless papers, I've submitted and had to deal with
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   reviews on countless papers, the fact of the matter is like until the reviews are done,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.720]   the revisions are made, like that paper may never see the light of day and it may end
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.020]   up in a journal that you, is barely worthy of a placemat.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.800]   It might end up in a high-tier, high-quality journal, but it might not.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.640]   So just because there was "a study done" means very little, but it means especially
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   little, maybe nothing until it's peer-reviewed.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   Absolutely.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.080]   And the methods were very poor in that study.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.240]   It was a recall-based study, I think, for two days of recall of people's diets, which
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.200]   is notoriously very bad in terms of accuracy.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.920]   So yeah, and I think I'm not in any way suggesting that a six-hour window is the optimal window.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.840]   I'm just sharing the data that suggests that compressing the window seems to have a favorable
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.560]   effect, and I certainly don't do six hours, but I think when you look at what the average
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:20.400]   American is doing, which is the average American has 11 eating events per day and 50% of Americans
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.040]   eat over a 15-hour window per day.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.120]   I can recall those because I remember when I was writing the book, I was like, "That's
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.920]   a long time, 15 hours and 11 events," and every time you're doing that, you're going
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   to be stimulating this glucose rise in the bloodstream, exposing the blood vessels to
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   that glucose.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.760]   You're going to be turning on all the pathways with insulin to basically store it, and so
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.840]   it's strain for the body.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.200]   And so I think giving the body times intentionally to allow insulin to come down and to allow
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.880]   glucose to come down, what that does is it generates metabolic flexibility.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.440]   It gives our body an opportunity to have space to use accessible glucose and then convert
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.160]   into using stored fat, and that ultimately is metabolic flexibility, the ability for
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.320]   the body, giving the body opportunities to use glucose but then have times when there's
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.080]   not high glucose and insulin around to actually get into the fat stores.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.760]   And I think one of the reasons why we have such a massive overweight and obesity rates
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.200]   in the country is because with the way the culture of eating right now, 11 eating events
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.160]   per day, eating over the course of 15 hours per day, I would imagine the average American
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.520]   body is rarely, if ever, tapping into their fat stores for energy in a meaningful way
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   because we always have glucose available to the body.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.680]   If you think about, again, the stats about ultra-processed food, about 70% of the items
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.920]   on the shelves in the grocery store are ultra-processed food, and those ultra-processed foods are
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.880]   built on refined added sugars and refined added grains.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.840]   So we're just – we very rarely give the body the opportunity to rest and move into
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   fat burning.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.800]   And that's where compressing the eating window can be valuable.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.560]   Obviously, people have talked about this before, but fasting can be a stressor for the body,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.680]   especially if your body is not used to using fat for energy.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.880]   And so it's something to ease into and go slow.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.920]   But I think if you're slowing down enough to really hear what your body's signal
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.880]   are saying, you can kind of know whether I think your fasting is working for you or not.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   I can tell.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.960]   If I've got too many other things going on, I haven't slept well, a lot of stress,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.600]   I can tell that fasting is kind of making me jittery and not feel good versus if I have
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   good capacity, I can feel that it's actually making me feel really incredible.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.600]   And so tune in with your body, obviously, and you can check your biomarkers.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.160]   If you have a CGM on, you can see what's happening in your glucose.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.800]   If you have a ketone monitor, you can see what's happening in your ketones and really
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.680]   actually track, which I think makes fasting actually even more fun.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.480]   I'll mention one other piece of data that I think is actually really kind of fun as
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.160]   well with timing of eating.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.840]   There was a study that looked at people who ate the exact same meal at 9.30 a.m. or 8.30
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.600]   p.m., so basically after dark, essentially in the part of the diurnal phase when we probably
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.120]   shouldn't be eating versus early in the morning, 9.30.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.580]   And the glucose and insulin responses for the same meal at 8.30 p.m. were significantly
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.160]   higher than when eating at 9.30 a.m.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.280]   And so again, bang for your buck.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.680]   It appears that eating in that earlier part of the day when we're active and our chronobiology
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.840]   is set up for metabolism and activity, we have a lower glucose and insulin response.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.760]   There's also some evidence that melatonin, which is secreted as we get closer to sleep,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   has somewhat of an effect on impairing our insulin sensitivity transiently.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.680]   And so we may actually just be not absorbing the glucose from those meals effectively later
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   at night.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.040]   So I tend to kind of move a little bit more low-carb, I would say, throughout the day
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.920]   based on that data and what I've seen on my continuous glucose monitor, basically just
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.380]   higher spikes for the same meal later in the day.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:28.040]   So why not just kind of move it up earlier?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
