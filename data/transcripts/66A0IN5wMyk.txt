[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   I've long been interested in shifting one's emotions and when that feels good, when it
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.860]   is good, and when it doesn't feel good.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.600]   I asked our friend Ethan Cross about this too, I'm not going to compare your answers
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.300]   as a template for who's right, who's wrong, I think there are a lot of differing opinions
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.300]   on this.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.460]   I know from the time we are young kids, we don't like to be shifted, we don't like people
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.140]   to impose an emotional requirement on us.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.980]   In fact, my niece when she was little, I was telling her this, she's 18 now, she was not
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.460]   amused, which delighted me that she was not amused, but when she was little, she was a
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.820]   pretty healthily stubborn kid and you'd ask her to do anything, like, "Hey, let's go downstairs
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.100]   for a walk," and she loved going outside for walks and she'd say, "No, push me."
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.300]   And then she would get her stuff and then you go for a walk, but I loved her like, "No,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300]   push me."
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300]   I love this.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.160]   Costello was like, "Don't push me," you couldn't.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.100]   So there was this immediate vocalization from the time she could speak really, I was like,
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.940]   "No, I'm gonna decide how I feel."
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.780]   Such a healthy thing too, such a healthy thing.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780]   You're not gonna shift me, I was like, "We're going out for a walk, it's gonna be fun,"
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.020]   and she'd say, "No, push me," and then she'd go for the walk.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.540]   Most of the times it was a fun walk.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.060]   But I think that we don't like to be shifted, and in some ways we don't really like to shift
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060]   ourselves.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.660]   Like when we're in a given emotion, when people are feeling upset, they don't wanna be told
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.580]   they should feel happy.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.060]   And yet no one really wants to be upset, although there's this, do you know this result?
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.960]   I don't wanna spin off into a long discussion about this, but Robert Heath, a very controversial
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.400]   neurosurgeon from the '70s and '80s, did these experiments of stimulating in different parts
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.080]   of the brain, allowing people to self-stimulate different parts of their brain.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.520]   And there were only three subjects, 'cause it's an in vivo human neurostimulation experiment.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.040]   All three subjects, by far their favorite area to stimulate was this midline central
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   nucleus, midline thalamic nucleus rather.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.200]   All three of them reported that the sensation that they would lever press the most for was
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100]   frustration and mild anger.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   Humans like that shit.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.100]   Excuse my language.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   Why?
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.320]   Look, the horror movie industry would not exist if we didn't like fear, right?
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Honestly, like Twitter X, whatever we're calling it now, would not exist if we didn't like
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.440]   outrage, right?
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.120]   These are kind of complicated negative emotions that have some positive benefit to us.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.880]   And I think that this is something that people get wrong when they hear my line of research.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.480]   You know, I tell people like, "Oh, I teach this class about happiness at Yale," and people
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.040]   will say like, "Oh, you just want everybody to be happy.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160]   You sort of embrace this toxic positivity."
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   And I'm like, "No, no, no, no."
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   Toxic positivity?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   Toxic positivity.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   Yeah, it's this idea.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360]   I mean, you kind of see it in our culture right now.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.600]   It's this sort of good vibes only, right?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.640]   It's this idea that anything that feels mildly frustrating or hard to do, it's like, "Oh,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.640]   no, no, just don't do that."
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520]   It's like good vibes only, right?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.400]   And there's this idea that if you're experiencing negative emotions, if you feel sad or you
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.840]   feel a little lonely or you feel a little upset at politics, whatever it is, that something's
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.520]   wrong or you got to take a pill or you got to do something to fix it, right?
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.960]   I think that's a really dangerous idea, right?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.060]   Because it's getting rid of this signal that we've been built to experience evolutionarily
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.360]   that's really important, right?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   If you're experiencing outrage, that's telling you something super crucial.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.200]   If you're experiencing kind of frustration, overwhelm is a big one.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.120]   If you're kind of feeling, "Oh, I'm so overwhelmed at work and I'm burned out," that's a really
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.120]   useful signal about behavioral changes you should make.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   In class, I often tell my students that negative emotions are like that dashboard on your car.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   You go in your car and you're like, you know, sometimes you're driving, the tire light comes
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.880]   on or the engine light comes on.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.920]   And that's a pain in the ass, honestly, because you're like, "Oh, I got to deal with it."
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.760]   So it's not fun when these lights come on, but it's super useful information that if
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.420]   you actively ignore it for months and months, it's going to cause a much bigger problem
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.420]   later on.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.520]   And I think this is how all of our negative emotions work.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.400]   If you're feeling that, you know, negative emotion of loneliness, it means you need more
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   social connection.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   If you're feeling overwhelmed, it means you probably got to take something off your plate
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.040]   before you burn out or get sick.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.920]   If you're feeling sad, like that's probably because of some, you know, stimulus that matters
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.320]   that is like kind of you're not there anymore, if you're feeling grief and so on.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.160]   I think too often we just like want to get rid of those.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.600]   We don't like them, so we want to suppress those emotions.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.700]   But suppressing our emotions is giving up useful evolutionary information that probably
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.840]   means we can take action to fix and feel better.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.800]   Americans might be surprised to hear this, but I learned this from my father who's from
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   South America.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   He's from Argentina, went to British schools when he was young.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.360]   And he told me when I was probably 10 or 12, I can't remember exactly how old, he said,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   you know, in the British formal school system, if you act too happy, people accuse you of
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   being stupid.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.900]   You know, to be gleeful or happy.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.820]   And I said, now I would say, well, they're perfectly fine being happy when they're drinking.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.000]   I will say that the after work alcohol culture in London.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.260]   The 5 of 14 p.m. crowd.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.440]   I don't know if it's still the case, but they drink a lot.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.720]   And then they get very like outwardly happy.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.020]   But there's this idea, and this was true when I came into academia, that if somebody wasn't
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.400]   super serious, that they might be stupid.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.680]   And I think in the United States now, we tend to celebrate more expressions of glee.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.980]   But that's usually in the context of like celebrity and wealth, like these people getting
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.100]   on their private planes or something.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.780]   But I think there's still some elements to this that we internalize, that if you're happy,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.420]   that you're not worrying about something.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.340]   If you're not worrying about something, then you're ignoring the woes of the world.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.540]   Maybe even the threats that are all around you.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.300]   And so in some ways, we are conditioned to always want to be happy, that does seem to
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   be one message.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.020]   But then we also get the conflicting message that to be happy is to be ignorant of what's
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.260]   really happening, if not to you, then to other people, and therefore you're not fulfilling
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.340]   your role in society.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.940]   So who are you to be happy all the time?
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.500]   There's a lot of judgment written into this thing around happiness, I'm realizing.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   Yeah, totally.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.020]   And I think you're bringing up something that I actually worry about a lot, which is, is
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.740]   that hypothesis correct?
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.820]   Is it the case that if you're feeling happy, you just ignore the woes and all the terrible
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   stuff in the world?
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.540]   Because then I'm creating a whole generation of Yale students who are going to not fix
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.740]   the bad problems of life.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.500]   And so it turns out there's a researcher at Georgetown, Konstantin Kushlev, who's tested
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   this.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.620]   He actually asked the question, is it the case that people who are experiencing more
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.580]   positive emotion, more satisfaction with life, do they ignore the problems of the world and
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580]   not act?
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.660]   Or are they the ones kind of going out and doing stuff?
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.740]   And so he did this in a couple different contexts.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.460]   He looked for social justice causes, I'll tell the climate version.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.500]   So he looked at how many people are taking climate action.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   So do you go to a protest?
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.620]   Do you put solar panels on?
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.900]   Are you donating money to climate causes?
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.980]   And he finds that the people who are really climate anxious, they tend to have less positive
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.980]   emotions.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.060]   You're really worried about climate change.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.220]   You tend to be more on the depressed, anxious side.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.340]   But if you're doing stuff about it, then you tend to have more positive emotion.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.300]   I think he assumes the causal arrow goes in the other way, that if you're happier, if
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.980]   you're experiencing lots of delights and positive emotion, you kind of have the bandwidth to
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.980]   do stuff, right?
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.700]   You can go to that protest, where if you're super depressed, you're just going to like
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.060]   lie in bed with your duvet.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.100]   You don't have the bandwidth to do this stuff.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.980]   And so this whole kind of like Pollyanna-ish hypothesis about happiness, it makes complete
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.980]   intuitive sense.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.740]   But if you look at the data, it's actually the opposite, which is a good thing because
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.300]   I think it gives us a mandate not to stay depressed about everything in the world, pissed
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.500]   off about what's happening.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.140]   Yes, those negative emotions are good to notice and experience and act on, but like we can
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.100]   take care of ourselves and it's okay.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.380]   It doesn't mean we're going to stop doing good stuff in the world.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.380]   [music]
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:01.380]   [music]
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.380]   [music]
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.380]   [music]
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380]   [music]
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.380]   [music]
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.960]   (upbeat music)
