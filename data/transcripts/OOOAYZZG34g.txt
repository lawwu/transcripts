[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120]   We are gonna close out the week
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.240]   looking at an intimate question,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.480]   a dark and mysterious question
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.280]   that we all face in this life.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.080]   It's inevitable, the moment of our personal passing.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.520]   A podcast listener named Jim writes in to simply ask this,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   does God determine when we each die?
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.820]   And was this determination made
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.720]   from even before we were born?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.600]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jim?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.120]   Yes and yes.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.560]   He does, God does determine when everybody dies
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.600]   and he did decide that in eternity.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.840]   So those are my answers.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   The first thing to say is that God governs
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   with infinite wisdom and power
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.800]   everything that takes place.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   Ephesians 1, 11, God works all things
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.280]   according to the counsel of his will.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.320]   There is no reason contextually or biblically
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.840]   or theologically to limit that all things.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.140]   So God governs all things.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.880]   That applies to the giving of life
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.320]   and the sustaining of life and the taking of life.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.920]   He works everything, including when we are born
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.200]   and when we die, according to the counsel of his will.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920]   For example, in Acts 17, 25,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000]   he is not served by human hands as though he needed anything
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.600]   since he himself gives to all mankind
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040]   life and breath and everything.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.820]   Or again, 1 Timothy 6, 13,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.060]   I charge you in the presence of God
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.280]   who gives life to all things
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.360]   and of Jesus Christ, et cetera.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.360]   Here's more specifically,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.020]   James applies this sovereignty precisely
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.460]   to whether and when we die.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.920]   He says that instead of saying,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.080]   we're going up to such and such a town
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   to do some business there and get a profit,
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.800]   quote, "You ought to say," this is James 4, 15,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   "You ought to say, if the Lord wills, we will live."
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.160]   Now that just settles it for me.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.240]   And do this or that.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   And then James adds, "As it is, you boast in your arrogance."
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.300]   Meaning he thinks it's arrogant to presume
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.720]   we live one second longer than God wills for us to live.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080]   All such boasting is evil.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.160]   That's James 4, 15 to 16.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   The point is only if God wills do I live another minute.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.100]   Therefore, the Lord decides when I die.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.860]   Jesus put it this way.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.320]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.060]   And not one of them will fall to the ground,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.540]   meaning die, apart from your father.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.500]   Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.840]   Fear not, therefore, a cure of much more value
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.900]   than the sparrows.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.360]   Now what's the point?
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   The point is if the time for the death of a tiny bird
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.980]   in a remote forest is of a concern to God
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.580]   and determined by God,
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.740]   how much more will our days be numbered
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.740]   and determined by God with great care and wisdom?
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.320]   In fact, the psalmist says,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.340]   "Your eyes, O God, saw my unformed substance in your book
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.820]   were written every one of them,
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.380]   namely the days that were formed for me
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.580]   when as yet there was none of them."
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.260]   Which means the days that God has allotted for me and you
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.620]   are already written in a book.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.300]   They are decided.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.420]   There aren't any extra ones outside the book
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.440]   that slip up on God.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.900]   Job confessed this about his own children
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.640]   when they had all died in a storm.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.700]   naked I shall return.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.260]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.100]   Hannah says the same thing.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.100]   In 1 Samuel 2, 6, the Lord kills
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.740]   and the Lord brings to life.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.900]   He brings down to shield and raises up.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.120]   In other words, life and death are in the hand of God.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.700]   Moses says the same thing when he quotes God
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   in Deuteronomy 32, 39, "See now that I, even I am he
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.800]   and there is no God besides me.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.100]   I kill and I make alive.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.180]   I wound and I heal.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.260]   There is none that can deliver out of my hand."
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.060]   So my answer is, yes, God is God.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.500]   He governs the world and that includes the time
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.040]   for our conception in the womb and the time for our death.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.860]   His children don't want to have it any other way.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.680]   I mean, God is always better than blind fate.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.240]   God is always better than random chance.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.480]   God is always better than demonic triumphs.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.360]   What else would we want than for God to determine
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.520]   when we're born and when we die?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.700]   And in answer to the other part of Jim's question,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.120]   there are reasons for saying that God decides this
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   in eternity, whether we live or die and how long we'll live.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.420]   One of the reasons is that he speaks of our being chosen
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.680]   in Christ before the foundation of the earth.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.420]   It's hard to imagine that God would choose us
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.980]   for salvation before creation and leave something
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.380]   as relatively insignificant as when we're born
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.540]   and when we're died, just leave that to chance
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.220]   while taking care of the big thing
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.580]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.100]   In fact, verse 11, and then I'll end where I began.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.900]   Verse 11 of Ephesians 1 says, "God works all things
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.220]   according to the counsel of his will.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.940]   There is no such thing as chance with God.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.660]   Therefore, all things are moving according to plan.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.340]   And since God knows all the future,
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.940]   he can take all things into account
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.580]   when he plans in the beginning.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.220]   He does not have to wait to see how history unfolds
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.020]   before he completes his plan.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.300]   History and our lives were planned
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.340]   and they were planned before the foundation of the world."
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.340]   So Jim, you and all God's children are in very good hands.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.900]   You are, as Henry Martin said, now let this sink in.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.940]   As Henry Martin said, you are immortal
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.580]   until God's purpose for you is complete.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.620]   What could be more thrilling?
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.140]   What could be more empowering?
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.380]   What could release more courage and risk
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.740]   in the cause of Christ than this?
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.340]   - Wow, amen.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.380]   With such a grim reality that is empowering
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.100]   and confidence giving, true.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.020]   How can we know that we're prepared personally
