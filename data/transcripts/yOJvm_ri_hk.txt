[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.480]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.460]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.460]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.620]   Today marks the fourth episode in our four episode series
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.620]   with Dr. Paul Conte about mental health.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.380]   Today's episode deals with the topic of self-care.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.100]   We hear the phrase self-care a lot nowadays,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.940]   but rarely, if ever, is self-care precisely defined.
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.100]   For instance, is self-care about pampering oneself?
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.980]   Is it about self-acceptance?
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.000]   Is self-care about just making sure we get enough sleep
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.700]   and enough exercise and have healthy relationships?
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.740]   Well, it turns out that yes, indeed,
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.040]   adequate self-care is about all of those things,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.860]   but true self-care, the topic of today's episode,
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.660]   is about far more as it relates to our mental health.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700]   True self-care is also about constructing a life narrative
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.900]   in which we frame our past, our present, and future
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900]   in a way that allows us to see what's gone wrong,
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.420]   what's gone right, and the best path to navigate forward.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.300]   So in many ways, true self-care
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.140]   is really about fostering a sense of self-awareness
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140]   and doing so within the context of a framework
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.620]   that is known to work.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.940]   And today, Dr. Paul Conte shares with us
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.740]   exactly how to do that.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.600]   He also touches on some of the things
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.260]   that if not properly understood and processed
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.580]   can inhibit our ability to take excellent care of ourselves,
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.680]   including how to properly process traumatic experiences,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.300]   something that he is expert in
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.020]   among many other topics as well.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.900]   He also touches on some of the things
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.080]   that can potentially serve as barriers to excellent self-care
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.780]   including traumatic experiences
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.420]   and explains how to frame those traumatic experiences
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.140]   so that we can best move forward.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.820]   He also shares with us various practices
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.980]   that include therapy,
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.620]   but also practices that we can carry out on our own,
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.180]   such as specific forms of meditation,
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.540]   journaling, and other ways of examining the self
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.780]   and fostering better self-care toward our mental health.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.860]   As I mentioned before, this is the fourth episode
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.520]   in our four episode series all about mental health.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.940]   I realized that perhaps not everyone
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.540]   has had the opportunity yet
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.060]   to listen to the previous three episodes in this series.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.200]   If you haven't, it certainly won't prevent you
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.320]   from gleaning important information and protocols
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.700]   from today's episode,
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.860]   but I do encourage you at some point
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.700]   to try and listen to all four episodes in this series
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.540]   because at some level they are interwoven
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.460]   at the level of concepts and of practices.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.660]   I'd also like to highlight that Dr. Paul Conte
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.700]   has generously provided some simple diagrams
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.560]   that can help you navigate today's material
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140]   and the material in the other episodes.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.620]   They are available as zero cost PDFs
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260]   by simply going to the show note captions
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.200]   where you can view them or download them.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.820]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.460]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.420]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.700]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.780]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.540]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.620]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.460]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.840]   with a licensed therapist carried out all online.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.580]   I've been doing therapy for more than 30 years.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.300]   While I confess that initially I was forced
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.740]   to do that therapy as a condition
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.460]   for being let back into high school,
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.540]   over time I learned that therapy
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.200]   is a tremendously valuable practice.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.940]   In fact, I consider doing regular weekly therapy
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.080]   as just as important as doing regular physical exercise
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.760]   in order to improve one's health.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.280]   The beauty of BetterHelp is that it makes it extremely easy
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.680]   to find a therapist that's excellent for you.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.360]   And we can define an excellent therapist
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.680]   as somebody who's going to give you a lot of support,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.320]   but in an objective way,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.200]   as well as somebody with whom you can have excellent rapport
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   and that can help you arrive
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.540]   at positively transformative insights
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.200]   that you wouldn't have otherwise had.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.220]   And with BetterHelp, they make it convenient
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.740]   so that it's matched to your schedule
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.280]   and the other aspects of your life.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.780]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.220]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.340]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.100]   Again, that's BetterHelp, H-E-L-P.com/huberman.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.700]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.220]   that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions,
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.740]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.720]   By now there's an abundance of data showing
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.460]   that even short daily meditations
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.540]   can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.060]   improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.440]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.540]   most people find it difficult to find
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.120]   and stick to a meditation practice
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.700]   in a way that is most beneficial for them.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.740]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.340]   to learn how to meditate
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.060]   and to carry out your daily meditation practice
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.980]   in a way that's going to be most effective
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.600]   and efficient for you.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.980]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.180]   of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.380]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.460]   that allows you to emerge
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.420]   feeling incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.060]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.340]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.680]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.380]   are enhanced by up to 60%,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.620]   which places the brain and body
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.780]   into a state of enhanced readiness
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.220]   for mental work and for physical work.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.280]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.900]   is that it provides a 30 day introduction course.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.500]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.980]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.060]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.420]   and regular meditator,
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.360]   Waking Up has more advanced meditations
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.440]   and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.320]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.060]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.580]   and access a free 30 day trial.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.700]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.760]   And now for my discussion about mental health
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.700]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.140]   Dr. Conte, welcome back.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.100]   - Thank you, pleasure to be here.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.660]   - For this series, we've been focusing on mental health
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.640]   and really defining what mental health is
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.680]   and a roadmap to achieve mental health.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.960]   And in episode one, you laid out for us a map,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.820]   essentially of the things that any and all of us
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.040]   can look at pretty much at any time
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.080]   with essentially any degree of resources
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.040]   to try and get a better understanding of ourselves
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.480]   and how well or not well we happen to be moving toward
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440]   or creating true mental health for ourselves.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.400]   In addition to that, you spelled out for us
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.880]   what true mental health really is.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.560]   And just to recap a little bit of that,
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.120]   it really boils down to these verb states,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.140]   action states of agency and gratitude.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.620]   And then in episode two,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.240]   you covered some of the common challenges
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   that you've observed in life and in your clinical practice.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.840]   And we address some of the ways
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.080]   that people can overcome those challenges
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.000]   by going to the map, opening the so-called cupboards,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.360]   as we're referring to them,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.320]   and asking specific sorts of questions.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.400]   And then in episode three,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.080]   we talked about how looking at the map
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   and exploring the map in those cupboards in particular
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.200]   can help people in relational aspects of life,
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.140]   romantic relationship, work relationships,
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.040]   family relationships, and the relationship to self.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.860]   - Yes, very important.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.700]   - Very important.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.900]   - The foundation of all relationships outside of ourselves.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.280]   - And I'm so glad that you highlighted
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.880]   the relationship to self because today's episode,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.660]   we will of course return to the map.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.880]   And I should mention that if people have not seen episodes
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.240]   one, two, or three, that's okay.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   Today's discussion will be entirely accessible to them,
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.800]   but I do recommend that at some point,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.400]   they especially listen to episode one
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.440]   and hopefully episodes two and three as well.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.720]   But today's discussion is really about the aspects
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   of ourselves that exist in all people and the action steps,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   the paths of inquiry that are available to all people
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.320]   that can allow anyone and everyone to improve
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.240]   their mental health, to move toward these ideals
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.280]   of agency and gratitude on a regular basis.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.240]   And as you pointed out, it is a process.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   It's not that we arrive at agency and gratitude.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   And just to reiterate, agency and gratitude are verb states.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.840]   They involve ways of being in the world.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.180]   - Right, they're active processes
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.720]   like life is an active process, right?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.920]   There's not an end point we're trying to reach, right?
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.140]   We're trying to live.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.520]   - And in thinking about today's discussion,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440]   it occurred to both of us really
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.000]   that today's discussion is really about self-care.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.840]   Self-care as a concept, I think for many people,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   evokes notions of like, okay,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.400]   you're gonna take a vacation
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.960]   or you're gonna kick your feet up or get a massage,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.800]   things of that sort.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.400]   And certainly it can involve those sorts of things.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.720]   But just as if we were having a discussion
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.640]   about physical health and we were going to talk about ways
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.200]   to take care of the physical body to enhance health span
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.520]   and lifespan, today's discussion is really about
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.200]   how to take care of the internal landscape, the mind.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.600]   Which also qualifies very strongly as self-care.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.080]   So if you would, could you tell us
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.600]   how you think about self-care?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.160]   Regardless of whether or not you have a patient
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.800]   who's dealing with severe mental illness
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.320]   or somebody who's just hitting the same speed bumps of life
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.800]   over and over again or anything in between,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.880]   what sorts of self-care practices and mindsets
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.560]   do you suggest people take on for themselves?
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.440]   And for that matter, how do you think about self-care?
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.040]   - Well, I think we start with factors
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.680]   that are really just baseline factors
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.840]   that have to be in place
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.640]   in order to achieve good things upon them.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.800]   So the basics of, we have to be eating well enough
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.160]   to feel okay and hopefully eating really well.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.040]   We have to stay hydrated, we have to get sleep,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.520]   we have to move the body.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.280]   And these are basics,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.320]   but basics a lot of people are not attending to.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.960]   Similarly, we have to be in a situation
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.040]   that isn't making fear and misery all the time.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.560]   So an example of an abusive relationship, right?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.360]   A person has to navigate out of that
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.640]   before they can really start taking care of themselves
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.320]   in the way that builds goodness, right?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.040]   So we look for the basic factors that we need to take care of
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480]   in order to then look at the factors
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.200]   that become particular to each of us.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.000]   And what we're really looking for is self-understanding.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.240]   How much can we understand about ourselves?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.680]   Be knowledgeable about what's going on inside of us,
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.160]   why it's going on.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.040]   Also, and very importantly,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.320]   being aware that we don't know everything
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.520]   that goes on inside of us and being curious about that
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.880]   and looking at how we're engaging with the world around us.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   Do we feel happy?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   Do we not feel happy?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   How do we define what happy means?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.200]   How are we engaging with the world?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.240]   Because as you were saying,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   the agency and gratitude are verb states.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.400]   So how are we living life?
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.920]   How are we engaging with the world?
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.480]   Do we feel like life is a sequence of things I have to do,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.360]   you know, for example, right?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.120]   Or are we doing things we really, really don't wanna do,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.960]   right?
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.800]   Do we have to do those things?
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.400]   How could life be different, right?
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.960]   We start looking at ourselves to assess
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.480]   how we're engaging with ourselves,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.320]   the people, the world around us,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.480]   in a way that is either generative or not generative.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.320]   If we're in that state of agency and gratitude,
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.080]   then we are gonna have periods of time
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.640]   where we feel peaceful, right?
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.000]   We feel a sense of contentment or we feel delighted.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.400]   So is any of that in my life, right?
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.960]   If not, why?
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.320]   Can I start thinking about that?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.960]   Sometimes the answer is quite clear.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.720]   Like, oh, there's this thing I love
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.240]   and I'm not doing that, right?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.400]   And I can't do it.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.480]   And then you revisit, like,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.240]   is it true that you can't do it?
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.960]   I mean, a lot of times it is not true.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.120]   And if it is true,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.160]   how does the person come to terms with that,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.560]   process that, perhaps grieve, right?
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.880]   So say if it's a loss of a person, right?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.520]   That can keep people, you know,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.240]   in terrible misery over years and years.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.200]   So there may be things we have to understand,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.480]   we have to process,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.440]   so that we can get ourselves to that place
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.520]   of knowing ourselves pretty well
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.760]   and engaging in the world
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.560]   in ways that we have a pretty good understanding of
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.200]   and that are adaptive.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   And then we look to say,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.080]   okay, now how do I make that better?
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.640]   Because now we're thinking about preventive medicine, right?
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.520]   We want our bodies to be healthy
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.080]   because of course we wanna be healthy today, right?
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.640]   But we also don't know what will happen in the future, right?
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.480]   Will there be an injury or an illness?
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.800]   I mean, eventually, like, you know,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.400]   we all have an injury or an illness in some way or another.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.860]   So we're preparing for the predictable challenges
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.240]   that will come our way in the future.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.760]   And we're well-served by doing this
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.160]   about our mental health too, right?
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.640]   There will be challenges that come our way.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.540]   There'll be losses and stressors
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.120]   and things that make us feel bad or feel scared.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   I mean, these things will happen to us.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.720]   So the healthier we are, the better today is,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.960]   and the better we set ourselves up
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.860]   to either make tomorrow even better today,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.040]   or if tomorrow gives me a challenge I don't have today,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.400]   I can meet that challenge and get back to a better place.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.640]   - So if I understand correctly,
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   it sounds like one of the cornerstones of self-care
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.300]   for sake of mental health
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.080]   involves asking really good questions about oneself.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.600]   - I don't think I've ever heard it defined that way before.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   - Yes.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.640]   - You know, it's in such stark contrast
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.940]   to the other forms of self-care,
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   which I certainly subscribe to as well,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.960]   like making sure one gets enough rest
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.400]   and, you know, avoids toxic people
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.360]   to the extent one can, et cetera,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.240]   or toxic environments and so on.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.280]   - Right, you mentioned ask questions of the self.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.880]   But the logical next question to that is,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.200]   well, what questions do I ask myself?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.580]   Sometimes we know, we have an idea, right?
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.720]   Sometimes we don't.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.480]   And this is where the construction of a life narrative,
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.580]   like let me think about my life.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.940]   Let me potentially talk about my life
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.560]   with a trusted other person.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.600]   Let me potentially write down a narrative about my life.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   And we can learn so much from doing that.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.720]   So the person who thinks back
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.240]   and starts to tell a story of themselves,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.500]   and let's say, just as an example,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.260]   you know, that story is going pretty well,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.240]   and the person is feeling pretty good about themselves.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.200]   And then say something happens and it starts to change.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.560]   Well, then this thing happened.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.640]   And then, you know, I started kind of spending time
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.880]   with different people, or I started dating different people,
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.920]   or I took a different kind of job.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.120]   And it can engender the reflection of like,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.100]   oh, things really kind of changed then.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.720]   Because the emotion systems within us
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.400]   don't care about the clock or the calendar,
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.560]   the emotions often of negative experiences
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.400]   can back map into our lives.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.800]   And someone who can tell you, I was miserable
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.280]   ever since I was a child,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.840]   can then write out a life narrative
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.360]   that describes a very happy childhood
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.920]   until something happened or something changed
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.440]   at a certain point, which could be something dramatic,
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.120]   or it might be increasing pressures of school
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.760]   or increasing social pressures
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.480]   or how things changed at puberty, right?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.580]   And if we have an understanding of that,
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.200]   we may know the right questions.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.520]   Like, for example, let's say afterwards,
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.160]   the person finds that they're drinking more.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.520]   So an example, what a common example,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.480]   instead of taking that for granted,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.120]   oh, that's what I do, right?
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   Or, yeah, I can't cope any better, right?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.580]   The negative things people will say to themselves,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.500]   the narrative can often point out, I can cope better.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.740]   I did cope better.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.700]   I did feel differently about myself.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.580]   So the life narrative can really help us
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.240]   establish the roadmap, right?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.040]   And part of what the life narrative does
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.240]   is it guides us to the places to ask the questions.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.520]   - If you would be so kind as to tell us a little bit more
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.780]   about how one would do this on their own.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.440]   So does this involve journaling things out?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.700]   I confess I have a file on my computer
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.400]   that has a bunch of other files
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.060]   that starts with age zero to five,
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.840]   and then I have some notes in there.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.820]   It's not an autobiography, far from it.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.380]   It's just kind of highlights of events that I remember,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.160]   six to 10 and so on, and places I lived.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.680]   And I use it just to kind of orient myself in time.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.440]   I actually don't know what the purpose and utility of it is,
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.320]   why I initially started doing this,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.440]   but it's an important file to me.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   And when I return to it,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.020]   I often remember additional key events.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.180]   So it's constantly growing.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.820]   I mean, these files are getting quite large.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.240]   Again, with no specific purpose
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.260]   of writing this out at any point, but just to orient.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.100]   - Right.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   You can't not learn about yourself from doing that, right?
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.580]   It exposes truths of self.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.440]   It makes you ponder about things.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.240]   It draws your attention to ways in which you've changed,
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.360]   whether you think those ways are good or bad, right?
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.400]   It draws your attention to change.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.480]   It draws your attention to the impact of external events.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.520]   And as you said, it grounds you.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.340]   It provides a way of localizing oneself in time.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.300]   Like I am here now.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.600]   Wait, how did I get here, right?
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.780]   And the thoughts and ideas of how we got here
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.140]   very much help us because often we don't do that.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.520]   We're sort of rushing headlong forward
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.400]   because in many ways our society is prompting us.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   We live in a very fast moving society.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.460]   We want information and gratification.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.280]   And often we don't even want it very fast,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.440]   but it's coming at us very fast anyway.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.600]   And to stop and reflect makes a very, very big difference.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.920]   Even to think at times beyond our generations, right?
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.240]   And to the best of my knowledge,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.540]   the vast majority of people on one side of my family,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.160]   everyone was a shepherd for like every generation
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   until like two ago, right?
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.200]   And thinking about that of like, huh, that's interesting,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.400]   right, it makes me in many ways grateful,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.560]   so grateful for the opportunity I've had.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.760]   But I also think like, well,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.660]   they lived in close-knit communities then,
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.760]   and what was that like?
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.160]   And we begin to see ourselves in a broader way,
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.380]   both in our own history and then projecting forward,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.080]   which sometimes is about children and nurturing children,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.440]   but it can certainly be about other things.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.840]   It can be about friendship, it can be about work.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.360]   So we start to see ourselves in ways that are interesting,
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.080]   that are through the lens of truth,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.600]   and that speak to our place in the world around us.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.640]   And I think this engenders both agency and gratitude, right?
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.560]   If I'm aware of like, huh, what have I done?
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.480]   What have I accomplished?
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.860]   When haven't I accomplished things?
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.540]   How might that be different?
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.200]   And a sense of gratitude for being here
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.440]   and having opportunity and even be able to think about this.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.680]   You know, my guess is when you read through those files,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.400]   that at some point you have sort of a sense of marvel,
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.680]   while like, whoa, that's me, right?
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.000]   Whether it's a good memory or it's a difficult memory,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.680]   no, it's all part of you that leads you through to today,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.920]   and you do have a better sense of self through that.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.660]   One of the feelings I most often come away
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.720]   from those excursions into those files with
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.800]   is one of gratitude,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.840]   because so much of what's in those files
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.440]   are recollections of others that I really appreciate.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.320]   Some are still alive, some aren't,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.240]   and what that's meant to me and how that carries me forward.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.980]   So that's what I do.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.720]   I'm sure there are a near infinite number of ways
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.560]   that people could do this,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.320]   but what are a few that you've seen work really well
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.760]   that people can do on their own
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.320]   or perhaps with a clinician as well?
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.820]   In fact, that raises the question,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.100]   should people share this sort of practice
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.740]   and the contents of that practice with a trusted clinician?
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.500]   - Right, yeah, I think sharing with another person
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.120]   always should be a trusted other, right?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.300]   And we can kind of take stock of that,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.040]   you know, of people have an idea of who may be safe, right?
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.120]   Often people say, oh, there's no one
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.200]   I could share something with,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.780]   but really that often comes through a lens of fear,
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.840]   you know, of exposure of self, of rejection,
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.440]   of vulnerability, which often is warranted,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.520]   but sometimes it's not.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.720]   Sometimes there really are,
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.920]   in fact, often there are safe people, right?
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.380]   So the act of doing something other
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.200]   than just thinking about something brings,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.160]   as you all know, it brings parts of our brain online
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.520]   that then are thinking in a different way.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.500]   So for example,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.040]   they may bring error correction mechanisms online.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.400]   So if I'm thinking over and over again
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.780]   that I've never been good enough to do anything,
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.960]   you know, that can be just automatic inside of me.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.200]   But if I start to write or to talk
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.800]   or even to formulate words, to talk to myself,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.360]   or to put words in my mind as if I were talking,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.560]   now we come at it in a different way.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.720]   And we can sort of ferret out the truth within us,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.600]   which might be, you know, it's not true
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.520]   that I've never been able to do things or achieve things.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.760]   And people often bring that online
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.860]   by doing something other than the same thought process
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.020]   that's gone often over and over,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.880]   and it's non-productive, and it brings down mood,
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.500]   and it raises anxiety,
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.840]   and it also builds a sense of futility.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.600]   I mean, I cannot tell you how often I've heard a person say,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.860]   like, "No good will come of this,"
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.700]   or like, "Okay, try, we'll try, but I know I can't be helped.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.920]   I've been thinking about this for 10 years or 20 years."
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.720]   But what they've been doing is the same thing.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.200]   They've been ruminating on it for 10 years.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.560]   They start talking about it,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.520]   and people will say, "Oh my goodness.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.180]   I've achieved more in two hours than I did in years," right?
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.840]   But that's because you're doing something different
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.760]   in the two hours.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.720]   So I think that's very important,
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.580]   especially because we can't say,
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.600]   "Okay, go look in your unconscious mind
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.320]   and see what you find there," right?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.280]   So then we need ways of accessing the unconscious mind,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.600]   and the communication, either with self,
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.440]   in writing, with others,
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.920]   can be very, very helpful in doing that.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   I also, I am a firm believer that knowledge is power.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.440]   Many times, I will feel like I have a sense
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.900]   of really having helped someone,
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.540]   and the other person may have that sense,
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.160]   and we can see the change,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.000]   and all that I've done is impart knowledge, right?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   We all know different things.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.240]   So often it's the case that,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.320]   hey, I happen to have learned things
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.820]   that are different from what that other person learns,
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.080]   and then I'm communicating to them things
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.400]   that I have learned so they know them too,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.180]   and then they feel tremendously better, right?
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.160]   Because if we put inside of ourselves
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   the tools of understanding,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.400]   our unconscious minds,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.360]   and sometimes our conscious minds too will work on them,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.720]   will make use of them.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.060]   So if you talk to a person, for example,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.360]   about how trauma can impact us,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.320]   and how we can shove it underneath the surface,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.180]   and how it can spin off shame,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.800]   then that person may take that knowledge away
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.840]   and come back with real understanding,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.120]   and the fact that we can do this on our own, right?
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.800]   We can do this through good resources.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.880]   We can do this by taking information into ourselves.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.280]   That can be very, very helpful,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.360]   and it doesn't require,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.200]   because the first place to start
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.560]   are with things we can do
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.500]   that don't require professional help, right?
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.440]   And sometimes we may come at problems
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.400]   that do tell us that we should get professional help, right?
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.680]   So if we're having thoughts of self-harm,
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   thoughts of not wanting to be alive,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.920]   thoughts of real despair,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.940]   thoughts of hopelessness,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.720]   that's telling us, okay, let's get some help.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.340]   There's a role and a place for professional help.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.660]   But people come to professional help in other ways too,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.400]   such as, for example, reflecting on the self.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.300]   And so real example, a person thinking,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.220]   you know, it really became kind of different
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.740]   when things started changing.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.220]   Like after college, and then I thought like,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.800]   oh, I've kind of gotten to this place,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.840]   and I've got a good job,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.720]   and like, things really should get better.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.280]   But like, they kind of haven't, right?
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.900]   And that was really a branch point.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.520]   That person may have never really thought about that,
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.000]   or they may have thought about it 10,000 times,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and then shoved it underneath
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.860]   from consciousness to unconsciousness,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.660]   because it's a scary, vulnerability-inducing thing.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.200]   It seems scary, like, how could it be
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.260]   that I achieved things and didn't get healthier?
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.080]   Now we're afraid of that, right?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   And letting that come to the surface,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.140]   being able to say, oh, like, that's true.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.040]   Like, I don't have to be afraid to shine light on that.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.840]   Then a lot of times, that alone,
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.760]   sometimes a person will solve their own problems.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.400]   They think about it, they come in,
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.080]   they have all the answers, they thank me,
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.520]   I did nothing but listen,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.480]   but the listening part is important.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.640]   It allowed them to come in and say what they needed to say.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.320]   And other times, then, it's not,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.280]   it can be that, but it's not always that.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.520]   Other times, it informs us about what to work on clinically,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.560]   and it might not be something that's dire, right?
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.800]   It might just be like, I wanna understand this.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.280]   I wanna be happier, I wanna be healthier,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.760]   I wanna work towards these good things.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.480]   When people talk about that,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.200]   they're always, if you really distill them,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.100]   what are they talking about?
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.000]   A sense of peace, a sense of contentment,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.440]   coming at the world through agency and gratitude.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.560]   And we can do that through self-inquiry,
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.280]   including through therapy.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.440]   It doesn't have to just be for situations
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.880]   where, oh, there's a significant clinical problem.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.580]   - Is it the case that when somebody journals
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.080]   a bit of their life narrative
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   or thinks about some great or sadly traumatic events
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.120]   that perhaps happened to them at whatever stage of life,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.360]   that there's something accomplished in that action
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.760]   or in that therapy session
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.920]   if they're doing it with a clinician,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.280]   but that when they go to sleep that night
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.600]   and perhaps in their waking states as well,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.720]   that the unconscious is working some of that through
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.680]   such that revelations come to mind later,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.000]   insights come to mind.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.680]   I'm certainly familiar with the fact
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.180]   that there are certain times of day and evening
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.520]   where my brain is in a bit of a liminal state.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.720]   It feels like somewhere between sleep and awake.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.880]   And I just have learned that provided I block
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   against outside sensory input as much as I can,
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.620]   in particular, social media and the news,
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.160]   that I'll just be doing the dishes
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.440]   or preparing coffee or something.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.200]   And something will come to mind
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.120]   that's seemingly out of nowhere, right?
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.560]   It's not always a great insight.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.480]   In fact, it's rarely a great insight.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.860]   But it always takes me a bit by surprise,
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.160]   sometimes a little bit of delight,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.240]   sometimes a little bit of shock,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.100]   like, wow, where did that come from?
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.840]   - 'Cause it came from your unconscious mind, right?
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.160]   It was invisible to you then it got thrown up
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.920]   and you're like, whoa, and you realize it
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.200]   while in the midst of doing something relatively mundane.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.100]   Because during the day, you're engaging,
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.220]   your brain is highly engaged, which is great,
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.880]   but it doesn't leave a lot of room
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.360]   for the unconscious mind to do its millions
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.520]   and millions of things a second
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.280]   that can help you figure things out,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.000]   which is the same reason, I mean, it's uncanny.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.240]   Any psychiatrist will tell you this,
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.360]   that people, a person will come in and say,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.880]   it's strange, you know, all of a sudden,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.920]   when I can finally relax,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.640]   like, that's when I have a panic attack, right?
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.960]   Or they don't know, like, then I can finally relax
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.440]   and I go, ah, and then my heart's beating fast
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.960]   and I'm sweating, right?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.740]   Because that's when the panic attacks come.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.120]   If the person is laboring under something
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.480]   that is causing them this sort of constant distress,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.600]   when you stop focusing outward
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.160]   and you sort of settle into an inward state,
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.360]   then the things that are underneath the surface
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.620]   are gonna come to the surface.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.700]   And if there's something really bothering you
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.520]   that your brain is very upset about or very afraid of,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.580]   what does it throw up to the surface?
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.380]   A panic attack, right?
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.740]   But if you're in a good place,
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.080]   you're taking care of yourself,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.640]   you're in a generative stage, you're in a safe environment,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.160]   then when you stop putting all the attention outward.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.680]   So we imagine then salience changes
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.800]   and instead of a lot of the salience being outward,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.400]   it starts to be inward and you're just sort of meditative.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.620]   You're washing the dishes, right?
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.500]   And there's room then for your unconscious mind
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.860]   to throw something important to the surface.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.560]   It's the exact opposite of how people can't
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.680]   remember something if they're trying to think of it.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.840]   I mean, we all go through this,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.440]   like, oh, I can't remember that person's name
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.800]   or that restaurant or whatever it is.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.440]   Try to keep thinking about it
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.280]   and see if you figure it out, right?
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.160]   The answer is not in your conscious mind.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.240]   So if you keep bringing your conscious mind to bear,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.340]   you just generate frustration, right?
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.960]   But then when you stop thinking about it,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.380]   the answer's there inside of you, oh, I remember now, right?
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.160]   So that's how if we have the conscious mind engage
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.480]   in something it's not gonna figure out, right,
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.060]   then it doesn't figure the thing out, right?
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.440]   And that works for our problems too.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.720]   That's why a person can say,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.680]   I thought about that for 10 years.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.080]   Well, you ruminated about it for 10 years.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.360]   It just ran over and over and over in the conscious mind
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.940]   and how ironic, right?
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.720]   It prevents understanding.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.500]   - So it's very clear to me that asking certain kinds
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.840]   of questions about oneself and oneself narrative,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.680]   life history essentially, can be very beneficial
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.840]   in the moment or moments of doing that practice
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.200]   as well as the subconscious or I guess the appropriate way
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000]   to refer to it as the unconscious, right?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.400]   Okay, so for those out there who like me
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.660]   sometimes say subconscious, it's unconscious.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.600]   The unconscious can throw things up to the surface
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.880]   that can be real insights, can give us
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.720]   not just panic attacks, which I think most people
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.640]   would like to shy away from, but as you point out,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.820]   there's information in the fact that the panic attack
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.000]   is occurring under conditions of wrath.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.920]   - And if you stir up the pot of the unconscious
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.240]   and you put some new information in, it can do new things.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.960]   It can figure new things out, which is why the process
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.160]   of self-reflection, for example, and often the process
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.280]   of therapy is not always and in fact often is not
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.480]   a pleasant process, right?
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.820]   But then we take away from that hard work renewed insights.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.160]   So someone, this happens all the time, who knows,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:32.000]   they know that a certain trauma is inside of them
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.120]   and has been affecting them, whether it's for days
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.720]   or weeks or years.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.600]   They know it, they don't know what to do about it,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.580]   they have a conflict about it, so they keep trying
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.840]   to shove it under the surface, they finally accept
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.560]   for whatever reason to talk about it.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.520]   And what often happens then is, let's say doing three
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.160]   or four successive weeks of hourly therapy,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.140]   I mean, that person is crying and that person is upset
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.280]   or that person is angry, I mean, it doesn't always happen
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.580]   this way, but it does a fair amount of the time,
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.200]   as they get better and better, right?
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.540]   Because they're discharging some of the energy, right?
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.200]   Maybe they're crying and they're sad because they're
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.720]   grieving something they haven't grieved before, right?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.060]   Because they've just been angry, right?
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.540]   Or they've just been ashamed, a classic example is a death.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.000]   I mean, how many times do people think, well,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.120]   that can't be still affecting me, it was X number
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   of years ago, but they've never actually grieved
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.500]   because they carry in them, oh, it was my fault, right?
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.540]   And how many times do we hear that?
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.240]   I should have said something different before,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.640]   I should have gone, you know, we then back map something
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.360]   that makes us feel bad and then from the guilt and shame
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.600]   comes the inability to process grief.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.140]   So if the person then deals with, right, I feel so bad
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.060]   about this, in fact, I feel so ashamed of it and I feel
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.960]   like it's my fault and so, okay, well, let's talk about that,
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   right, after my brother's death by suicide,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.240]   I felt responsible, I was not involved in any way
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.560]   in mental health, I had a business career at the time
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.080]   and I finally went and saw someone, I wasn't acculturated
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.680]   that getting therapy was something one did,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.000]   but I realized, hey, I'm not okay, right?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   So I didn't know how, right, I just knew the manifestation
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   of it, which was misery and risk and, you know,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.220]   I could just tell, like, I know what it feels like
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.800]   to not feel like this and this is not okay.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.360]   So then I, you know, I called the insurance number,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.200]   eventually I go in and see a therapist and, you know,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.160]   she did, I'm sure she was a very good therapist,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.480]   but she didn't, in a sense, need to be,
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.920]   in the sense that sometimes we don't need to use
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.240]   all the things we know, we can do just something basic
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.400]   with someone and that's all she did with me.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.740]   I mean, she got me talking about it and then I talked about
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.320]   how ashamed I was because it was my fault and then really?
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.580]   And then she challenged me about that and then, you know,
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.960]   in a nice way, but then it became clear that I was
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.200]   so utterly shocked by it, right, far from it being
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.680]   foreseeable to me, right, that the problem that I was having
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.520]   now was the shock of it and the sense of shame and guilt
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.240]   that it raised in me and then me shoving it under the surface
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   not knowing what to do with it, then it's making all sorts
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.940]   of misery in me and I can't actually grieve, right?
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.600]   So at some point during those sessions, now I'm sad
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.200]   and I'm crying, right, and I know what she was thinking,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.580]   right, she's good, okay, this is like, thank goodness,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.320]   this person is getting better, she might have felt a sense
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.880]   of relief because she could say, hey, he's coming out
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.160]   of risk, he's able to feel sadness, he's able to grieve,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.200]   he hasn't been doing this before, you know?
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   So it's that work, if we put into it that makes a difference
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.400]   just as in physical health, I mean, if I wanna be stronger,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.640]   I wanna be more robust, like I have to go to the gym
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.800]   and work or I have to do something, that's hard work
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.360]   and then I get the benefit of it and the same is true
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.340]   whether we're reflecting on our life narrative
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.280]   and it brings, you know, some difficult emotions to us
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.320]   or whether we're talking with someone or whether we're doing
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.920]   it in therapy but that's how that process of inquiry leads
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.520]   us, you know, to take some of the Gordian knots in us,
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.600]   so to speak, and to cut them instead of trying to figure out
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.280]   like, how am I gonna feel okay about myself even though
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.120]   I'm responsible for my brother's death because I should've
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.480]   foreseen it, I mean, that doesn't work, right?
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.920]   You have to say like, I see what that thing is and that has
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.280]   to go away, right, and then therapy can lead us to the point
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.260]   where oh, it wasn't my fault and oh my goodness, I'm sad.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.020]   - I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge one
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.160]   of our sponsors, AG1, AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.000]   drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.660]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012, so I'm delighted
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.040]   that they're sponsoring the podcast, the reason I started
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.400]   taking AG1 and the reason I still take AG1 once or generally
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.660]   twice per day is that it's the easiest way for me to ensure
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.400]   that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals, probiotics
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.420]   and fiber that I need in my diet.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.560]   Now, of course, it's essential to get proper nutrition
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.660]   from whole foods but most people including myself find it
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.360]   hard to get enough servings of fruits and vegetables
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.040]   each day and especially to get enough prebiotics
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.400]   and probiotics to ensure gut health.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   As you may know, your gut contains trillions
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.840]   of little microbiota, the so-called gut microbiome
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.560]   which establishes critical connections with other organs
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.680]   of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.520]   your immune system and other aspects that relate to mental
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.460]   and physical health.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.220]   One of the most common questions I get is if you were
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.920]   to take just one supplement, which supplement would that be?
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.960]   And my answer is always AG1 because by taking AG1,
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.140]   I'm able to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.300]   minerals and probiotics that I need to enhance my mental
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.120]   health, physical health and performance.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.540]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.920]   to claim a special offer.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.540]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.920]   and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.080]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.100]   to claim this special offer.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.040]   I can see how self-inquiry is really powerful.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.220]   I've certainly experienced that in my own life
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.700]   and it's an ongoing process, right?
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.860]   This is not something that one does and then stops.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.120]   Ideally you do it forever, just like physical fitness.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.700]   And at the same time, I know that a number of people
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.820]   perhaps are wary of self-inquiry, especially because
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.580]   of the pain points it can bring about and make conscious
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.320]   and that we have to really sit with.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.220]   And most people would like to avoid discomfort.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.340]   I'm sure there are also people who are doing quite well
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.900]   in life and therefore think, oh, pattern of self-inquiry,
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.820]   all it could do, it sounds like is more harm,
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.920]   like why would I want to do that?
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.340]   But I think we both agree that there's nothing but good
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.840]   and progress and more agency and gratitude to be had
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.100]   by going through patterns of self-inquiry.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.900]   - I think that really highlights something very important,
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.460]   which is that self-inquiry isn't always the right answer.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.940]   Now, I think just because things are going well,
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.780]   that doesn't mean self-inquiry isn't the right thing to do.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.460]   Self-inquiry is always the right thing to do
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.580]   if we want to understand ourselves better,
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.440]   unless we're in a place where it can bring real risk to us.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.200]   So when I was trying to think about myself and inquire,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.460]   why was I so miserable?
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.700]   What's going on in me?
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.300]   I mean, I reached a point where I realized like,
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.700]   I'm not getting myself anywhere and I'm getting worse.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.860]   And like, this is now, this is not good for me.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.380]   'Cause where did the self-inquiry lead me
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.860]   to more guilt and shame?
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.060]   So then at some point I sort of pulled the rip cord, right?
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.560]   I was like, I can't do this on my own anymore, right?
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.020]   And that's very, very important to anyone who's listening.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.020]   If you feel like, look, I don't think I'm in a safe
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.100]   or a stable place.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.800]   Again, thoughts of self-harm, thoughts of hopelessness,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.180]   then it probably is not,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.420]   or let's err on the side of being cautious, right?
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.740]   It is not a good idea then to engage in self-inquiry, right?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.580]   First, go see someone clinically, right?
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.020]   And I know that can be hard to do in this day and age,
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.780]   but if we really advocate for ourselves, we really push,
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.100]   we really, we do whatever we can do
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.740]   to try and get in front of someone
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.780]   who can kind of help us understand what we may need.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.060]   And maybe that person helps us
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.940]   with the process of self-inquiry.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.500]   Maybe that person reassures us.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.460]   Maybe that person then tells us
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.780]   that we really do need more care, more help.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.840]   And then it leads to us getting that
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.500]   so that we can come back to the good place
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.020]   of being well enough for the self-inquiry.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.980]   - I'm grateful you shared your path
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.620]   to working with a clinician
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.420]   and the fact that just focusing on something on your own
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.060]   wasn't really working.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.480]   And there was a, it sounds like a requirement
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.780]   for a clinician to help guide you through that.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.140]   It relates directly to what I'm most curious about
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.640]   at this moment, which is, you know,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.400]   in the map that you established for us in episode one,
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.060]   and that has carried through all these episodes,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.580]   and by the way, if people are not familiar with the map,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.340]   we will cover it in top contour
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.080]   in a little bit more depth in a moment here.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.900]   But one of the key things, or cupboards,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.780]   as we're referring to them,
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.420]   to look in in order to exert self-care
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.600]   and improve one's mental health
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.740]   is this notion of self-awareness,
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.220]   of really understanding that there's an I, a me,
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.420]   and exploring what that's really about in the moment,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.980]   but also historically through narrative, et cetera.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   Also in this map is a cupboard that relates to salience.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.140]   What's most obvious, or what do we default to,
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.460]   both internally, in terms of what sorts of thoughts
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.820]   we default to, and externally,
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.100]   what are we focusing on in the outside world?
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.500]   And I think I, and perhaps many other people out there,
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.340]   are wondering how to resolve any conflict
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.340]   between a practice that is aimed
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.060]   at increasing self-awareness,
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.820]   and perhaps even drawing to mind early traumas
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.380]   or challenges, or recent traumas or challenges,
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.220]   and salience.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.940]   In other words, if I were to take some moments,
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.720]   or even an hour once a week,
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.120]   and sit there and really think about the sorts of things
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.980]   that I don't want to think about,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.580]   that have been gnawing at me below the surface
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.540]   for a very long time,
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.060]   the stuff that I've gained some proficiency
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.740]   at pushing down beneath the surface.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.220]   I think one fear that I have,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.340]   and so I have to assume other people have it as well,
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.140]   is that if I were to bring that to mind,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.900]   that it would overtake a lot of my waking hours.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.140]   Like, it's like, I don't want to think about this thing,
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.080]   or those things.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.600]   And so now what's salient is something negative.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.260]   And when I'm focused on something negative,
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.660]   then I'm not able to be as generative as I would like,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.440]   move my life, move forward toward my life goals.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.780]   Now, I could even have the realization,
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.860]   the cognitive understanding that,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.740]   okay, but that's necessary, right?
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.340]   Like, this is like getting a wound fixed
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.500]   or dealing with a chronic injury.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.140]   Like, sooner or later, you got to deal with it,
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.100]   otherwise you're not going to be at your best.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.800]   But that conflict between gaining more self-awareness
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.340]   and also the understanding that what is most salient to us
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.520]   is kind of defines the quality of our daily life.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.040]   That conflict or friction seems like an important thing
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.660]   for us to drill into a little bit.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.100]   And I would say this.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.080]   If you think there's something
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.420]   that you can't bring up into consciousness
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.420]   because it's going to take over your mind,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   or as people often say,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.160]   I'm going to curl up in a fetal position,
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.840]   I'm going to cry and never stop,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.740]   that is exactly the thing you must look at.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.660]   Because salience presents itself in a whole array of ways.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.620]   So if there's something inside of you
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.820]   that's strong enough, right,
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.600]   that it's throwing itself up to the surface,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.380]   like, hey, maybe you want to think about me, right?
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.420]   Is your unconscious mind throwing it up to the surface?
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.300]   That is active in you.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.340]   And often, although a lot of it happens
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.380]   in the unconscious mind,
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.560]   it happens also in the conscious mind.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.760]   And if the person then stops and thinks,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   how much might that thing that you are not thinking about
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.420]   be impacting you?
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.380]   How might it be salient in other ways?
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.820]   And sometimes a person will realize like,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.860]   yeah, that's on my mind.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.700]   People say, oh, that's on my mind all the time.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.460]   It's like kind of on the back burner, but always there.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.620]   And he says, right, on the back burner?
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.380]   You know, that's like having a voice in the background
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.640]   telling you something very negative or very distressing.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.220]   And it's just one example where oftentimes
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.900]   there's a realization
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.700]   that that thing is actually quite salient.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.300]   Sometimes there isn't a realization until later.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.180]   Oh, the salience of that is that that's how,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.060]   that's why I don't let myself get ahead, right?
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.400]   It can come out later because, you know,
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.040]   we don't know how much of it is unconscious,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.540]   how much of it is conscious,
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.060]   but under the right circumstances, if things are safe,
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.860]   as we said, if there's not something going on
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.660]   that presents risk and warrants clinical care,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.780]   if there's something inside of you and you think,
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.260]   I can't let that to the surface,
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.960]   then what that is telling you is,
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.640]   I must let that to the surface.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.060]   Now, again, we wanna do it in judicious ways
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.740]   and do it in ways that are safe, but that's the message.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.540]   I think it's especially important that you mentioned
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.780]   that if something is gnawing at our conscious mind
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.380]   every once in a while,
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.660]   then it absolutely has to be operating
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.460]   below the level of our conscious awareness.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.540]   - Maybe running amok.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.360]   - All the time.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.700]   - Below the level of consciousness, yes.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.780]   - So if ever there was a cause
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.900]   for exploring something like that, that's it, right?
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.180]   Because we can't be aware of the ways
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.380]   that's damaging to us or limiting us.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.340]   Again, you know, somebody listening to this
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.540]   could be doing quite well.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.380]   They're thinking, I'm doing great.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.980]   Like, why would I wanna do any of this?
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.580]   Well, perhaps they could be doing that much better.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.840]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.700]   - Self-awareness and addressing one's personal narrative
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.640]   and a sense of I is what we called covered one
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.040]   under the function of self.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.500]   Now, for those that listen to episodes one, two, or three,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.460]   they'll be familiar with what I'm talking about
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.880]   when I say a covered one function of self.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.000]   But just for sake of getting everybody on the same page
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.940]   as we move forward here,
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.780]   maybe we could just return to the map of mental health
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.700]   for a moment.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.740]   You know, we've talked about agency and gratitude
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.940]   as verb states.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.740]   And you also described in previous episodes
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.740]   this key really essential concept of this generative drive.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.620]   So if you could just take a few minutes for us
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.540]   and really explain what agency and gratitude are,
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.660]   how one goes about building those up and expressing those,
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.540]   and what the generative drive is,
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.980]   and then we'll return to the 10 cupboards of inquiry
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.960]   under the structure of self and function of self,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.660]   which really represent the pillars and all the stuff
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.180]   that geysers up into these simple
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.540]   but extremely powerful concepts and ways of being,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.380]   which are agency and gratitude.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.860]   - Yes, yes.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.860]   So I really liked when you brought the image of a geyser
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.620]   to mind, because if we think about the structure of self,
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.060]   which is one pillar, and the function of self,
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.140]   which is another pillar, underneath those pillars,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.900]   there are the 10 cupboards we've been talking about.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.900]   And they represent the areas of inquiry for us,
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.340]   because they're the aspects of the structure
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.820]   and function of self.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.720]   So that's where the answers are, right?
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.500]   The answers are in those pillars.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.620]   The answers are in those 10 cupboards.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.500]   So if we're doing that, we're looking there,
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.380]   we're honoring what we find there,
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.340]   we're becoming healthier than that geyser, right?
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.340]   I imagine it coming out, you know,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.940]   like the space in between the pillars, right?
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.940]   And what it is lifting up is first empowerment and humility.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.380]   But empowerment and humility are qualities.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.180]   It's certainly the way, and the way we're using them,
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.720]   they're qualities, they're potential.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.060]   So I have empowerment as opposed to being disempowered,
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:46.900]   right?
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.180]   So I have humility instead of, for example,
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.760]   a reactive grandiosity, or even a reactive self oppression.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.260]   So I have these qualities of empowerment and humility,
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.180]   and then they become enacted, right?
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.680]   They become expressed by us.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.060]   And I imagine riding on the top is the agency
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.800]   and the gratitude is at the top of the geyser,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.060]   and it's moving, right?
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.180]   They're verbs.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.300]   We navigate life as life moves forward, right?
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.060]   I will often think like being on like the luge, right?
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.100]   And you see in the Olympics,
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.860]   so the bridge is going down the twisting path,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.420]   and it's like, that's us moving through life, right?
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.000]   And we all have different pathways,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.260]   but they can interconnect and they can cross,
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.980]   but that's what's happening.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.080]   Living is an active thing, right?
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.500]   So agency and gratitude are active things.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.320]   Why?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.620]   Because they're the ultimate expression
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.580]   of all underneath of them.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.720]   That's where it goes.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.620]   If the pillars are in the right place,
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.260]   the geyser can function, the empowerment and humility
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.100]   are with us.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.780]   So we're engaging with ourselves, with others,
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.960]   with the world through a lens of clarity
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.900]   and through a lens of knowing we can make the world
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.340]   a better place and knowing our role in it.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.620]   That's very, very active.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.580]   And then it brings to us the peace,
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.700]   the contentment, the delight that weaves in and out.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.680]   As you described that you will feel the peace,
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.340]   the contentment, the delight
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.940]   when you're doing the solo podcast, right?
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.900]   But you're doing something very, very active, right?
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.500]   That's not, it's not a passive endeavor, right?
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.820]   During which you feel all those things,
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.180]   but that makes sense, right?
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.760]   Peace doesn't mean nothingness, right?
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.940]   Now it can, someone who's looking out the window
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.960]   at the garden they planted can feel that too.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.300]   But there's life going on in them also, right?
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.140]   They're contemplating the garden.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.980]   They know that they made the garden.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.180]   So these are all active processes
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.700]   because life is an active process.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.640]   And then we end up in this place of looking inside of us.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.500]   These drives within us are both deterministic
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.380]   and determined, right?
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.260]   So think about how active a process that is
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.060]   where we have a natural bias one way or another
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.220]   because of our genetics.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.340]   Just like someone has a natural aptitude to be taller
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.260]   and someone shorter or to be more or less athletic, right?
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.680]   We have potential within us
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.440]   when the genetics come together, right?
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.260]   And that may determine some sort of set of parameters.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.500]   So maybe someone who doesn't have the blessings
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.580]   of being so athletic, perhaps myself, right?
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.540]   I'm not gonna be the world's greatest athlete, right?
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.780]   But if I work hard, like I could be a lot more athletic
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.980]   and have been at times, right?
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.060]   And if I don't, I could be a lot less athletic, right?
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.120]   So there are potentials within us
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.260]   that get sort of genetically determined,
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:46.260]   but have a wide array of variants around them.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:51.600]   And then our choices determine where we are in that variance.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.400]   If I don't take care of myself,
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.880]   I will be on the very low end of the athletic spectrum,
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.720]   right?
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.840]   If I do and I cultivate myself,
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.280]   I can be on a higher end for me, right?
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.300]   But still that's a lot better than the lower end.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.080]   There's a very big difference.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.720]   The same is true in our drives.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.040]   So the more we're taking care of ourselves,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   we're reinforcing the primacy of the generative drive.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.200]   And then the aggression, assertion, proactive, right?
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   That drive in us is realized as best we're gonna realize it.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.940]   And not everyone's is gonna be off the chart, right?
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.440]   And that's okay, right?
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.260]   But that drive is in a place that lets that person
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.600]   take care of themselves, you know?
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.060]   Have a job they enjoy and can do well at
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.880]   and make their home life better,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.200]   whatever it is that we can do.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.340]   We're more assertive, we're more engaged.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.640]   And then that's bringing us more pleasure.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.960]   So the pleasure drive, again, it's not a hedonistic drive,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.440]   it's drive for things we enjoy.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.520]   Like we enjoy safety, we enjoy absence of pain,
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.200]   but we also enjoy friends and romance and sex and food.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.760]   Like these are things that bring us gratification
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.400]   and we can have that in a healthy place too.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.440]   So there's not too much and not too little
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.480]   of the aggression, assertion, proactive drive,
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.140]   not too much, not too little of the pleasure drive.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.800]   And then we're in a place where we can meet
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.360]   where those drives are at.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.260]   So if the pleasure drive is in a certain place in us,
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.760]   we can meet that, right?
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.340]   And maybe we foster it moving a little higher up
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.660]   because we're doing good things
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.300]   and we're taking care of ourselves.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.000]   So if our romance is in a better place,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.220]   then we can take more pleasure in our romance, right?
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.560]   If our physical fitness is in a better place,
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.040]   we can enjoy that more, right?
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.420]   We can do more things.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:46.420]   So we are helping those drives to be in the optimal place
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:50.180]   to subserve the generative drive,
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.500]   which we are trying to optimize and maximize.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.200]   And that puts us in the best place to have the things
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.440]   under those pillars in those cupboards in a good place.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.880]   And then on top of that geyser is the empowerment
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.940]   and the humility.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.380]   And then that gets enacted as agency and gratitude.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:10.360]   And we have more of the goodness of peace
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.260]   and contentment and delight,
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.520]   and that reinforces the generative drive.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.860]   So that's what's going on.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.860]   And it has never failed me yet to read or listen
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:26.500]   to someone communicating happiness,
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.320]   either what they think it is, how they found it,
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.600]   what they're striving for,
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.660]   what they think it philosophically is, right?
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.480]   It's all that, right?
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.780]   And it's not as simple as a word, right?
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.460]   Because it's complex, we're complex,
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.440]   but the beauty of it all is the complexity is within us,
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.360]   but it's not out of our reach to understand ourselves better
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.340]   and help ourselves.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:54.560]   And if we do that, as we move further up the hierarchy,
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.880]   it gets simpler.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.520]   Approaching the world through agency and gratitude as verbs,
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.720]   it's pretty straightforward.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.540]   That's why that's the best metric
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.660]   for romantic compatibility, right?
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.540]   It's not this person plays a musical instrument
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.340]   and that person's a mathematician,
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.520]   so they're not compatible.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.220]   No more than one plays the trumpet,
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.060]   one plays the clarinet, and we assume they are compatible.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.700]   Where are those drives at?
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.700]   Are people healthy, in a healthy place?
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.260]   We can then take the best care of ourselves,
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.860]   engage with others in a healthy way,
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:31.500]   understand who's a healthy other to engage with, right?
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.060]   Get ourselves out of unhealthy situations,
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.860]   and then we're building health within ourselves
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.060]   and around ourselves.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.780]   And that's how, at the different levels of emergence,
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.900]   things get better.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.660]   So if I make myself healthier
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.320]   and you make yourself healthier,
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.960]   we will be healthier as a group of two.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.820]   That's always how that is.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.020]   And if we're healthier as a group of two,
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.100]   we can be healthier as parts of larger groups, right?
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.200]   Or if the groups aren't healthy,
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.840]   we're pushing towards greater health, right?
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.340]   We're engendering health,
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.460]   and that's how we see health grow
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.800]   until it can be manifest even on a cultural level,
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.780]   where we're taking better care of ourselves.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.820]   We're less punitive.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.340]   We're less rushing forward as a society
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.100]   and trampling the vulnerable, right?
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.700]   And we realize, oh, I could be the vulnerable, right?
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.040]   I care about other people even if I don't know them
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.860]   because I can understand and empathize
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.840]   with what it feels like to be vulnerable.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.420]   And furthermore, I could be among the vulnerable.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.620]   So we behave differently as a culture,
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.880]   and that's what we're searching for on an individual level,
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.200]   all the way up to a cultural level.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.420]   - I have several questions,
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:44.520]   but first I want to just highlight what you said
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.580]   about relational structure, relationships,
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.300]   and the fact that as was explored in episode three,
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:56.340]   and you made so clear, and it just makes so much sense,
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.180]   most of what people explore for
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.740]   when looking for a romantic partner
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.100]   or determining whether or not
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   their existing romantic relationship could be better or not
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.760]   is focused on the wrong things, right?
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.460]   These very kind of superficial notions of what people enjoy
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.120]   and even level of education, some of which can really matter,
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.300]   but that's not the critical issue at hand,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.420]   and that the maps that the two individuals have
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   and the extent to which they are expressing
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.900]   their generative drive and agency and gratitude
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.700]   is far, far more important.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.000]   And so for those that haven't heard episode three
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.420]   and are interested in relationships,
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.140]   not just romantic relationships,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.700]   but relationships of all kinds, work, families,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.220]   relationship to self, friendship,
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.540]   I highly, highly recommend listening to that conversation
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.100]   because it's truly spectacular
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.720]   in terms of its actionable takeaways in by actual,
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.780]   well, I mean, actions, of course, behaviors,
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.260]   and also modes of thinking that can really serve people.
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.700]   I also just want to make one clarification
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.380]   that I believe that when you said hierarchy,
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.780]   when you said move up the hierarchy,
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.300]   you were referring to the hierarchy within the map
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.720]   that's been laid out here, right?
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.900]   As opposed to, I don't want people to get mistakenly
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.820]   distracted by the possibility that we're talking about
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:16.300]   some sort of like external social hierarchy.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.940]   So I just want to clarify that.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.200]   And that's actually a perfect jumping off place
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.260]   for going into the map with a little bit more depth
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.960]   and detail and exploring these cupboards
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.860]   that reside at the lower levels of the map
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.020]   and that are quite complex.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.660]   Okay, so for those of you listening who have not yet gone
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.000]   in access to the PDF that we put in the show, no captions,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.440]   you can do that at any point.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.900]   But what we're talking about is a bunch of things
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.900]   down at the bottom under these two pillars,
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.780]   structure of self and function of self,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.200]   these cupboards, excuse me, that are extremely valuable
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.540]   for any and all of us to look in and explore
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:55.600]   and ask specific questions because it's what resides
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.320]   within those cupboards that combine in a sort of recipe
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.520]   and then geyser up into whether or not
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.780]   and how much empowerment, humility, agency, gratitude,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.360]   peace, contentment, delight, and generative drive
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   we are able to exert and experience for ourselves in life.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.740]   So imagine in your minds, if you will,
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.340]   and here I'm borrowing directly from a picture model
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.340]   that Dr. Conti provided before the filming of this series,
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.580]   which is an iceberg where below the surface of the water
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.620]   resides a bunch of stuff and then a little bit
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.980]   is above the water and maybe you'll help us revisit
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.060]   that model now for a few moments.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.060]   But if you take nothing away at this moment,
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.260]   please understand that there's a lot of complex stuff
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.480]   going on underneath the surface of the brain and mind.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.020]   But a key feature of this map is that while it is very,
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:54.520]   very complex underneath, what emerges from that complexity
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.880]   gets simpler and simpler, especially as we move
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.820]   towards places of better health
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.420]   and more effectiveness in life.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.260]   So if you would, could you describe the map
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.780]   in a bit more detail, especially what's down there
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.140]   in these pillars, the complex stuff and the stuff
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.220]   that we should be looking at.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.860]   And then we'll touch on some of those cupboards
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.600]   that we all have and the sorts of questions
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.260]   that we should all be asking in the context
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.400]   of some common challenges, but also some very common
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.320]   and very effective paths to doing and feeling better.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.580]   - Yes, yes.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.660]   The unconscious mind is the place to start.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:36.180]   That's the deepest level of the structure of self.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:41.180]   So imagine sitting on top of a biological supercomputer
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.220]   the size of a house, right?
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.220]   That's what's going on inside of us, right?
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.380]   The unconscious mind is that biological supercomputer.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.820]   And if we're interested in ourselves, right,
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.340]   we become very, very curious about what is going on in it.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.780]   And that's where even though it's not directly accessible
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.000]   to us, it can be accessible through other ways,
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.300]   such as we talked about reflection or therapy,
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.780]   and of course there are other ways too,
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.420]   but it is accessible to us.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.120]   And we want to know what is in it
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:17.020]   because what is in it has such a strong effect
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.180]   on what's going on in our conscious mind, right?
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:25.180]   That's the person on top of the biological supercomputer
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.140]   the size of a house, or the image we've been using
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.920]   is the top of the iceberg that's coming out of the water.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.760]   So we can look at that either way,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.900]   but what is in it has of course a huge effect
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.340]   on the part that we're aware of, our conscious mind.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.660]   And I think the best analogy here,
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.700]   and it's actually I think quite an analogy
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.460]   that parallels very well is to an abscess
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.520]   in the field of physical medicine.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.140]   So an abscess is an area of walled off infection, right?
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.380]   So imagine that there's some infection, for example,
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.140]   it's often in the abdomen, okay?
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.020]   There's some infection and that infection
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.500]   could be really dangerous, right?
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.860]   If that infection spread, boy, it could go to the blood,
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.940]   the person could die from that, right?
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.900]   So the body does a really good job
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.540]   of walling off that infection, right?
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.360]   And that's a good thing, right?
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.540]   Because if the infection weren't walled off,
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.800]   it poses huge risk.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.740]   But the walled off infection
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.960]   does not represent a condition of health.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.580]   So someone who has an abscess in them and doesn't know it,
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.660]   this happens frequently in medicine.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.020]   We see people coming to emergency rooms
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.220]   and they have a low grade fever
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.140]   and they've had a low grade fever for a while
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.420]   and they just don't feel good.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.860]   And they have low energy and they're not sleeping well.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.860]   And they find themselves sweating a lot.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.820]   There are pervasive experiences going on
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.380]   that are really detracting from life,
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.740]   like not feeling great all the time,
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.980]   even though the person doesn't feel really sick.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.480]   That's sometimes why it takes a while
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.260]   for the person to come to medical attention.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.420]   So what's going on is better than not being walled off,
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.420]   but it is not synonymous with health.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.580]   So what happens in physical medicine?
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.900]   Abscess is identified and then someone goes in,
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.420]   the surgeon goes in and drains it.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.300]   And then the person is better, right?
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.500]   Think about that process.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.820]   Like surgery, surgery is not like a fun thing, right?
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.360]   There's anesthesia, there's recovery, right?
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.600]   But surgery is great when it cures the problem, right?
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.580]   So it's not that, oh, the physician in the emergency room
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.960]   or the family practice doc who identifies
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.520]   that there's an abscess, refer to the surgeon,
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.100]   everything is great and happy and they're better.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.840]   No, they have to go have a surgery
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.940]   and that's not an easy thing, right?
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.200]   But if they go and do that on the other side,
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.560]   the infection actually is gone.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:53.540]   So they do not have the symptoms
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.560]   that was constantly spinning off inside of them.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.540]   And they also don't have the risk
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.820]   that maybe that infection gets out of the abscess
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.540]   and their life is then at risk.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:08.720]   So the parallel is looking into the unconscious mind
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   to what is inside of us that may be acting like that abscess.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.660]   Even though this is an analogy, it is not theoretical.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.840]   Like this happens all the time.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.440]   And the abscess inside that person emotionally
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.560]   may be the bullying that went on
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.800]   right around the time of puberty, right?
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.180]   It may be that awful boss who was just so mean
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.900]   and took that good job away from me, right?
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.840]   It might be that.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.700]   It might be that assault that I don't wanna think about
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.460]   that's really still with me.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.640]   It might be that death I still feel guilty about.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.100]   I don't know what it is, right?
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.600]   But if there's an abscess in there,
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   we want to understand it and then fix it, cure it, right?
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.200]   And that's what the therapy process can do.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.100]   And that's why at times the therapy is unpleasant.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.060]   The crying and the anger,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.640]   that's the parallel of going through the surgery, right?
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.220]   But on the other side,
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.880]   we've dissipated the energy inside of it.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.120]   Like we've taken care of it.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.560]   And that's why it is so important
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.880]   to go into the unconscious mind
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.840]   if there are things that are really troubling us
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.540]   or if we don't know what's going on
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.220]   to cast a net of inquiry that may lead us there
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.040]   because trauma is so common
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.560]   and we shove trauma underneath the surface
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.780]   because of the guilt and shame that it generates.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.940]   And then it stays in us like an abscess
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.300]   and spins off symptoms.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.180]   They could be symptoms of diffidence.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.800]   They could be symptoms of overusing a substance.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.020]   They could be symptoms of avoiding good things in our life,
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.360]   but they're pervasive symptoms
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.140]   that are really harmful to us
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.540]   that we can understand and fix.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.720]   - In addition to quality therapy,
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   what are some other ways to access the unconscious?
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.840]   Earlier, we were talking about journaling
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.540]   and spelling out one's life narrative
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.200]   in written or in spoken form,
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.360]   either alone or with a trusted other.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.620]   Let's assume that somebody either can't afford
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.100]   or is just not at the place
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.680]   where they're willing to do therapy yet.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.160]   But they fully adopt this abscess model
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.180]   that or this abscess analogy that you described,
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.240]   which I think is an exceptional one
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.820]   because A, you have the 20 plus years of clinical experience
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:40.560]   knowing this exists, but also I think we all at some level
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.940]   can understand that there's stuff happening within us
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.860]   that we can't explain.
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.860]   And I, as a neuroscientist can absolutely say
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.760]   that most of the neural machinery in your head
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.820]   and the parts of it that are in your body,
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.580]   we don't have access to it.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.500]   We love to think that we do, but we don't.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.680]   It's just clicking away under there.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.000]   So let's say somebody wants to make some progress,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.120]   really improve their level of mental health,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.040]   obtain more agency and gratitude,
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.320]   improve all aspects of their life and the generative drive.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.360]   What are some ways that they can start to tap
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.600]   into the unconscious?
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.540]   And my guess is, if it's not in therapy,
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.580]   it's going to be by looking at some,
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.280]   in some of these other cupboards as you're describing them.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.560]   - Right, yes.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.920]   Develop and embrace curiosity about yourself, right?
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.920]   And if you can, go for that curiosity being dispassionate.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:39.200]   In the sense that, you talk about these files you have
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.560]   with your, with memories and events from your past,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.480]   that's so good, right?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.720]   Because you're exploring your life, right?
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.560]   So someone who wants to understand themselves better,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.920]   do that for yourself.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.640]   Go look at pictures, talk to people you knew
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.360]   at different stages of life,
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:59.420]   reflect upon how you behaved at different stages of life,
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.080]   what you felt inside, anchor yourself to memories
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.720]   and then extrapolate from there,
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.520]   become curious about yourself.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.520]   And if you can be dispassionate,
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.960]   this idea that sometimes gets called an observing ego,
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.840]   right, there are other words to put to it,
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.440]   but it's not ego in a negative sense, right?
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.220]   Here, it means the ability to stand outside of oneself
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.120]   and go, huh, right?
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.360]   And to really think about oneself
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.640]   without the negative emotion,
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.200]   we're often able to either see the trauma, for example,
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.160]   or see the change, like, huh,
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.120]   why did I go from feeling really good about myself?
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.200]   And I felt like I could do anything
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.520]   and then just a couple of years later,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.000]   man, look at me, I'm mopey in the pictures
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.360]   and then think, yeah, I was drinking more,
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.680]   I stopped taking care of myself,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.040]   like that's a pretty big change, right?
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.520]   And then, so now like we're calling attention,
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.480]   what's that change?
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.900]   And a lot of times the person knew it,
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.440]   you know, like, oh, I got rejected,
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.120]   I had that terrible breakup, right?
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.680]   And like, they knew it was a terrible breakup
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.480]   but they keep shoving it under the surface.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.960]   Maybe they didn't know it was a terrible breakup.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.280]   Maybe they can't figure out what it is, like, that's okay.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.880]   Even if they recognize, look, there was a change,
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.960]   then that will put the lie
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.560]   to what in this example is likely going on.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.520]   So that person likely frames themselves
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.140]   in a way that is very negative and always was true, right?
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.840]   So, I can never achieve anything, I never feel good,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.360]   no one likes me, I can't find a partner,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.080]   whatever it is we say to ourselves,
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.520]   the person, it's always been that way, right?
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.960]   Because the negative emotion is so strong
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.920]   and that part of our brain
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.840]   doesn't care about the clock and the calendar,
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.080]   and then the person goes back
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.000]   and thinks it was not always that way, right?
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.780]   And it comes to this a lot in therapy,
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.940]   doesn't have to be, as you said, in therapy,
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.040]   but no, you know, I was a go-getter, right?
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.220]   I'm thinking of the person who said I was a go-getter
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.680]   and I went out there and did things
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.720]   which put the lie to her saying that she was lazy,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.800]   incapable, all those things that were not true,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.040]   but she accepted as truth, right?
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.240]   So, she needed, from that mathematical perspective,
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.600]   like to go back and question the givens, right?
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.520]   From our perspective, we're saying,
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.960]   go look in the unconscious mind,
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   go look in that part of the pillar of the structure of self.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.480]   Go look there, that's the deepest part,
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.940]   the most complicated part,
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.200]   but it doesn't mean we can't understand it.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.360]   And if we start to gain understanding,
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.900]   then we can think more about the conscious mind,
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.200]   like, wait a second, what am I thinking about?
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.840]   What do I think about that, right?
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.080]   Have I really thought about this
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.520]   or is it just running over and over in my head?
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.400]   What would I like to do about it?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.720]   Maybe I'd like to learn more.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.560]   Maybe I wanna go get a book that I think could help me,
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.600]   listen to another podcast that could help me,
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.920]   talk to a friend, like maybe I wanna do those things.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.120]   So now, the flow between the unconscious mind
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.040]   and the conscious mind, right, becomes much more robust
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.760]   and that lets us look further, right?
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.820]   To look at the next level up, the defense mechanisms
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.240]   that grow up out of the unconscious mind
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.720]   and we can have some understanding of them
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.640]   even though they're unconscious, right?
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.080]   So the idea of when something shifted in me,
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.360]   how did my way of engaging with the world kind of change?
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.480]   You know, like I was perseverant and, you know,
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.020]   I would take some of that energy in me that wasn't so good
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.320]   and I could put it into like exercising,
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.240]   taking care of myself and then, you know,
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.600]   then that sort of shifted
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.080]   and I became sarcastic and cynical
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.800]   and, you know, I started avoiding, you know,
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.700]   those of my friends who are really taking care of themselves
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.840]   and doing well because that made me feel worse about myself.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.600]   So that's a dialogue that is reflective
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.020]   of defense mechanisms.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.220]   Now, the person isn't gonna necessarily say,
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.360]   oh, I used a lot of sublimation which is good
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.320]   and then I started using reaction formation and avoidance,
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.740]   just as an example, right?
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:54.360]   But they're gonna understand that in words that they can,
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.040]   whatever words they put to it,
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.460]   they understand that there was a change.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.720]   They can start putting, they put words to that.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.640]   They can understand that process of change.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.000]   It's not opaque, they're shining light on it
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.900]   and now they can gain a better understanding of it
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.880]   and they can change it.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.760]   Even that realization that I was much more functional,
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.140]   things were different.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.820]   I mean, that can be a treasure trove of very relevant,
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.840]   very important and very positive information
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.340]   to bring to the current situation.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.620]   - I think we often romance the idea of the person
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:29.500]   who can just live life forward, who doesn't look back,
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.820]   who just doesn't really explore their past,
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.940]   is just action-oriented because after all,
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:34.980]   when we wake up in the morning,
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:38.580]   all we can control is our actions going forward.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.180]   We can't rescript the actions of past, ours or others.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.620]   - That is such a good point of what happens
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.140]   when we're just looking forward, right?
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:53.060]   We become like a sprinter who comes out of the blocks too fast.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.740]   So if you think about the beginning of a 100 meter dash,
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.300]   they're the best sprinters in the world, say,
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.020]   and there they are in the blocks.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.780]   And if they come out of those blocks in the right way,
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.280]   they will gain momentum, they will keep their form
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.720]   and they will run as fast as they can.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.140]   But if they do not pay attention to what is behind them,
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.660]   the blocks that are supporting their body,
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.460]   the whole bigger picture here of the limitations
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:19.660]   within the body, right?
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.660]   They have to know what those limitations are.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.540]   They have to understand themselves.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.580]   That's how they avoid coming out of the block so fast
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.140]   and then sprawling headlong onto the track.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.960]   And we see that happen too.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.980]   So if we're just looking forward and thought and idea,
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.840]   that's how to live life, we will be tripping forward.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.700]   And ultimately we'll be like that sprinter,
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.540]   no matter how great a sprinter,
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.540]   if you come out of the blocks too fast,
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:43.980]   you're gonna trip forward.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.820]   - Yes, I know I said this in a different form
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.780]   a few minutes ago, but I think a lot of people
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   are afraid of self-inquiry because they just don't want
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.660]   the thing that they discover,
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:00.180]   which resides in their unconscious, the abscess, if you will,
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.380]   or the damaging thought or thing that happened,
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.760]   which they are aware of, but are pushing down,
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.160]   to take over their daily life in a way
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.620]   that doesn't allow them to be at least as functional
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.620]   as they are in the moment.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.300]   - If you go visit the person who had the abscess
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.140]   cured by the surgeon on post-op day one,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.660]   that person will be less functional, right?
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.680]   They'll be in a hospital bed, right?
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.860]   They won't be able to get up out of the bed,
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.980]   they won't be able to exercise, they're gonna feel,
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.000]   they're not gonna feel their best, right?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.700]   That's okay, right?
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.360]   It is okay that we at times can become intermittently say,
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.620]   less functional, right?
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.020]   In the sense that we're more upset
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.100]   that I'm spending more time crying, right?
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:44.380]   That's okay, because that's part of the energy,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.660]   the effort, the choice that gets us to a better place.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.260]   - Okay, so it's clear to me why exploring
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.780]   the unconscious mind can be and really is immensely valuable.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.620]   It's just, I'm convinced.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.460]   And I can't imagine anyone out there who would disagree
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:04.980]   with the idea that getting better mentally,
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.500]   being able to function better in the world as a consequence
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   is not a terrific use of one's time.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.420]   Even if it, you know, at the surface seems to take us
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.280]   off course a bit in the moment or not for even a few days.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.540]   And I think it's also worth highlighting
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.940]   that it's not the case that if we do an exploration
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.940]   of the unconscious mind or look in any of these cupboards
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.200]   for that matter, that our entire day
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.660]   is going to be overtaken by it,
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.500]   or all of our sleep is going to disappear.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.660]   I mean, we're not talking about a process
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:40.580]   in which everything is devoted to exploring these cupboards.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.860]   I mean, there are instances, of course,
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.260]   where someone hits a crisis and they simply can't function.
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.720]   But in that case, the thing they absolutely need to do
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.460]   is to look in these cupboards.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:51.180]   What are some ways that we can explore this other cupboard
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.560]   under the pillar of structure of self,
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.120]   which is the cupboard of the conscious mind?
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.140]   - So we can also approach this
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.780]   through the curiosity of self.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.340]   We do a lot of things automatically, right?
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.840]   That we can stop and think about.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.580]   Like, why do I do that thing, right?
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.060]   And it's amazing what that can provide, right?
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.660]   So for example, I'm working with a person
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:20.780]   who has been going to work for a long, long, long, long,
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.320]   long, long time, right?
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.900]   Didn't need to go to work a long time ago, right?
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.580]   And there's so many other things
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.100]   this person wants to do with their life.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.460]   They're curious about things.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.480]   They want to spend more time
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.700]   with the older people in their family, right?
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:39.220]   They had to stop and think, why am I going to work, right?
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.500]   Now, he's fortunate enough that he doesn't have to.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.280]   He also earned, you know, he started working.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.840]   He's diligent, he's fortunate,
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.220]   but he hadn't thought about it.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.880]   He's been going to work automatically for a long time.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.220]   And it was the thinking about it that made him realize,
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.180]   well, I do that automatically.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.000]   Now, why?
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.840]   Because it's rooted in unconscious things,
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.480]   but that he's now bringing to the conscious mind, right?
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.540]   Because I value hard work and I value diligence.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.460]   But him stop working doesn't mean
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.580]   that he's not innately hardworking or diligent,
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.620]   but he showed that for years and years and years.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.100]   And he can show it in other ways,
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.360]   like by, you know, he wants to be attentive
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.660]   to the older people who need help.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.500]   Like there's a lot he can do,
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.340]   but he had to go back and look.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.940]   And then of course there's a reason
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.020]   why he didn't realize it, right?
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.540]   And even though it's not even a bad reason,
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.700]   but clearly there was then an overvalue
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.780]   of hardworking, diligent, and he didn't realize,
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.180]   oh, like I've done that, right?
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.900]   Like I've done enough that I've convinced myself,
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.820]   like I know I'm hardworking, I know I'm diligent.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.960]   It's okay, I don't have to sort of serve
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.060]   that internal master anymore and then I can step away.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.640]   And now his whole life has changed,
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.900]   but how the change come about by asking what one might think
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.100]   is such a simple question to make no sense.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.320]   Like why do I go to work each day?
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.880]   Why have I been going?
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.020]   He's off on the road to change.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.020]   So it's one aspect of how we can explore the conscious mind.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.700]   It often leads us back to the unconscious mind, right?
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.540]   But it's awareness of our conscious choices, right?
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.580]   We can also then use tactics.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.180]   So for example, cognitive behavioral tactics,
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.660]   like thought redirection, like if I'm aware that,
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.240]   hey, there's a thought that comes into my mind a lot
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.880]   and I start learning ways I can redirect away from it
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.260]   instead of thinking about it a hundred times, right?
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.340]   And if I learn how to do that,
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.000]   there's less sort of negative emotion
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.460]   that comes from thinking about it
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.500]   and I can start to feel better, right?
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.620]   It's the basic premise of it.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.300]   But these are techniques that can really help us
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.220]   and they involve understanding and guiding
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.320]   the conscious mind.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.220]   - I'm smiling because I'm recalling an experience I had.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.240]   I have a female friend who's a very impressive person,
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.700]   really, as over-comaton,
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.420]   is a recovered alcoholic for many years
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:56.060]   and takes, at least by my read, great care of herself
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.140]   and the other people around her
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.880]   and has a spectacular sense of humor
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.900]   and a bunch of other things.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.260]   But it was probably five, six years ago
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.740]   that we were in conversation about something
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:07.500]   I don't recall what, and out of apparently nowhere,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.040]   she said, "I hate being busy."
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.720]   And it just stopped me in my tracks
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.220]   because I'm somebody who keeps very, very busy.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.140]   My schedule is extremely full
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.580]   with things that I really enjoy,
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.460]   some things I don't enjoy or enjoy less,
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.560]   but fortunately at this point in my life,
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.380]   mostly things that I enjoy.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:29.140]   At the time, I was very, very busy with many things,
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.940]   including many things I didn't enjoy.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.100]   And her statement just halted me.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:38.820]   And I realized, maybe I don't have to be busy.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.860]   Like this whole notion of doing a bunch of things
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:41.680]   I don't want to do.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.660]   Like, sure, we have to make our way in the world
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.100]   and make a living and take care of ourselves and others.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.500]   But I realized that there was a lot of extra stuff
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   that I was doing.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.180]   - Right, 'cause I think what she meant
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.940]   and what you were reflecting on was,
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.780]   I hate being automatically busy, right?
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.740]   It's not good to be automatically busy.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.920]   And then it makes you think about,
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.420]   wait, how am I busy in ways that are good for me?
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.260]   And how am I busy in ways that are not?
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.860]   Am I just taking up time to avoid something?
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.500]   You start really thinking about it.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.300]   - Yes, and the conversation stays with me to this day
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.700]   because up until then,
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.940]   I never really thought about the possibility
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.260]   that some or a lot of the things I was doing
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.660]   were truly a waste of my time.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.500]   Like mostly because I could be putting that energy
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.540]   into generative things, right?
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.980]   Generative tribes, things that would bring me
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.420]   agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, delight,
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.640]   these sorts of things.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.180]   What I'm giving as an example,
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.620]   I realize is quite different than sitting down in a chair
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.940]   and asking oneself questions about oneself
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.140]   and one's schedule and what one's doing.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.060]   - Same end point, right?
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.500]   - But, right, same end point.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.580]   And I bring it up because I think it was the fact
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.540]   that it stopped me in my tracks,
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.940]   but also the fact that I can't seem to forget it.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.620]   That means that it must have had significance.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.200]   And I would say that has had significance.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.100]   Because I think most people are familiar
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.220]   with seeing these news articles that come out,
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.240]   woman or man, 104 reflects on what really mattered in life.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.200]   And it's almost always the same things.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.580]   It's like close relationships.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.820]   No one on their death bed says,
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.300]   I wish I spent more time at work.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.500]   I might be one exception.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.720]   I actually really enjoy my work.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.140]   So whenever I see that one, I always think,
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.260]   no, like my life without my life's work,
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.520]   it would have been a diminished life for me.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.320]   I think there are others out there as well.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.620]   But I think it's very hard for us to place ourselves
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.740]   into the future of a person on our death bed,
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.460]   looking back and then make really good decisions now.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.520]   I think there are ways to do that,
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.140]   but it seems that it's far more powerful
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.020]   to just think about what am I doing now
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.640]   and make some, you know, and come to some realizations
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.980]   about what is really a value now
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.620]   and what is of less value or no value now,
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.500]   and then make adjustments now,
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.620]   as opposed to doing the death bed exercise.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.200]   - You have no other option if you're gonna make change.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   I mean, think about what a complicated
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.040]   and ultimately meaningless exercise it is
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.660]   to try and project ahead into a future
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.740]   when one is on one's death bed.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.340]   And it's like, what is that like?
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.640]   Like, I mean, we can't imagine that,
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.700]   and we don't know who's there,
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.380]   like whatever that situation may be for any of us,
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.060]   it's not gonna be what we imagine.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.220]   So then we just make something up
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.900]   and we try and what, extrapolate our lives
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.180]   in a way that gets us to this place
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.620]   where we're on our death bed and we're not unhappy.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.960]   Okay, it just brings us right back to the future,
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.220]   like, because it's actually simple, right?
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.780]   That is so complicated.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.120]   What are things gonna be like on our death bed?
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.000]   What will happen between now and then?
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.020]   All things I don't know, so it's impossibly complicated.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.980]   So then you take it back to the present, right?
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.220]   Like, what is it I'm choosing?
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.560]   I am the I right now that is moving through time
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.140]   or is on the luge of life or whatever we wanna say.
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.840]   So what am I choosing right now?
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.380]   That's how we make our lives better.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:04.820]   And we're aware, of course.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.700]   I know there's a future.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.180]   I wanna lead towards a better future.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.580]   I can't, I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.520]   I can't envision what that's gonna be,
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.940]   but I can do my best now to guide my life as best I can.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.000]   And that's gonna have to lead me to the best future,
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.480]   whatever all the variables are that I don't know yet.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.320]   - The next cupboard under the pillar of structure of self
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.600]   is defense mechanisms.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.880]   I have several questions about defense mechanisms,
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.920]   but the first question is,
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.380]   can we be aware of our defense mechanisms
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.360]   and is there value in that?
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.200]   And if so, which defense mechanisms are accessible to us?
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.280]   And I guess the third question would be,
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.040]   how does one go about exploring defense mechanisms?
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.160]   - Well, it's sort of fantastical imagery, right?
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.720]   That there's this iceberg, right?
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.080]   Part is underwater, part is above water.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.960]   And then from the part that's underwater
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.680]   come these sort of branches, right?
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.120]   So the way I imagine it is there are branches of ice
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.680]   that can be clear and have light pass through them
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.160]   in a way that has high fidelity, right?
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.000]   Or they can be sort of twisted and unclear
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.100]   and they distort the light that passes through them.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.980]   Now they rise up from the unconscious mind,
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.760]   meaning defenses are unconscious, they're automatic,
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.360]   but they're not outside of our ability
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.000]   to go looking for them, right?
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.580]   They're in the unconscious mind.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:30.080]   So it's not that we can't understand them,
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.180]   it's that they're elusive
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.420]   and there has to be a process of inquiry,
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.920]   but we can learn about them
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.260]   just like we can learn about other things
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:38.960]   in the unconscious mind.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.900]   And here again, knowledge is power.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:45.040]   So I'm not gonna learn anything new
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.260]   or I'm unlikely to learn anything new
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.160]   about my defense mechanisms
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.600]   if I don't think about them, right?
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.760]   But if I start to think about them,
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.420]   then I can start to learn things and to draw conclusions.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:01.300]   How am I behaving now as opposed to before?
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.200]   Do I notice that like how I'm coping?
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.440]   We'll often think coping,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.360]   but coping is conscious, but we can access that.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.200]   How am I coping?
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.360]   What am I doing?
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.280]   And what does it mean?
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   So for example, someone who after some difficult experience
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.640]   then starts avoiding, right?
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.040]   Can be doing that without an awareness of it.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.420]   Avoidance is a defense.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.460]   So avoidance of situations or people
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.400]   or potential negative emotion, right?
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.840]   So self-reflection can help us understand
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.880]   which defense mechanisms we're using
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.560]   and what may have changed in us.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.520]   So an example, an example we see all the time
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.640]   is someone who say had as a primary defense mechanism
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.200]   sublimation before some difficult event.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.840]   Then the sublimation is taking energy,
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.700]   taking say excess aggression,
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.920]   turning it into something positive, right?
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.800]   It's a good way of handling distress within us.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.040]   So it's healthy, right?
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.200]   And now after some change in their life,
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.720]   they find that say they're drinking more
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.440]   and they're relying more and more on alcohol.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.080]   And you might say, well, there's soothing with alcohol.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.240]   Yes, there's soothing with alcohol in one sense,
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.040]   but what else might that mean, right?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.760]   And oftentimes what you'll see
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.480]   is maybe the person is using alcohol
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.400]   because they're mad at someone, they're punishing someone,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.840]   that someone is probably them.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.760]   They get to have the short-term soothing
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.240]   but then to feel worse about themselves the next day, right?
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.520]   And the alcohol is in part a search for soothing
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.340]   but it's in part an acting out against the self,
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.820]   which is a different kind of defense mechanism
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.400]   that is not healthy.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.040]   So the process of reflection or of inquiry
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.160]   can help us understand the branches
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.860]   that are coming up from the iceberg,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.180]   from the unconscious mind.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.800]   How are they in me?
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.460]   Are they arranged in a way that's sort of elegant
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.360]   and they're clear and the light is passing through them?
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.340]   Or are there things that have become sort of twisted?
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.600]   Okay, what is that?
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.120]   What exactly is that?
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.380]   How do I go change that, right?
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.120]   I don't want that branch that is sort of opaque
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.860]   and that the light can't get through or is distorted.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.880]   So I can go look at that
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.040]   because even though defense mechanisms are unconscious,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.960]   if I'm working on myself,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.700]   I can take away that, so to speak, diseased branch, right?
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.480]   Or that branch that's not healthy
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.100]   and put in its place something healthier.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.920]   That's how we can change our defensive structure, right?
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.600]   Those branches of our defense mechanisms
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.100]   because even though they're unconscious, right,
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.520]   we can reflect on them, bring them to consciousness
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.220]   and then bring ourselves to bear to make ourselves healthier
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.280]   and it can indeed get healthier.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.840]   And as it gets healthier,
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.800]   it affects the next level around it,
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.200]   which is the person's character structure.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.240]   So remembering, we're using fantastical imagery, right?
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.840]   Because around the iceberg, blowing above the water
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.340]   and the branches that come out
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.520]   of the part of the iceberg under the water
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.160]   and how they array themselves,
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.340]   we're imagining that there's a nest
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.020]   that's encompassing all of that,
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.100]   the unconscious mind, the conscious mind,
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.560]   the defense mechanisms,
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.500]   and that nest is the character structure.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:18.500]   It's a way that we contain and define the self
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.220]   that rides on top of everything.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.360]   It is into that nest that the self settles
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.900]   and from which the self grows
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.420]   because the character structure,
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:32.200]   it's more than just the conscious mind.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.100]   It's sort of the conscious mind in action,
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.760]   the defense mechanisms in action,
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.120]   all the things that are going on underneath the surface
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.520]   and the unconscious mind in action.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.880]   And then that's how we be.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.800]   You think be as an active word, right?
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.560]   That's how we are or that's how we actively be in the world,
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.520]   how we're engaging with the world.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.480]   - So you described the character structure as the nest
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.800]   that is up above the surface of the water
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.560]   and that includes things like these unconscious defenses
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.320]   and all other aspects of what comes from below.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.120]   Then you also said that the self,
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.280]   our selves reside in that nest.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.560]   And you, and I don't recall the exact wording,
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.780]   but you said something to the extent of,
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:22.860]   the self grows within that nest.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.560]   And as you said that I immediately had the image in mind
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.240]   of a nest that is either incredibly nurturing
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.340]   and can really foster the self in its best ways
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.520]   and can give rise to empowerment, humility,
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.400]   agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, delight,
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.300]   generative drive, all these wonderful things.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.740]   I also imagined a nest that isn't as clean as it could be,
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.040]   or that has some holes in it,
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.260]   or that isn't stable in the wind and these sorts of things.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.880]   Is that sort of imagery that's coming to mind for me,
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.600]   is that a decent way to conceptualize this?
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.400]   - Yes, and I think it is a very important point.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.560]   The self nests in the character structure.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.260]   And from nesting in the character structure, it grows.
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:15.260]   We are the self that grows from within that nest.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.280]   And that tells us a couple of things.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.600]   One, I am something now.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.800]   Right now, the things I've done, the things I've thought,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.760]   the things that have happened to me,
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.300]   like there's a self now.
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.760]   So one might think then, what grows out of the nest, right?
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.040]   Is what I am now.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.800]   Hence the concept of acceptance of self.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.840]   That's what I am now, right?
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   But I am also responsible for tending what is growing.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.720]   I'm responsible for weeding it, right?
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.820]   I'm responsible for planting healthy seeds in it.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.160]   And I think that captures the truth
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.720]   of the acceptance of ourselves.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.160]   This is what I am now.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.060]   This is who I am now.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:03.840]   But isn't it beautiful that I can tend and nurture it?
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.800]   And we know, as you'd commented,
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.120]   what happens if you don't tend it?
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.420]   There's a lot of weeds.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:09.580]   Things aren't going well.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:10.800]   Things start to get unstable.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.360]   I mean, that's not good.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.680]   And we can go that way too, right?
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.960]   That's where agency, gratitude,
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.020]   part of how it all cycles through, right?
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.780]   Because our unconscious mind is still working.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.680]   Like it's all still happening.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:29.080]   And that's how we tend that garden of the self, so to speak.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.760]   That's how we best tend it so that what grows up from it
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.180]   is a self that we recognize
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:39.260]   in the way that we want to recognize ourselves.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.160]   We see a self that we can feel proud of.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.000]   We see a self that we understand
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.280]   well enough to guide forward.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.120]   We see a self for which we have enough respect
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.100]   and humility within us to understand
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.160]   that we don't understand everything.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.540]   And it's from that self that we engage with the world.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.660]   - I've heard many times before,
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:04.380]   kind of in the circles of psychology and self-help
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   and elsewhere, that we need to all learn
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:13.300]   to mother and father ourselves to some extent.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.440]   And I'm not a developmental psychologist,
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.400]   but my understanding is that the unconscious mind,
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.640]   the conscious mind, our defense mechanisms,
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.540]   the character structure, all the stuff
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.240]   that makes up the nest, which the self resides,
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.420]   and hopefully can grow our,
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.380]   at least at some stage of life, perhaps all stages of life,
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:35.720]   determined by genetics and by how we were raised,
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.140]   nature and nurture.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.560]   But this phrase, we have to learn to parent ourselves,
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.840]   it is thrown around a lot these days,
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.140]   certainly on social media, but elsewhere too.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.820]   And oftentimes that brings to mind sort of stereotypes
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.140]   of mothering and fathering.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.060]   And these stereotypes break down quite a bit these days.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:57.700]   Things like, we have to be nurturing to ourselves,
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.980]   self-respect, self-love, self-protection, right?
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:03.140]   Healthy self-protection and these kinds of things.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.620]   And all of that sounds fine and good,
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:09.740]   but it's always seemed rather vague to me.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:12.560]   Like, if I'm telling myself I'm okay,
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.660]   or is that mothering and fathering myself?
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.500]   I don't know.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:20.940]   I mean, it doesn't seem as concrete as perhaps I would like
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:21.820]   and others would like,
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:26.100]   because it's not spelling out to specific actionables.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:30.020]   What you're describing here makes so much more sense to me,
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.220]   even though some of these concepts are a bit abstract,
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.260]   because the idea of this nest in which the self resides
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.340]   and emerges from character structure,
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.100]   one can immediately see why it's so valuable
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.060]   and it's such a key component of mental health
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.880]   and self-care to tend to that nest.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   And written into that is the fact that the nest is malleable,
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.500]   that we really can make changes, right?
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.920]   That we can create a better internal environment
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.660]   for ourself by going through these cupboards.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:04.280]   - You're pointing out another crucial factor here,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.720]   which is if I am the garden of self
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.220]   that grows up from all of it,
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.880]   and I am responsible for tending the garden,
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.200]   I'm also responsible for tending to the whole structure.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.220]   And that's so important.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.140]   If I'm going to take care of myself
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:23.380]   in the ways that we've talked about,
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.260]   I'm gonna tend not just to the garden that's growing out
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.100]   that I can see on the surface,
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.660]   but I'm going to attend to all of me,
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.700]   to the entire structure of self.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:37.100]   An example here that I think can illustrate it pretty well
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:41.100]   is, so imagine a person who's doing well.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.860]   The part of the iceberg under the water is solid, right?
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.740]   The consciousness on top is solid.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.200]   The defense mechanisms are clear.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.260]   The nest is good.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.260]   The garden of self is flourishing.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:54.020]   And then there's a significant trauma to that person.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.460]   There's a car accident.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.420]   Someone is hurt.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.300]   There's a death of someone around them.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:59.700]   They have a serious illness.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.300]   They lose a job, right?
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.620]   It can even be they spent too much time contemplating
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.640]   and looking at news from murders around the world
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.360]   and all the awful things that we can spend too much time
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.600]   with something traumatic
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.540]   then goes into the unconscious mind, right?
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.940]   The trauma happens.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.060]   And what often happens, not always,
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:22.220]   but what very often happens is the guilt and shame
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.380]   that are raised causes to push the trauma
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.700]   underneath the surface.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.960]   Now that's in the unconscious mind and it's impacting it.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.340]   And that stability is threatened, right?
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.640]   I mean, it's all riding on top of this giant part
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.740]   of the iceberg that's underneath the surface of the water.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.880]   And okay, we don't have to worry too much about it, right?
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.380]   If things are going well,
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.180]   but if it starts to get fragmented,
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.220]   it starts to shift,
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:49.660]   it threatens everything that rides on top of it,
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.980]   which is why taking care of ourselves means
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:57.380]   taking care of all elements of the structure of self.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:00.580]   - That all makes very clear why tending to the garden
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.680]   is so key and why we as individuals
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.060]   are really the people most fit to do this, right?
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.180]   Of course, when one can,
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.520]   that work should be done with somebody
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.980]   who's a really terrific clinician of guide that process
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.600]   and where one can't work with a clinician,
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.020]   one would hope that they would take
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.480]   a structured approach to this,
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.940]   which is really what we're talking about here
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.660]   and in the other episodes.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.820]   - Yeah, and keeping in mind,
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:28.740]   'cause you're keeping in mind that tending to the self
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:31.860]   means tending to the whole structure of self, right?
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:34.860]   If we keep that in mind, we won't go wrong, right?
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.300]   We'll pay attention to the surface,
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.780]   but we'll pay attention to the things
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.980]   that are under the surface.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.000]   We pay attention to the whole structure of self.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.500]   We will shepherd ourselves forward as best we can.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.040]   - I'd love for you to tell us about the function of self,
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.740]   the second pillar that resides alongside structure of self
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.700]   and that serves to geyser up
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.940]   into how we show up in the world,
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.540]   hopefully with empowerment, humility,
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.420]   agency, and gratitude, but sometimes no.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.040]   And as we've established,
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.900]   there is always, always, always tremendous value
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.900]   to exploring these cupboards.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:13.720]   So how does one go about exploring the different cupboards
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.680]   under the function of self?
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.700]   And we should probably start that conversation by saying,
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:20.260]   what are the cupboards under the function of self?
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:24.000]   - I'll start off by saying all the cupboards
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.200]   under the function of self
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.520]   will reference the structure of self, right?
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.360]   Which makes sense.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.960]   There's a structure and the function arises
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.860]   from the structure.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:34.320]   It's good for us to have that in mind
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.780]   as we're thinking about the elements
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:37.800]   of the function of self.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.240]   So the deepest element,
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.400]   let's say the bottom of the pillar, right,
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.620]   is self-awareness, right?
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.460]   The sense of an eye, right?
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:52.340]   On top of that, next up the pillar
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:56.060]   are defense mechanisms in action, right?
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.620]   Up from that is salience,
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.900]   what we're paying attention to inside and out.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.300]   The next level above that is behavior.
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:08.780]   And on top of that is our strivings.
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:12.120]   So if we go back to the bottom layer,
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.640]   the deepest, most complicated layer,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.780]   it's the sense of self-awareness, the sense of an eye.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.460]   And there are a lot of ways
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.480]   that we can foster self-awareness.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.380]   So like the unconscious mind in the structure,
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:31.260]   we can't just go there and fully understand what the eye is.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:34.780]   But we can do things that can really, really help us.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.840]   So for me, thinking about like,
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.140]   what am I and how am I navigating the world
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.780]   and having in mind the structure of self.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.300]   Like, wait, there's an unconscious mind
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.740]   working its way in me, there's my conscious mind.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:49.980]   Even being aware of the first pillar
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.200]   can be part of fostering the self-awareness
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.180]   of the second pillar.
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:57.780]   Another way that can happen is self-reflection.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:00.200]   For some people it can happen in meditation,
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.980]   contemplation of the self.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:05.740]   There are many ways that we can help ourselves understand
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.760]   that living is an active process,
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.120]   that idea of the luge of time
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.580]   and we're moving down it, it's an active process.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.940]   And that is the eye that I'm guiding through that process.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:22.380]   We can foster self-awareness in a number of ways,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:24.380]   but what we're trying to do here,
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.740]   the same as with the bottom of the structure of self-pillar,
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.540]   the most complicated parts,
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.180]   there's a lot that's unconscious,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.980]   there's a lot that's unknown to us.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:37.500]   So what we're trying to do is know some of it, right?
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.560]   And know more of it over time,
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.060]   bring some of those automatic or unconscious things
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.300]   to conscious awareness
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.240]   so that we can have a better understanding
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.080]   because if we have an understanding,
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.160]   we can utilize that to make everything better.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.000]   - I can see right off how this first cupboard
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.860]   of self-awareness and an exploration of the eye
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:00.180]   is so critical and realizing that we have a physical body,
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.300]   that we have agency in the world
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.180]   to do at least certain things.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.940]   And in an earlier episode, you mentioned a practice actually
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:13.140]   of looking in the mirror and focusing on this reality
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:15.580]   that we have a physical body, we reside in it,
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.960]   and then we have agency, we can do things in the world
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.060]   as a way to reinforce self-awareness.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.500]   Such an interesting practice
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.720]   and one that I started on immediately after.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.900]   Well, that evening, yeah.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.240]   And the next morning, after hearing it from you,
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.880]   some interesting things came to mind
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.220]   and I encourage people to try it.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.920]   It's done eyes open just for a few minutes or so,
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.280]   two, three minutes in my case.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.560]   Some interesting understanding came about,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.500]   especially when coupled with thinking about
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.320]   some of my life narrative and things that have happened.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.760]   So I highly recommend people explore this practice
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.700]   that you described.
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:53.780]   I'm also interested in the sorts of narratives
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:56.360]   that we have about ourselves.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.000]   I think everyone has narratives about what they're good at,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   what they're less good at, what's happened to them,
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.480]   why it's happened to them.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.280]   Could you tell us what you think about
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.360]   exploring our narratives, right?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.600]   Not just exploring the fact that we have a physical body,
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.020]   but exploring our stories about ourselves.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:20.120]   Well, self-awareness is just the awareness of an I, right?
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.480]   So we can use our conscious mind to help that.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.800]   So this aspect of function of self
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.560]   isn't about what the narrative means, right?
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.280]   That comes later.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.480]   This is about the awareness of an I.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.760]   So when you were talking about the narrative,
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.880]   you said something along the lines of like,
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.520]   there's stories and you're not thinking of like,
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.520]   oh, it's the same me in these stories.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.880]   If you approach the narrative in a different way,
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.220]   the awareness, like there's an I, right?
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:55.040]   There's a me, like I'm the point of all these stories, right?
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.280]   That's why they're here.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.340]   They're all in me in some way or another,
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.800]   because I remember them and they're important enough
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.240]   that I wrote them down.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.700]   If you look at it that way,
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.900]   where you're just apprehending an I, like, huh,
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:11.320]   there's a me to whom all of this applies.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.620]   That's how we can use the conscious mind and the narrative
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.400]   in order to foster self-awareness.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.120]   It's not yet about meaning.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.680]   It's about the awareness of an I.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.040]   - So it's actually much simpler
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.220]   than I'm making it out to be at some level.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.600]   - At that level, yes.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.960]   - Got it. - Yes.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.620]   - Okay, well then at some point we will return
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.600]   to this theme of narratives, narratives that serve us,
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.960]   perhaps narratives that don't serve us.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.120]   Meanwhile, take us into that second bin
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.680]   under the function of self,
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.060]   the defense mechanisms in action.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.240]   I find these infinitely fascinating.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.720]   And I think many other people do too,
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.240]   because sublimation, denial, these kinds of things,
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.520]   they really provide so much of what does
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.400]   and doesn't happen to each of us.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.020]   And yeah, so if you could tell us how we can think
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.320]   about our defense mechanisms in action
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.920]   in a way that can improve our health.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:07.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.740]   And of course, defense mechanisms are
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.840]   under the structure of mind.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.720]   Defense mechanisms in action are under function of mind.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:19.080]   They're unconscious processes that we can gain,
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.300]   sometimes a very good understanding of,
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.360]   by directing our conscious mind towards them.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.600]   And this is a place where we can use narratives, right?
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.160]   We can use an understanding of self.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.760]   So as an example, someone who's thinking about themselves
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.660]   and what they want to do for a living,
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.200]   if they want their job or where they want to live.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.240]   And you know, who's thinking about self can realize,
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:43.520]   you know, he's gonna feel good
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.240]   when I'm doing something for someone.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.800]   And we hear this a lot, especially people
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.600]   who then direct themselves towards helping professions.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.080]   Like, what did I like about that job?
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.160]   It wasn't that it had a great salary.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.040]   It wasn't that the hours were good, you know?
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.820]   I like that it was really helpful to people.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.960]   Or, you know, there were people that were underneath of me
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.640]   in the hierarchy that I could really kind of nurture, right?
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.140]   And I think, right, and I love putting food out
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:09.640]   for the birds and the squirrels.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.480]   Like, it can be a realization of self
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.480]   that guides us towards consciously apprehending
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.820]   and thinking about altruism as a defense mechanism, right?
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.320]   'Cause altruism is a defense.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.760]   It's a healthy defense where if you can do something good,
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.800]   you do something good, make something good,
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.820]   that's the end point of it.
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:31.560]   Like, you don't need that to translate into something else.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.760]   It's a defense mechanism.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.600]   It's a good one.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.860]   And you can certainly see how it fits with the good things
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.560]   we're trying to build on top of it.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.520]   And sometimes through that process of reflection,
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.560]   the person becomes aware of that.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.680]   They haven't chosen jobs by the obvious things
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.680]   that even they thought they chose jobs by.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.520]   Where's the job?
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.480]   What does it pay?
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.160]   It wasn't that, that what they really valued
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.480]   and what they then started choosing upon
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.960]   might've been something that they weren't aware of
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.000]   until they think about it,
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.280]   and that leads them to the defense mechanism.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.160]   The same way, another example could be rationalization,
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.000]   right?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.500]   Someone who thinks about their life and they think,
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:09.700]   you know, I always kind of tell myself
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.560]   something is better than it is, right?
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.880]   And then ultimately, I got disappointing myself.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.040]   You know, like I tell myself,
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.440]   like you're doing really well at work
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.040]   and you know, I'm not really working hard enough.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.400]   And then when I have that review, I feel lousy, you know?
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.440]   And that last person who broke up with me and said,
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.120]   you know, you just weren't being a reliable partner
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.280]   or, you know, that person was right, right?
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.400]   And that can lead to, oh, like what's going on?
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.040]   I always think things are going pretty well
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.160]   when they're not.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.960]   That's guiding us towards rationalization
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.200]   as a defense mechanism.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.920]   And again, a person doesn't have to say,
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.460]   ah, I conclude I'm using rationalization
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:48.840]   as a defense mechanism,
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.560]   but there can be words put to that
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.240]   of seeing a pattern in the self.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.480]   When this is done as part of therapeutic inquiry,
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.960]   we're often looking to identify the defense mechanisms
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.220]   and that can be great too, but it's not always needed, right?
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.880]   Defense mechanisms result in patterns, right?
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.920]   So if a person just sees the pattern,
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.600]   that can be enough to recognize the pattern
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.440]   and either say follow the pattern of altruism
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.880]   as a defense mechanism or how do we work against,
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.240]   how do I work against the pattern of rationalization
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.120]   as a defense mechanism?
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.560]   - Can we conclude that patterns that we don't like
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.760]   are the reflection of unhealthy defense mechanisms
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.960]   and that patterns that we like
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.480]   are the consequence of healthy defense mechanisms?
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.200]   - Usually, yes.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.900]   It's worth some thought and some reflection
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.440]   and putting together like what exactly
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.640]   are the pieces of that,
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.200]   but basically the answer to that is yes.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.280]   - In an earlier episode,
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:45.200]   you mentioned one defense mechanism in action
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.280]   that is often observed in people is acting out.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:53.160]   This immediately sounds like an unhealthy defense mechanism.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.080]   So to keep with this concept of the patterns
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.980]   are often more observable
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:02.880]   than are the underlying defense mechanisms,
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.080]   would it be the case, for instance,
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:08.280]   that if somebody has a repeated set of failures,
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   like that's a pattern or is repeatedly in friction
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.720]   in a particular relationship in their life,
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.180]   like maybe even just with one person,
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.940]   like all other relationships are going great,
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.220]   but then they're in a lot of friction
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:21.400]   with this one other person.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.220]   So there's a pattern.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:28.220]   From that pattern, they could explore what?
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:30.000]   I mean, is it important that they get
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   to a verbal identification of the defense mechanism
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.360]   or what sorts of steps would one take
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.400]   going from a recognition of the pattern
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.380]   to understanding of the defense mechanism,
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.120]   perhaps in a way that moves them forward?
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.820]   - The understanding of the defense mechanism
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:53.960]   can be very helpful, but isn't always needed, right?
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.720]   If you can recognize a maladaptive pattern,
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.600]   like, oh, this is happening a lot and it's not good for me,
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:04.960]   you become able to change that pattern, right?
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.280]   So understanding the defense can be helpful.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.120]   I mean, again, the more understanding, the better,
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.280]   but it's not always necessary.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.120]   Here, I think to understand the defense mechanism,
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.240]   we should first define acting out,
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.060]   because we think of acting out, just hearing the words,
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.800]   as something that's volitionally done, right?
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.440]   But that's not what we're talking about, right?
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.120]   Defense mechanisms are unconscious.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.320]   So there's an automaticity to the response
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.840]   that the person can see by reflection,
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.800]   because this isn't conscious choice to act out.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:36.640]   That's something different.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.540]   That's bad behavior, right?
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.040]   But what we're talking about here
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.320]   is the thing that's automatic and unconscious
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.760]   until we bring it into our conscious mind.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.720]   And acting out isn't always dramatic either.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   So here's one example, right?
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.680]   So let's say in a relationship situation, right?
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.920]   You have one person who always does the dishes.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.240]   The other person does something different, right?
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.120]   That person does the dishes, right?
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.640]   And it's onerous.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.840]   People have busy lives.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.660]   It's onerous to have to do a lot of dishes.
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:10.980]   And every time, like things aren't going so well,
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.660]   there's a little bit of conflict between them, right?
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:18.260]   The other person makes twice as many dirty dishes, right?
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.380]   This is exactly the kind of thing
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.860]   that happens in relationship situations
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:26.500]   where this little thing becomes a little crack in the door
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.420]   that opens more, and then there's a foot in the door,
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:30.000]   and now there's a big problem,
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.720]   because we act out in these ways that we're not aware of.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.080]   So again, the person isn't deciding I'm going to do that
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.620]   so that that person has to do more work,
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.680]   but there's an automaticity to it.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.240]   And upon reflection,
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.660]   sometimes a person could realize I'm doing that, right?
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:51.480]   Or, this is a real example, person who realizes
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.840]   I just make much more difficulties, right?
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:58.480]   Around the house, like I make a lot more difficulties
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.460]   for my partner, and was like, whoa.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.300]   You know, like this person
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:02.800]   doesn't want to be doing that, right?
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.700]   That's not, they love that person.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.300]   They don't want to be doing that.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.260]   But by realizing that when they can bring a process
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.060]   of change, of just being more self-aware,
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.380]   and saying, look, I don't want to do that.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:14.480]   I don't want that to be a defense anymore.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.020]   If I have conscious awareness, now I can control it.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.540]   And maybe that person is doing that other places.
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.380]   Maybe the person is, you know,
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:24.220]   it kind of goes that way at work, too.
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.980]   You know, I could contribute to a project
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.500]   and make something easier on a person,
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500]   and I realize I don't do that, right?
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:32.800]   If I'm feeling some negative way, then we can go find,
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.520]   okay, what might the roots of that be?
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.080]   For example, did a parent role model that behavior, right?
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.960]   Was that done to them?
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.000]   Were the parent was really good to them
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.520]   if they were behaving in the right way?
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.200]   And like, they make their breakfast, right?
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.480]   And if not, well, you know, you make it yourself.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.840]   Or, oh, sorry, there's no milk.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.240]   I mean, like these things happen,
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:55.280]   and then the person gets in them
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.800]   some array of circumstances, feelings, responses,
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.200]   all the stuff that goes on in the unconscious mind
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.160]   that then throws up to the surface
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.160]   this kind of acting out as a defense mechanism.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.640]   So I think it's important to point out,
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.500]   and it's a good example, because it is unconscious,
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:15.500]   and a lot of times how we're doing it is not dramatic.
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.520]   - What about salience?
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:20.360]   You know, this cupboard under the function of self
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.680]   that I think we are all too familiar with.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.520]   You know, like what we pay attention to
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.220]   internally and externally.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.880]   I have a sort of bizarre meditative practice
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.420]   that I've talked about before on the podcast.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.600]   I don't know why I came up with this,
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.460]   but it's more of a perceptual exercise
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.580]   that I do from time to time,
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.700]   where if I feel like I'm too in my head,
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:45.740]   I literally focus my visual attention outward.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:49.240]   I try and place it on a horizon or some object out there.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.500]   And other times, if I'm sort of in the world too much
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:54.760]   and I want to get back into myself,
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.800]   I'll close my eyes and do a moment or two
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.420]   or more traditional, what traditional mean,
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:01.800]   what people think of as meditation.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.140]   The practice involves setting aside a minute or two
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:09.880]   and deliberately stepping through a closed eye meditation.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.240]   Like just, it's not really meditation.
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:12.820]   Again, it's just recognizing I'm a self,
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:15.580]   like here contained within the skin of my body.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:17.600]   Then I open my eyes, I look at my hand.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.420]   This all sounds very silly as I describe it,
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.680]   but it's, and then I think about a bridge.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.220]   Like my perception can be split
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:26.580]   between my awareness of self internally and my hand.
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.140]   Then I look out some distance, 10, 12 feet or so,
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:32.580]   and do the same.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.180]   I sort of bridge self-awareness with external awareness.
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.500]   And I step out to the horizon.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.820]   And then I sometimes like to do the exercise of,
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.220]   it goes with a popular meme, you know,
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.220]   this we're just like this like pale blue dot.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:48.400]   I think about myself in right here,
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.700]   but then the fact that I'm a planet
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:53.320]   that's like spinning in a, you know, in space.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.600]   And then right back into myself.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.960]   And then I go about my day.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.040]   And I developed that a few years ago,
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.600]   more on the basis of what I know about visual perception
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.020]   and interoception, our recognition of inside
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.080]   versus extra reception, just fancy language for recognition
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.920]   and perception of what's outside.
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.140]   But that's my practice of orienting myself in life,
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.480]   because then I feel like I have better buffers
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.880]   against what happens around me
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:22.300]   and how much I'm reacting or not reacting.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.840]   That's my practice.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.360]   I have a feeling it touches into a few of these bins,
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.120]   but it certainly doesn't get it at, you know,
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.400]   approaching a specific problem
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.760]   or thinking about where problems might exist
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:39.800]   beneath the surface that I'm not aware of, right?
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.840]   - Because there's only one part of the equation, right?
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.520]   It's paying attention to saliency.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.900]   What you're doing then, you are grounding yourself
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:49.960]   in order to change salience, right?
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.560]   And that is a strategy.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.420]   You said, oh, maybe it's silly or this or that.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.320]   No, it's an understood and known strategy.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.180]   For example, variations of that are what people can do
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:02.140]   to prevent panic attacks, right?
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.300]   To change the salience.
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.320]   If the salience is I'm going inside of me
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.860]   and I'm feeling panicked
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:09.760]   and I just have a feeling of awfulness, right?
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.200]   You can change that salience by grounding yourself
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.700]   to the world around you, right?
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:16.160]   We tell people, place your hands on the table,
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.400]   look at the specifics of exactly what time it is.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.340]   Look at the shape of a doorknob, right?
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:24.000]   Ground yourself so that you can change salience.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.640]   Because now as we move up the hierarchy of function of self,
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.160]   we're getting to using the conscious mind, right?
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.040]   Things that are salient to us can be external,
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.560]   they can be internal, and if they're internal,
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.180]   they can be conscious and sometimes they're unconscious.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.180]   So it's not all about the conscious mind,
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.100]   but we're bringing the conscious mind to bear here
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:48.540]   to think about salience, which combined with everything else
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.960]   can help us see what's under the surface.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.720]   Most of the time what we're doing
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.920]   is that act of self observation, right?
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.420]   What is going on inside of me?
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:58.720]   Which can be, what am I thinking?
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.380]   This is how the person can realize over and over,
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:04.400]   oh my goodness, I'm saying to myself X,
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.600]   and for the first time they say out loud
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:09.000]   and realize the thing they've said to themselves
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.640]   10,000 times, right?
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:13.320]   Or it can be a feeling state, right?
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.020]   Wow, what's salient to me is a feeling state,
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:19.040]   let's say of vulnerability, and then everything
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.760]   seems threatening, right?
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.800]   So salience, it's a form of self awareness
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.360]   that we could say is using the conscious mind now
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.080]   to tend to that garden of self, right?
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:31.820]   To look at that garden of self and say,
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:33.960]   what's really growing from it, right?
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.680]   Is it all things I like, right?
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.100]   It's gonna be never all things we like,
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.760]   'cause it's a process, but am I happy with it?
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.960]   Am I not happy with it?
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.360]   Are there weeds that are coming up all over the place?
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:46.220]   That could be the intrusive thoughts, right?
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.860]   So we're using metaphors,
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:50.720]   but it's actually very, very concrete, right?
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.080]   The salience part is what is going on inside of me,
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:58.860]   and that's a very interesting inquiry and informative, right?
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:01.240]   It's interesting because it's informative.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.700]   - Do you think that's an inquiry that's best done
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.320]   in meditative-like states, or setting aside
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:12.540]   some deliberate time to think about,
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.180]   like, what am I thinking about?
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.560]   What am I paying attention to?
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:18.920]   How am I allocating my thoughts?
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.360]   Or are my thoughts being allocated?
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.100]   I guess we have to respect the unconscious component here.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.640]   Like we're not, we don't just walk around and say,
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.640]   I'm gonna place my attentional spotlight there,
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:30.000]   and then my thinking here, you know.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.640]   - We always wanna be aware of what we,
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:32.980]   there are things we don't know.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.600]   That's respectful, that's appropriate humility,
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.160]   because it's true.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.440]   - So I'm assuming this ratchets directly
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.340]   into the cupboard of behavior.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:45.200]   You know, what we're actually doing.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:51.020]   Is that covered best explored by listing off,
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:55.100]   perhaps on paper, in our minds, what we're doing each day?
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.540]   Is that one way to explore?
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.240]   Like, how am I spending my time?
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.740]   Again, not as an efficiency exercise,
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:06.740]   but as a way to start to explore the self and the mind,
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:11.460]   for sake of building up to more agency and gratitude.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.540]   - Right, right.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:16.940]   You know, the routes to most effective self inquiry, right?
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:19.200]   To bringing the conscious mind to bear
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.540]   really differ widely by person.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.740]   There's some people who they're so well-served
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:25.980]   by doing that when they're meditating, right?
[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:27.060]   There are other people who like,
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:30.060]   they can really get at that when they're playing a sport.
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.540]   You know, it's going on inside of them,
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:34.400]   along with the other things that they're doing.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.940]   Some people find it in the shower,
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.540]   or they find it when they wake up in the morning,
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:40.860]   or they find it when they're with an animal they love,
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:42.500]   or they might find it when they're reading
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.440]   a certain kind of material, and then they read it,
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.300]   and then the reading trails off, and they're thinking.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:49.180]   They're a reverie sort of inside.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:53.540]   So how we can engender the best use of our conscious minds
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.960]   is gonna differ by person.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.220]   But again, we can think about that.
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.380]   Like, what really works for me?
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:58.260]   Let me do more of that.
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:01.160]   Someone, and it's interesting, we see people sometimes,
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.300]   I see people a lot of the time who are,
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.980]   they're trying to meditate to understand themselves,
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:07.320]   and it's like not working, right?
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.340]   And it's like, I must know how to meditate
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.440]   in order to understand myself.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.640]   Well, it's not necessarily true.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.820]   It might be, I must go on more hikes
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.180]   in order to better understand myself,
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:18.080]   because that's how it works for me.
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.220]   So that process of reflection can be very, very helpful
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:24.040]   to us, because we're using our conscious mind
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.880]   to try and either look inward, what is sailing it to me,
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.780]   including understanding that I don't understand everything,
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:32.460]   but I can understand a lot of it,
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:35.700]   and outward, what behaviors am I engaging in?
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.820]   What are my behavior patterns?
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:41.740]   And to be reflective about that, to think about that,
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:44.460]   can be immensely helpful to us.
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:48.240]   Like, how am I spending those hours of the day?
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.420]   What am I doing with my time?
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.880]   Am I wasting my time?
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:55.960]   Do I always get mad and say something mean to somebody?
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:56.800]   Why?
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.620]   Because I had a negative thought about something?
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:00.220]   Am I doing that?
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.020]   No, have I kind of changed
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:04.500]   since something unpleasant happened,
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:08.940]   and now I'm not so nice to someone in the household?
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.980]   Or am I taking a lot better care of myself?
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:14.820]   Like, since I started doing X, whatever X may be,
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:19.100]   learning more about myself, doing more of the things I like,
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:22.580]   left that old job, it was so hard for me to leave.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:25.040]   I do actually get myself to the gym.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.940]   So it's a reflection upon self,
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:31.060]   because a lot of what we do, we do automatically.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:32.840]   And that's very important.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:36.260]   The example that often is given is,
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:39.600]   okay, think about how you last brushed your teeth, right?
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.540]   And the answer by like, a blank, right?
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:43.800]   Because you brushed your teeth in an automatic way, right?
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.860]   Most of us don't remember that
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:48.260]   because we just skip right over it.
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:49.400]   So it makes sense.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.540]   It lets us think while we're doing things.
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.180]   It lets a lot happen automatically in the physical world,
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:58.300]   right, just as it happens inside of us automatically.
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:01.420]   But we can have sort of too much of a good thing
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:03.900]   where too much is happening automatically,
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:07.080]   and we wanna stop and think.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.540]   And it's remarkable how sometimes when people stop and think,
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:11.840]   they might say, like, a real example is,
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:15.940]   I don't wanna be spending five nights a week at the bar,
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:18.100]   and I'm spending five nights a week at the bar, why?
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:21.740]   Because I go home a certain way from work,
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.620]   and there's a bar along that way,
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:25.440]   and then I think, oh, I'll just stop in
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.520]   and maybe see a friend.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.620]   And then I know that once I get in there,
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:30.520]   I'm gonna have a drink, and I know once I have a drink,
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:33.440]   I'm gonna get three, and I'm gonna have three,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.220]   and I see this pattern of behaviors
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:38.900]   and how, like, I don't decide.
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:40.940]   I'm gonna go to that bar instead of going home
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:42.900]   to see my wife or my husband or my kids
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.460]   or whatever it may be,
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.420]   and I don't wanna behave that way, right?
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:49.300]   Because there, it's a great example
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.880]   of how you can stop that from happening,
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.680]   but once it starts happening, the dominoes start falling.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.000]   It's very, very hard.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.620]   The people don't generally realize,
[01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:00.300]   oh my goodness, I'm in the bar and I've had one drink,
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.540]   now I'm gonna have two more.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:04.340]   That's not the time, but the understanding,
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:06.600]   the reflection upon behavior patterns
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.560]   can lead a person to stop those behaviors,
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.600]   to understand and recognize them,
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:14.540]   get their arms around them, shine the light of day on them,
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.700]   and then have greater agency, right?
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.620]   Greater gratitude.
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:20.500]   I'm grateful I can go home to my family,
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.200]   and that's what I choose to do, right?
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.120]   And I can do that.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.620]   I do not have to end up at that bar,
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:26.300]   and I'm not gonna end up at that bar.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:28.180]   I'm gonna drive a different way home,
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:29.840]   and if I can't get myself to do that,
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:31.800]   I'm gonna have a friend in the car with me,
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.580]   and if I can't do that, I'll be in the back seat, right?
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:38.420]   But I'm not doing that thing I choose not to do.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:42.700]   And that's a more dramatic example, not an uncommon one,
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:45.620]   but we can apply that the whole way up the list
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.420]   from nuances of our behaviors
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:50.540]   down to more dramatic behaviors.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:54.260]   - I've heard you describe the unconscious mind
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:58.840]   and some of its other interconnected workings
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.820]   with the analogy of a phantom in the driver's seat
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.460]   and we're in the back seat.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:07.900]   Sort of, you know, of course, all within one person, right?
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:10.340]   This idea that we're just being taken places
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.900]   that we don't want to go or that we know we shouldn't go
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.900]   or that we can't really figure out why we're going there.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.060]   And we have some idea,
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:21.500]   but we're just not certain about what's going on.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:24.820]   You know, it's not necessarily related
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:27.580]   to really destructive action either.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:30.560]   I mean, it can be, but what you're describing
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.100]   sounds to me a lot like climbing out of the back seat
[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:36.340]   and maybe sitting in the passenger seat
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.020]   and looking into the driver's seat and like,
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:41.820]   oh, like there's something else going on here.
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:43.640]   Of course, all of this is one mind.
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:50.020]   And in doing that, taking some control of the vehicle.
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:54.260]   - Right, it's about understanding what is that phantom?
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.740]   Where did it come from?
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.580]   That's how we get rid of it.
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.380]   It's like, how do we get back in the driver's seat?
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:00.420]   We don't grab the phantom and throw it out the door
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.900]   or throw it in the back seat, right?
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.500]   It's ephemeral, we can't grab it, right?
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.060]   So how does it go away?
[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:08.860]   It goes away through understanding.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.800]   So very common example that the phantom
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.980]   in the driver's seat is trauma,
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.420]   that we have pushed in an unconscious place
[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:20.400]   and now that hole under the surface structure
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:23.800]   of the iceberg is fragmented and it's sort of roiling
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:25.860]   and there's a big problem there.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:28.060]   And if we go at that problem
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.900]   and whatever it's spinning off, right?
[01:59:29.900 --> 01:59:32.180]   That's the abscess, but it's a bad one
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.180]   and it's spinning off a lot of problems.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.180]   And that's why the phantom is in the driver's seat
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:38.340]   because healthy things are not built
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:42.420]   on top of that fracturing and roiling part of the iceberg.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:44.380]   We see that a lot.
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:46.580]   The phantom could also be something different.
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:50.220]   It could be one defense mechanism that's unhealthy
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.020]   that we are really over relying on
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:55.320]   and then we can understand it through that lens.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.140]   So there are just a few examples,
[01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:00.220]   but if we sort of wake up in the backseat of the car,
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:03.360]   so to speak, and the phantom is driving recklessly,
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:05.800]   then how we get the phantom out of the front seat
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.900]   is by understanding it.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:09.400]   Then I always imagine proof it goes away
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:12.220]   because now it's not driving my life anymore, right?
[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:13.860]   I'm driving my life, it's gone.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.420]   - The message that I'm hearing over and over again
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:20.900]   in my head is that no matter how well
[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:25.140]   or how poorly any of our lives happen to be going,
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:28.420]   that by looking in these cupboards
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:31.040]   under structure of self and function of self,
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:34.500]   we can have so much more positive control.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.660]   - Yes, yes.
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.940]   That's why ultimately what we're talking about is optimistic.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:43.840]   We can't help ourselves if we don't honor truth, right?
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.240]   And the truth is that there are complex aspects of this.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.040]   So, okay, we wanna go look at that
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:50.740]   and we wanna look at how things can go wrong
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.820]   and that's all very, very important,
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:56.060]   but that's all wrapped in the best truth,
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:58.420]   which is that we can change it.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.800]   We can make it better.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.340]   That's why the self, the garden of self,
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:05.780]   is on top of the structure of self, right?
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:09.660]   And the top of the function of self are our strivings.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:12.860]   That's what comes next after behaviors.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:14.540]   It's like, what are my behaviors doing?
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:15.380]   What am I doing?
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.940]   What am I striving towards?
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:19.580]   What am I doing, literally?
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:22.380]   Am I going to a job I hate?
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:24.340]   Am I doing things I don't wanna do?
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:27.420]   Am I accepting treatment that I don't wanna accept?
[02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:31.140]   Am I treating people in ways I don't wanna accept?
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:33.260]   How can I strive for better?
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:36.540]   And striving and hopefulness are so intertwined.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:41.020]   So the pinnacle of the function pillar is striving.
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:45.580]   The pinnacle of the structure pillar is self.
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:49.180]   And we can see how the self, the strivings, right,
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:52.380]   what we're doing now is combining the pillars,
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.500]   where it comes together and your imagery of it.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.500]   That's where the geyser comes from.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.300]   And we want that geyser to be healthy, right?
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:04.820]   It's a stream of clear, clean water that's coming out of it.
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:07.100]   That's where our empowerment is.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.580]   But empowerment is a condition of being, right?
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:10.620]   I am empowered.
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:12.740]   Empowerment rests within me.
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.700]   That's where humility comes into the picture.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:18.660]   Humility also, something within me, right?
[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:21.340]   I have humility, they're not verbs.
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:26.340]   But empowerment and humility then gain their expression.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:30.460]   At the top of that geyser, when agency and gratitude,
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.780]   those verbs arise from empowerment and humility.
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:35.740]   - What you've drawn for us
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.900]   is an incredibly compelling picture.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:43.900]   Because the picture, the map, is really a roadmap.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:47.220]   It's a path to ideals.
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:51.220]   And you've been talking about these ideals
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.440]   of agency and gratitude across this series.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.920]   And they just encompass so much.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.760]   And as you mentioned before,
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:01.860]   they are interconnected and they are verb states.
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:04.900]   And a critical component of the geysering up
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.300]   from the pillars toward agency and gratitude
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.220]   are these two components of empowerment and humility.
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:15.320]   Tell us a little bit more about empowerment and humility
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.620]   and how we should view empowerment and humility
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.580]   in the context of self-care.
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:27.000]   - Empowerment is a state that we can create for ourselves
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.120]   if we're taking care of the pillars, right?
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.440]   So we're looking in the cupboards.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:34.980]   We're doing the things that make our map clearer and clearer.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:37.020]   This idea that, oh, that seemed like a good path,
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:39.800]   but it gets clearer and there's a swamp there, right?
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.460]   Or that didn't seem like a good path
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.980]   because it's circuitous.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:44.980]   Oh no, but there are good things along that path.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:48.880]   So the map gets clearer as we tend to the cupboards
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.440]   in the pillars and that empowers us, right?
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:55.140]   We're in a state, there's a state inside of us
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:56.540]   that is a state of potentials
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:59.000]   that are now skewed in a good way, right?
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.240]   That's what empowerment is.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.660]   It's like, it's not something that happens.
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:06.060]   It's a state that we then bring to bear on what happens,
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:06.900]   right?
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.260]   The same is true of humility.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:13.320]   You know, humility does not mean not acknowledging things
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.020]   that are good about you, right?
[02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:19.580]   And we often can very much mischaracterize humility.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.000]   Like, is that person being weak?
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.220]   Is it false humility?
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.280]   Or people often who are conscientious
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.000]   don't wanna acknowledge good things about them.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.220]   Oh no, no, I'm not that smart.
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:29.080]   Like, that's not humility, right?
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:33.660]   Humility is consistent with truth, right?
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:35.840]   So if you keep saying you're not that smart,
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.480]   but the world around you tells you that you're that smart,
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.460]   right, then acknowledge that you're that smart, right?
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.980]   That's coming through the lens of truth, right?
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:47.960]   And we can go down to the pillars and the cupboards
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.060]   and say, okay, how does a person get
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:51.400]   to acknowledging that truth, right?
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:55.400]   So it's only by squaring away the things
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.860]   that humility isn't, right?
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:58.960]   It is not denigrating ourselves.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:01.100]   And we see that in a lot of people.
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:04.280]   I'm humble, so, and then that person often tells you
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.820]   why they're accepting something that's not good to accept.
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:11.760]   So humility is about acknowledging truthfully
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.920]   the characteristics that you have
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.860]   within yourself, good and bad.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:18.020]   And here is where we can identify things
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.120]   that we're not so happy with, right?
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:21.800]   We have to have humility within us
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:23.800]   in order to make ourselves better, right?
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:26.640]   Just like I have to say, look, I'd like to be more fit
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.920]   if I'm gonna then get myself in a more fit state, right?
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:32.880]   So saying, look, I can be, you know,
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:35.200]   I can be a little bit so snippy with people
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.920]   if I'm irritated, or I can be a little bit condescending,
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:42.520]   or, you know, I can be a little selfish at times, right?
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.620]   It's hard to admit these things to ourselves,
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:48.880]   but if we have the humility to acknowledge those things,
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:52.200]   right, then we also get to have that broader humility
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.640]   about just being a person.
[02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:57.320]   Like, wow, look how complicated this is to navigate life.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:58.820]   I mean, these pillars are not simple.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:02.040]   And when we go down to the real base elements of them,
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.760]   it can get very complicated.
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:08.440]   So then we have a compassion, right, for self and for others.
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.480]   You know, like sometimes I'll say to a person,
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.800]   oh, I should be doing this, I should be doing that.
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:13.760]   They think they should be doing something perfectly.
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:15.120]   And I will say to them,
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:18.380]   it's amazing that we're moving forward, right?
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:22.160]   I mean, let's start with, wow, it's not easy to be human.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.280]   It's not easy to navigate this world.
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:27.480]   And that kind of humility can then allow us
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:30.280]   to feel good about what we build on top of it, right?
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:32.440]   It's not easy to navigate this world.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.240]   And humans are pretty vulnerable by and large,
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.840]   but I'm applying myself, right?
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.360]   And I'm proud that I'm applying myself
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.400]   or that I'm perseverant,
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.120]   but also I'd like to be a little more compassionate.
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:45.940]   Like, it's that sort of thing
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:48.180]   that combines with empowerment.
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:52.540]   So empowerment and humility are these potential states
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.920]   that then express themselves or become enacted,
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:57.120]   however we wish to put that,
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.600]   but they change into the active verbs
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.580]   of agency and gratitude.
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:07.380]   And agency and gratitude are ways of being, right?
[02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:09.340]   They're verbs, they're active.
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.560]   So that's the point of it
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.200]   from the sense of how we are living, right?
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:15.820]   How we are being.
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:18.400]   That's why agency and gratitude is,
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:21.320]   in some sense, its own endpoint, right?
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:25.120]   But because there's a circular aspect of this, right?
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.200]   Our active being is not the endpoint.
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:30.920]   If we're being in a healthy way,
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:33.860]   then we get to experience things, right?
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:36.400]   Peace, contentment, delight.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:39.660]   We experience them because we are healthy.
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:44.360]   So we get to be through the lens of agency and gratitude.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:49.160]   We get to experience peace, contentment, and delight,
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:51.880]   and that makes a healthier us.
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:55.240]   The drives and their expression are in better balance.
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:58.400]   The generative drive is fostered and strengthened,
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.240]   and the drives underneath of it,
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.860]   the aggression, assertion, proactive, right?
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:05.780]   We're really using that in a good way,
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.720]   and we're mining all of it within us.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:09.000]   Like, I wanna bring that to bear,
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.040]   and I can bring more of it to bear, right?
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.640]   That's very, very good.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:15.480]   And the pleasure drive is active in us.
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:16.840]   I'm enjoying the things I do.
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.280]   I feel good about the things I do.
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:19.800]   I'm making good choices.
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:21.920]   And that state of health,
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:25.320]   it promotes the pillars, the cupboards,
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:28.880]   to stay clean and clear and healthy, right?
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:30.920]   But life is life,
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.080]   and the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.200]   the slings and arrows of life will continue to come at us
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.720]   and cause us to go back
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.640]   and look at the pillars and the cupboards.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.760]   And even if they don't come at us,
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.940]   those things are never perfect, right?
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.800]   But that's not bad because by tending to them,
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:49.760]   where do we bring ourselves?
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.480]   We bring ourselves back to the active verbs
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.720]   of agency and gratitude,
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:56.720]   the active verbs of living.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:58.940]   And here we are in this cycle
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:01.000]   that if we pay attention to it,
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.680]   we use it to understand ourselves,
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.580]   we use it to improve ourselves,
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:07.720]   can bring us to better lives.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.680]   - How do you think about a person,
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:14.000]   and I confess I've been this person,
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.200]   perhaps still am to some extent,
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.200]   who can really have a sense of agency and gratitude
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:25.900]   in certain domains, maybe even many domains of life,
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:31.220]   and yet feels as if there are certain areas of life
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.280]   that are just so much more challenging than others
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.200]   by this like stark contrast,
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.120]   like this stuff works, can do that,
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:40.840]   but like this stuff is just really, really hard.
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.680]   And maybe that continues long enough
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:45.880]   that it almost starts to feel like,
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:48.360]   or the person wonders whether or not,
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:52.040]   maybe that part of life is inaccessible to me,
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:54.340]   it's just never going to be successful for me.
[02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:58.760]   How do you think about these carve-outs
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:02.520]   of functionality and lack of functionality?
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:03.800]   That's probably not the right language,
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:06.920]   but I think this is important
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:10.160]   because it relates directly, I believe,
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.520]   to the kind of narratives that we tell ourselves.
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.600]   I mean, they are narratives, right?
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:15.960]   I think it's important to think about these
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.140]   because they are intermeshed with,
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:23.460]   and perhaps even the consequence of narratives that we have,
[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:26.160]   like stories about ourselves that we have internally.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:30.800]   And again, I'll be the first to admit
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:34.360]   that I've felt this way for much of my life.
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.720]   Certain things I can do, other things are far harder,
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.520]   and sometimes it felt outside the reach of possibility.
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:44.600]   I have a very concise answer to this one.
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.580]   In fact, it's nine words.
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:50.800]   Don't make yourself special in ways that hurt you.
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:53.980]   And we tend to do that as humans.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:57.780]   Oh, I get to have A, B, and C, but I don't get to have D.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:59.260]   I get to have professional success,
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:01.140]   and I'm in pretty good shape, and I have a lot of friends,
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:03.380]   but I don't get to have a relationship.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:05.940]   I mean, over and over and over.
[02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:08.900]   Because the relationship part is so emotionally laden,
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:11.260]   it's the part that gets carved out, right?
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:14.340]   Falsely carved out the most, right?
[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:17.020]   But it can happen in any arena of life
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:18.820]   where we make ourselves special
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:20.940]   in a way that really is black magic
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:22.540]   or is being cursed, right?
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:24.420]   You have the machinery, right?
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:28.600]   The ability, the function to go about
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:31.620]   pursuing the things you want and get them, right?
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:34.100]   That sounds like a pretty good paradigm.
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:38.140]   Accept about something really important to you, right?
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:40.300]   That can't be, right?
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:42.940]   We're applying the same machinery of self
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:45.660]   because we're talking about things people want
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:46.700]   on a broad scale, right?
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:48.220]   Like, I would like professional success.
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:49.520]   I would like personal success.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:52.420]   I would like to do well in my family unit
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:53.780]   and be a good family member.
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:55.060]   I would like romance, right?
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.780]   So we're talking about areas of self, right?
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:01.340]   And we will make ourselves special by carving out one
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:04.900]   and then applying black magic or some cursed state
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:07.380]   that then takes that away from us,
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:09.780]   and that creates tremendous consternation.
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.480]   That will throw all of those cupboards
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:14.860]   in those pyramids off balance
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.820]   because we don't like that.
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.700]   Like, that seems mysterious and ominous.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:21.660]   You know, what is there that you don't know
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:24.460]   that's about being cursed so you can't have something?
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:27.460]   And then that makes anger and frustration in us
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:30.540]   and more likely that we'll act out or we'll be frustrated
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:33.180]   and we start enjoying things less, right?
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:36.020]   Sometimes a person can wall something off like that
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:37.900]   and they can go forward with the rest of life.
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:40.180]   I mean, it affects them, but it's not obvious.
[02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:42.020]   It's not on their mind all the time,
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:44.140]   which is why the process of self inquiry
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:46.180]   can reveal important things.
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:49.460]   Like, oh, like I pretend that I don't even care
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.420]   about professional success and it's the only,
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:52.260]   why do I do that?
[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:54.420]   It's the only thing I'm not doing very well
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:58.020]   and because I think it's impossible for me.
[02:12:58.020 --> 02:12:59.620]   It's not something I get.
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:00.460]   Why?
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:02.740]   Because I got other things so I don't get that.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:06.180]   Okay, now we're really curious about that.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.860]   And sometimes it causes very, very big problems
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:13.720]   where a person can build an external sense of self
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:16.340]   that sues some of their vulnerability
[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:18.660]   so they can present in a certain way.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.820]   But underneath of that, they're hiding the sadness
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:24.340]   or the pain of what is missing,
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:27.940]   but that is then sort of eating away at them
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.220]   and their feelings of self on the inside
[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:32.820]   don't match what people see on the outside.
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:36.420]   We see a lot of this and the process of self inquiry,
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:39.180]   of self exploration, of curiosity about self
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:42.220]   can lead us to realize what we've carved out
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:45.740]   if we don't already realize it or it can help us to see
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:48.900]   that the carve out makes no sense, right?
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:50.900]   It's as if you said, well, you know,
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:53.060]   there are nine roads around my home
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.900]   and they're all just regular old roads.
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.260]   I can drive on eight of them, but not the ninth.
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.620]   And you say, well, it doesn't make any sense
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:04.660]   if they're similar, it requires the same set of skills,
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.860]   right, if they know how to drive the car
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:07.220]   and the visual acuity,
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.620]   why wouldn't you be able to drive down the ninth?
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:13.500]   But even though that's a very mundane example,
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:17.580]   but it's that, that we apply to very important
[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:20.660]   and emotionally charged aspects of our life.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:23.840]   You know, I get to have physical fitness and friends
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:26.980]   and career success, but I don't get to have love.
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.860]   I mean, we hear people say this
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:33.860]   and that's a very powerful way of taking us away
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:36.300]   from what we want to achieve in life.
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:40.020]   It takes us away from the active agency and gratitude
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:42.240]   and all the good that comes of that.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.500]   - What you just said makes a lot of sense,
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:46.660]   especially the point that, you know,
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:49.140]   if we have nine roads around us
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.940]   and we can drive down eight of them, why not the ninth?
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:56.920]   Because it places us back into the verb tense
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:59.800]   and the action tense of like the car, like we're a vehicle,
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:02.180]   the I that we can take through the world, right?
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:03.440]   Sure, conditions matter.
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:06.240]   Maybe road number nine has boulders on it,
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.480]   but you know, it can't be that roads one through eight
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:13.420]   were all just smooth super highways either, right?
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:18.260]   Those had challenges and we, I'm not going to use myself
[02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:22.100]   as a example, I, for whoever's doing this sort of exercise,
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:25.560]   had a mind that was able to work around those boulders,
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:28.180]   right, of challenging people, of, you know,
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:32.060]   limited finances of these are all things I've experienced,
[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:33.860]   you know, and of course people come into the world
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:36.020]   with different levels of challenge and privilege
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:37.380]   and accessibility, et cetera.
[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:38.660]   We don't want to deny all of that,
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:43.660]   but those other eight roads are rarely, if ever,
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:45.700]   perfectly smooth roads.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:48.460]   - That's why it's completely about the self, right?
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:53.460]   And it's the realization that if I brought myself to bear
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:56.840]   and I got down the first eight,
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:59.760]   I can bring myself to bear and get down the ninth.
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:00.640]   And as you're pointing out,
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:03.040]   it's not like the first eight were easy, right?
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.840]   Maybe one of them was really pretty smooth, right?
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:07.720]   But there's going to be a couple of them in there
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:11.860]   that have raised really strong difficulties,
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:13.800]   things to surmount and to overcome.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.040]   And it's from that place of understanding
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.340]   that we find within ourselves the courage, the strength
[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:22.000]   to go down the ninth road.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.860]   Even if we see greater barriers,
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:26.080]   even if we're, okay, I'm aware now,
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.580]   but I'm also aware that I avoided that ninth road
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:29.880]   for a reason, right?
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:32.160]   The boulders and the potholes, right?
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.700]   They're more severe on that road.
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:38.120]   In fact, I'm kind of worried that it's impassable,
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.960]   but I mean, it can't be impassable, right?
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:42.400]   If there's boulders there, I'll, you know,
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.660]   I'll go rent some excavating equipment
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.280]   or I'll fill in the potholes, right?
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.320]   And that's how we get ourselves to go forward
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.920]   and to acknowledge and validate.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:51.240]   Like, I'm afraid of doing that.
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.400]   If I weren't afraid of doing it,
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.200]   I would have done it already, right?
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:57.080]   But I now realize what the truth is
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.560]   and what I brought to bear in the first eight.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:02.040]   And I'm gonna bring myself to bear for the ninth.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.240]   That's also when we recruit often resources around us.
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:06.920]   We might say, let me tell a couple of good friends
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.560]   about this or a clergy member or a therapist
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:11.120]   or, you know, a trusted other.
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.940]   And let me explore this more in myself.
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:17.800]   And that's often how in making ourselves better,
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:20.640]   we engage more with the people around us
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:22.440]   and then the support from someone else
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.560]   that may help a person do that, right?
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:26.840]   Is support given back to the other person?
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:30.320]   And this is also how we build the beyond self
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:33.600]   is that the path to travel down the ninth road,
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.360]   so to speak, we don't have to travel alone,
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:37.840]   you know, much of the time,
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.320]   but that often almost always wasn't in the person's mind,
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:43.160]   right?
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:46.940]   They perceive, it's a three person job, you know,
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:49.280]   to go down and say, great, you have two friends.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.720]   Yes, certainly where I've been able
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:54.900]   to travel down certain roads,
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:59.580]   the key features have been a desire to go down that road,
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:02.720]   a recognition of the landscape,
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:05.800]   but not trying to take on the whole thing all at once
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:08.240]   and then finding really good people
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.960]   and frankly, really trying to avoid people
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:15.560]   that seemed, you know, poisonous to the journey, right?
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:16.800]   That we're going to, you know,
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:20.240]   throw toxic things into the engine of my vehicle.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.760]   And that's putting a lot on them,
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.240]   but, you know, it just felt as if going down
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.400]   those other roads was too valuable an expedition
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.480]   to spend time on and with people
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:37.600]   that it wasn't helpful to spend time with.
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.580]   And at the same time, there have always been good people
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:45.560]   that have presented themselves with examples.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:47.520]   I think, you know, this is where it comes to mind,
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:49.960]   you know, it's not always the case that, you know,
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:51.720]   you got a friend who's saying you can do this
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.960]   and here's why, or a therapist that says you can do this
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.120]   and here's why, but that there are examples in the world
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.920]   of like, well, this person did this.
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:03.520]   I think when we have challenges in a certain domain,
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.520]   you know, that ninth road, so to speak,
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.900]   I know for myself that I know I'm in a place of futility
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:15.380]   when I start to reflexively orient towards others
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:18.280]   that have had a problem getting down that road.
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.220]   You know, like, oh, like I recognize this other person
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:23.880]   who's been good at roads one through eight, but not nine.
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:26.920]   And it occurred to me during the course of this series,
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:31.920]   really that, you know, why not pick different examples?
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.340]   - So if you're going on a journey, right,
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.460]   and it's a really important journey
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:40.120]   and it's a difficult journey, but it can be awesome.
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:43.680]   Bring good people, right?
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.420]   Have them on your journey, be on their journey.
[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:48.900]   And then you think, well,
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:51.300]   why would a person not bring good people?
[02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:53.620]   If I were going on a journey and it's gonna be arduous,
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:56.460]   but wow, we could see amazing things along the way,
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:59.020]   I can bring a couple of people with me.
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:01.540]   I don't wanna choose a couple of people who are lazy,
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:03.280]   you know, some who, you know,
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:04.940]   don't look at the world around them
[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:07.660]   and, you know, some that won't be helpful
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:08.700]   to somebody else's needs.
[02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:12.580]   Like, why would one choose that, right?
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:15.480]   It comes back to the self, right?
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:17.480]   If a person, now we're talking about any journey, right,
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.440]   'cause it's the journey of life, right?
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.260]   If a person is choosing people,
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:23.340]   you wouldn't choose to be on the journey with you.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:26.440]   It's because you don't think that you're worth better, right?
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:28.460]   And if you think that you're worth better,
[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:30.380]   you won't choose the people.
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:32.460]   You'll say, I want other people like me.
[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:36.800]   I'm gonna be diligent, perceptive, collegial, cooperative.
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:40.040]   So I'm gonna surround myself with people like that.
[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:42.800]   And if we look beyond ourselves at groups of people
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:45.380]   and at culture, the healthier we are,
[02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:47.420]   the more we ally with healthy people
[02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:49.580]   and the more healthy we are
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:51.580]   because we're making ourselves healthy.
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:53.540]   We get healthier groups of people.
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:55.560]   The journey is better for all of us.
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.940]   And this is how we can make the whole culture better, right?
[02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:00.660]   Potentially, this is how we can make life
[02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:03.620]   on the planet better, but it has to start somewhere.
[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:06.640]   So it has to start with the I.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:11.700]   I love, love, love the message
[02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:14.100]   that if you're heading off on a journey,
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:17.100]   that's really meaningful to go with
[02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:20.920]   and make sure that you interact with good people.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:25.920]   This is actually a place where a reference to social media
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:30.600]   and online communities is actually worthwhile
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:32.700]   and can be very beneficial.
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:35.600]   I think it's easy for us to kind of roll our eyes
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:38.120]   at self-help and things like that.
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:42.100]   On the other hand, there are communities online
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:43.740]   that I consider myself a part of,
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:46.500]   but for which I and many other people
[02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:48.840]   derived a lot of strength,
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:53.480]   a lot of reassurance and confidence, right?
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:56.120]   Because a lot of people are isolated.
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:57.960]   They might have access to one or two people
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:21:59.360]   in their community that they really value,
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:01.760]   but those people are perhaps also busy with other people.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:04.180]   Or I can remember being a student alone
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:08.140]   in my studio apartment as an undergraduate.
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:11.160]   I'm feeling very much against the grain
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.180]   of my local environment, you know,
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:15.380]   too much partying for me at the time,
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:16.740]   meaning I wasn't partying
[02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:18.100]   and there was a lot of partying around me.
[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:20.180]   And had I been a better student in high school,
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:23.240]   I probably would have been able to healthily engage in that,
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:24.080]   but I just wasn't able.
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:26.900]   So feeling pretty isolated, but knowing I was on a path.
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:30.420]   So in that case, it was one professor,
[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:32.420]   one graduate student,
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:35.180]   and a hell of a lot of books and music
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:37.560]   that to me just carried me through.
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:38.400]   You know, nowadays,
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:41.300]   I'm fortunate to have many more direct resources
[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:43.460]   in my life of amazing people.
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:45.260]   But I just want to mention that
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:47.940]   because I think in this discussion around self-care
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:49.700]   and the various practices,
[02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:52.940]   I think there are sure to be people who are, you know,
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:55.480]   that kid, that woman, that man that's, you know,
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:58.280]   like alone in a room thinking like, okay, but how, right?
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:00.780]   I see the grocer once a week
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.580]   and I see my neighbor and they don't even say hello,
[02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:06.900]   you know, and you know how to start to access
[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:09.180]   some of these better connections.
[02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:12.020]   - Right, navigating the online world
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:13.940]   is navigating the world, right?
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:16.980]   It comes down to understanding and choice.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:18.940]   So if we're understanding as best we can,
[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:21.000]   we're making choice as best we can,
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.340]   then we'll find great things online.
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:25.380]   There are great things to find online.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:26.880]   Same is true of life.
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:29.580]   If we're searching for something that, for example,
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:32.780]   allies us around hatred, around acting out,
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:34.180]   around things that make us unhappy,
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:35.880]   even around commiseration,
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:39.220]   instead of thinking about how we can make things better,
[02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:41.960]   right, then we bring ourselves in a different direction.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:43.160]   That's life.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:46.460]   If we understand and we choose as best we can,
[02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:50.240]   we will lead ourself to better places.
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:52.540]   - Such an important message.
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:54.580]   And as a perfect segue into a question that I,
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:59.580]   and I'm certain many, many other people have about anger.
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:02.860]   And, you know, not just anger from interpersonal conflict,
[02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:05.640]   like somebody said something and it really upset me,
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:08.640]   but stuff that we see, stuff that we observe in the world.
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:11.940]   It could be acts against other people,
[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:14.140]   words against other people, or, you know,
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:15.460]   that we take reference to.
[02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:20.220]   And I think many people feel yanked around by,
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:23.380]   you know, even dragged by something they see
[02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.660]   and they can't get it out of their head.
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.060]   Now, there could be all sorts of reasons
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:29.820]   related to each and all of us,
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.260]   why we can't get it out of our head,
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.600]   work that we need to do, et cetera.
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.300]   But according to the map of mental health
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.800]   that you've laid out for us,
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:41.860]   things that get in the way of that generative drive
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.860]   are really quite poisonous to our wellbeing
[02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:46.220]   and the wellbeing of the world,
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:49.580]   because that generative drive is about learning, creation,
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:54.320]   and tends to be pro-social in so many ways.
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:57.040]   Tell us about anger and how, from a frame of reference
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:59.700]   of trying to engage in self-care,
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:02.900]   we should think about our anger and work with our anger
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:06.680]   in ways that can perhaps even help us and not harm us.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:09.700]   - In order to really understand this,
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.940]   and I think this is so important,
[02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:14.460]   we have to define three words, right?
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:17.060]   And the word to start with is affect.
[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:20.300]   So affect is aroused in us, right?
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:23.880]   Meaning we don't have control over it.
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.260]   So anger is an affect.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:27.820]   It is aroused in us.
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:31.300]   The idea being that if a person is walking down the street
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:34.180]   and someone jumps in front of them and shoves them,
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:35.580]   anger is aroused in them.
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:37.560]   They don't choose to be angry.
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:39.680]   In fact, the body reacts
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:41.420]   and has all sorts of fight or flight responses
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:44.600]   before the person even realizes that they're angry.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.400]   So we can't control what is aroused in us
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:49.600]   in the immediate term.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:51.640]   We can in the longer term.
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:54.960]   If I have a short fuse and I get angry really easily,
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:56.240]   you know, I can't really control that
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.040]   in the next 10 minutes, right?
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.640]   Meaning the affect that's aroused in me,
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.000]   I can do different things with it,
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.400]   but I can't change what's created in me.
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:04.960]   But if I'm living a better life,
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.640]   taking better care of myself,
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:08.680]   the generative drive is better expressed,
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.440]   I have more pleasure in my life,
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.280]   then what happens is the mechanisms that arouse
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:16.160]   so much anger start to arouse less anger.
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.800]   So by taking care of ourselves, we arouse less anger,
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.240]   but anger is aroused in us, okay?
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:27.200]   The next word is feeling, right?
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:29.680]   And there are different definitions for these words,
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:33.920]   but the way we're defining them, affect is aroused,
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.460]   feeling is when we take that affect
[02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:39.400]   and we relate it to the self.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:42.200]   It's the next thing that happens on the way up
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.360]   'cause the arousal of affect is very deep in the brain.
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.640]   As it comes up, the next thing it does
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.120]   is relate that affect to self.
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:52.600]   So this is where the classic example
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:55.580]   of a person who spills something,
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:58.240]   they are angry that thing is spilled,
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.560]   it raises anger in them.
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:02.240]   Then they become aware and they match the anger to self
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:04.160]   and say, what a dummy, right?
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:06.320]   What a jerk, I'll never do anything right.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.400]   They say it inside, right?
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.320]   Because the anger gets enacted against the self.
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.860]   Now, how would we like that to go?
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:15.960]   Where the person's taking better care of themselves
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:20.100]   so when they spill something, less anger is aroused.
[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:22.280]   And by the time it gets to consciousness,
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:24.440]   there's less anger so it's easier to manage
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.560]   and there's a stronger sense of self,
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:28.560]   all the other aspects of the pillars
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:30.820]   and the cupboards are in a good place,
[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:32.620]   then the person is better able to manage
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:35.360]   what anger makes it, right, to feeling.
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.440]   And then to say, you know, okay,
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.120]   everybody spills something now and then, whatever,
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.240]   and then to clean it up and the person doesn't have to
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:44.160]   enact the anger towards themselves, right?
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:47.360]   So affect, feeling, and then emotion.
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:51.820]   So emotion is when we relate the affect and the feeling
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:54.460]   to others in the world around us.
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:58.620]   So for example, a person might spill something
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:01.520]   and then it arouses anger and now they get
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:03.560]   to the feeling part but they have a set
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.680]   of unhealthy defenses and they don't think
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:08.400]   they're responsible for things they're responsible for
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:11.800]   so they just keep that load of anger, right,
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:16.040]   that affect upwards until they get to emotion
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.140]   and then they decide, that wasn't my fault, it was yours.
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:21.280]   And that's why maybe they kick the dog
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:24.020]   or they slap somebody or they say something mean
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:26.080]   like this happens.
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:29.340]   So if it happens a lot, like this is part and parcel
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:32.680]   of what's going on in us a lot about negative emotions.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:34.960]   Maybe there can be dramatic examples
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:37.960]   but there's smaller examples that are winding their way
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:41.840]   through our lives and the better we take care of ourselves,
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:45.380]   the less aroused negative affect we have
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:47.740]   and the better we cope with it when it gets
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:50.400]   to the level of the I and when it gets
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.880]   to the level of the you, right?
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.720]   And if we think about pro-social, collaborative behaviors
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:29:00.480]   versus the inaction of anger on a large scale, right,
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:03.640]   if by the time it gets to you, there's still a lot
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.140]   of anger there, it is very easy to then paint
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:07.720]   with a broad brush, right?
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:09.960]   Oh, the problems are that demographic, right?
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:12.640]   The problems are those people who aren't like me, right?
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:17.160]   That's where anger is at its most dangerous.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.800]   So the idea of having the negative affect under control,
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:24.800]   having the understanding and the control mechanisms, right,
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:27.840]   keeps us from getting to that broader level,
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:30.700]   the level of you and then working in ways
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:34.360]   that are not pro-social but are anti-social
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:37.720]   and this I think also relates to what we can find online,
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:40.100]   right, we can find online everything we can find
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.020]   in the world.
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.520]   So then we have a choice.
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:44.880]   Are we gonna work on understanding what choices
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:48.160]   are we gonna make about how we're engaging in the world
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.320]   and if we're choosing the good things,
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:51.920]   we're taking better care of ourselves
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.840]   and we're better citizens of our relationships,
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:57.860]   of our family units and ultimately of our societies.
[02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:02.920]   - I've observed anger directed my way, certainly.
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:05.040]   I'm far, far from perfect.
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:07.360]   I have thousands of flaws and I've directed anger
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:09.580]   towards others in ways that I wish I hadn't.
[02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:13.360]   A common observance I've had about myself and others
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:17.780]   is that when angry, a lot of valuable time is wasted.
[02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:21.280]   Instead of placing my efforts within the generative drive
[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:23.960]   and creating things that I really value,
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:26.480]   the anger becomes an immense distraction.
[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:31.240]   And I've seen this a lot, not just on university campuses,
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:35.080]   but one place I have seen it is when I was a graduate student
[02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:38.320]   or postdoc, there would be some interaction
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:41.440]   either between them in the laboratory I was in,
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:44.840]   although rarely, but more often it was about
[02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:47.720]   some interaction between a student or postdoc
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:49.240]   and someone in the outside world.
[02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:51.520]   And so they'd come in and they'd be really upset about it.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:54.480]   And there's a tendency to try and support one another,
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:55.840]   which I think is healthy.
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:58.240]   But then it was like this would just continue and continue
[02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:00.000]   and the person would be like sitting in their chair
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:01.440]   and it was like really upsetting and sometimes
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:03.600]   these were really upsetting occurrences
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:07.360]   that warranted taking some time and just really stopping.
[02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:10.400]   But often I felt like things just kept spiraling up
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:12.960]   and spiraling up and it was like halfway through the day.
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:14.560]   And again, I'm not immune from this,
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:17.360]   but I observed it more than I felt it certainly.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:21.100]   It's like, wow, that's a lot of time wasted.
[02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:24.800]   Like just days and perhaps even weeks and months.
[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:28.220]   And then there's the sleep loss that goes with anger.
[02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:30.620]   I think that's one of the things about social media
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:33.020]   and online communities that's new and unique
[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:35.420]   is that it used to be when kids went home from school
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.620]   or we go home from work,
[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:39.180]   something might've happened there,
[02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:41.620]   but you didn't have access to more incoming.
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:44.940]   People weren't calling you on the phone telling you
[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:46.900]   things that you don't like or talking about others
[02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:47.740]   in ways that you don't like.
[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:50.100]   Whereas all you have to do now is pick up social media.
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:53.300]   And if you're not really deliberate in how you interact
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:56.340]   with social media and on the internet
[02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:57.920]   and which news articles you read
[02:31:57.920 --> 02:32:00.460]   and which ones you scroll past,
[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:02.780]   that could be accessible at two in the morning
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:03.700]   when you're up about the thing
[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:05.560]   that was angering you during the day.
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:10.560]   That is new and requires elevated levels of diligence.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:16.480]   - High levels of anger bring volatility and confusion.
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:19.500]   And that doesn't serve anyone or anything well.
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:22.060]   Lower levels of anger can be healthy.
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:25.580]   I'm angry at that and I want to try and make it right.
[02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:28.480]   Or I'm angry at that and I'm gonna have my say in it
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:31.120]   or I'm gonna have my vote in it or whatever it may be.
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:33.520]   Lower levels of anger, okay, they can inform us,
[02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:34.920]   they can guide our behaviors.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:37.680]   But when we get to high levels of anger,
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:39.400]   it's volatility and confusion.
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.800]   The person ceases to then be effective.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.160]   And here's an example.
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:45.500]   When you were telling me about how you feel
[02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:47.800]   when you're doing the solo podcast, right?
[02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:50.840]   And how your agency and your gratitude
[02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:53.200]   are like really in action and you're feeling,
[02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:57.160]   you're feeling the peace and you're delighted
[02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:00.580]   and the generative drive is at the fore in you, right?
[02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:02.180]   And then I had said,
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:04.860]   what if we add a little bit of anger even, right?
[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:06.700]   To kind of make you, and then your response is like,
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:08.520]   oh, it would all come offline, right?
[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:09.880]   Because there you're doing something
[02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.360]   that calls for like you to really be at your best,
[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:13.920]   firing on all cylinders.
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.680]   So even a little bit of anger is too much.
[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:19.620]   But it's a good example because it shows
[02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:22.400]   like you're able to do this thing that is so good for you.
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:23.880]   You're living in the place.
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:25.200]   If you could have all of existence
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.720]   be like you feel then, right?
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:27.560]   You would love it.
[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:29.120]   You could bring it to all the rest of your life.
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:31.360]   Like that's the nirvana we're going for
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:33.600]   and you're actively living it.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.480]   But we could throw it off and ruin it
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:37.640]   with even a little bit of anger, right?
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:41.180]   So it's an example that kind of models for us
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:43.840]   how higher levels of anger cause problems
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:47.320]   in situations that are not so rarified as that.
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:49.420]   High levels of anger, maybe there's somebody blurting out,
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:50.600]   somebody attacking somebody,
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:52.080]   somebody saying something they shouldn't,
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:54.040]   somebody making a bad decision.
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:57.120]   Anger isn't good for us at high levels
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:00.280]   and we can decrease it by making ourselves healthier.
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:03.160]   Then we make less of it and we control it better
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:06.200]   and we keep ourselves at the low to moderate levels
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:07.520]   of anger, hopefully low.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:10.040]   Again, no anger is not good, high anger is not good.
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.520]   Let's try and live in the low range.
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:13.360]   Occasionally something is very distressing,
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:14.800]   we rise up to moderate.
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:17.840]   That's where we have anger in a healthy place.
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.160]   When we set out on this journey to explore
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.920]   what is mental health, I had no expectation
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:31.740]   that you would deliver to us this incredible map
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:34.440]   of how to explore our inner territory
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:38.520]   and that you would spell out such crisp and clear ideals
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:42.820]   of states and ways of being and things to access.
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:48.960]   Nor did I know anything about the generative drive
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:52.640]   and the other drives that reside within us.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:54.160]   In thinking about self-care
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:57.680]   and in thinking about the sorts of things
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:00.240]   that people are challenged with often,
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:02.720]   I made out a little list, not just anger,
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:05.480]   but things like scared, embarrassed, grieving,
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:08.800]   dejected, tired, confused, stuck.
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.360]   And then I wrote infinite number of these.
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:17.200]   I mean, there have to be an infinite number of challenges
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:21.680]   that people face, an infinite number of circumstances,
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:26.880]   and perhaps even an infinite combination
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:29.420]   of those things that people face in circumstances
[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:32.520]   that can make it all seem like a giant oppressive cloud
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:34.040]   within us and around us.
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:39.880]   And yet what you've provided is really a path of clarity
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:44.280]   because it's a path that certainly includes
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:47.240]   a lot of complexity down in those pillars at the bottom,
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:49.720]   you know, the structure of self, function of self,
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:52.800]   but you've directed us toward looking into that complexity,
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:57.320]   looking into those cupboards as a way to arrive at answers
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:00.020]   that bring us toward more simplicity.
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:04.100]   You know, empowerment, humility, agency, gratitude, peace,
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:09.100]   contentment, delight, and this incredibly attractive thing,
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:12.760]   the generative drive that is really accessible
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:14.820]   to any and all of us.
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:17.000]   - It's there in every one of us.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.700]   - In providing this path of clarity.
[02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:21.520]   And again, I want to remind people
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.880]   that whether or not you feel you're doing well in life,
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:26.360]   maybe even in all domains of life,
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:28.240]   or whether or not you're experiencing challenge
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.560]   in any or perhaps even all domains of life,
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:35.540]   going into those cupboards is clearly of immense value.
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:39.840]   And you've so graciously spelled out how we can do that
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.540]   regardless of resources, really.
[02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:47.680]   It sounds like all it requires is a desire to be better
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:52.400]   and feel better and do better and a willingness to explore.
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:53.720]   - Curiosity, right?
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:55.840]   If I had to summarize the whole thing in two words,
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:57.840]   I would say be curious, right?
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:00.400]   'Cause curious opens the door to all of it.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.120]   Curiosity about self, curiosity about life
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:05.540]   leads to all the good things.
[02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:09.580]   - Well, what you've given us is of immense value.
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.060]   And it's something that I know that I
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:15.540]   and many, many other people are going to take on
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:18.740]   as a positive set of goals,
[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:21.300]   not just for immense challenges,
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:24.240]   but really for always, right?
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:26.900]   For living forward and understanding the past.
[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:31.260]   I mean, never before have I been presented
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:34.400]   with something that felt like it had as much power
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:37.560]   and potency to do good as this.
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:40.000]   - So that's great, I'm happy to hear that.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:40.980]   - Well, it's absolutely true.
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:45.640]   And I really want to thank you on behalf of myself
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:50.300]   and everybody else for sharing with us your time,
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:53.680]   your intellect, your willingness to build this structure
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:55.480]   specifically for this series.
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:38:00.820]   And for lack of a better word, it's so generative.
[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:02.800]   - It's, thank you.
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:07.740]   - And I'm sure that people will have tons of questions
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:10.840]   and tons of experiences of their own to share
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:13.380]   in terms of using this and they can share that with us.
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:15.860]   And that's one of the wonderful things about podcasts
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.220]   is they can put those to the comments on YouTube
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.820]   or elsewhere where really the comments on YouTube
[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:23.240]   would be the place to share those questions
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:24.940]   and comments and feedback.
[02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:29.340]   And perhaps going forward, we can explore the self,
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:33.400]   the psyche relationships and ways to improve all of that
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:37.040]   and our lives going forward.
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:39.400]   - Yes, yes, this has been great.
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:42.940]   It's been invigorating and fun and thank you so much.
[02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:45.060]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:38:45.060 --> 02:38:48.420]   all about true self-care with Dr. Paul Conte.
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:50.820]   This marks the ending of the fourth episode
[02:38:50.820 --> 02:38:52.220]   in our four episode series,
[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:54.920]   all about mental health with Dr. Conte.

[02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:55.700]   And on all those platforms,
[02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:57.740]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.380]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:00.700]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:02.780]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:04.060]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:07.240]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:08.500]   Not on today's episode,
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.980]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.340]   we discussed supplements.
[02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:14.500]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:16.420]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:17.880]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:20.180]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:40:20.180 --> 02:40:21.780]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:22.900]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:25.360]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:28.300]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:30.520]   If you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.100]   it is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:33.800]   called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:35.660]   And in the Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:38.440]   you get free podcast summaries as well as toolkits.
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:40.560]   The toolkits are brief PDFs
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:43.300]   that list off the specific science-backed protocols
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:45.660]   for things like improving your sleep, improving focus,
[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:48.100]   optimizing dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:50.580]   We have a complete summary of our fitness series.
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:52.700]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.740]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:56.640]   go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:58.400]   and provide your email to sign up.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:00.860]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:02.940]   Thank you for joining me and Dr. Paul Conte
[02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:04.180]   for today's episode.
[02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:06.400]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:08.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.900]   [upbeat music]
[02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:13.480]   (upbeat music)
