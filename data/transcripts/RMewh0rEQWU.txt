[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   I've been waiting to hear you address this question for a long time, Pastor John.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.980]   I'm glad we've gotten around to it this summer.
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.440]   It's a question that comes in from a listener named Kelsey.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.800]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.520]   What are the differences and possible similarities between wartime living and what has recently
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.200]   been called minimalism?
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   Is wartime living minimalism itself?
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.060]   Or perhaps minimalism, while broadly popular today, is a passing fad for the elite.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.000]   In your mind, what distinguishes wartime living from minimalism?"
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.040]   The little bit that I'm aware of and the little bit that I understand this newer expression
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:54.440]   called minimalism, it seems to me to be a loose trend in our culture to own fewer things
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.280]   and strip down the complexities of life to the basics, largely driven by a desire for
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.080]   greater self-realization, greater happiness.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640]   The New York Times describes one advocate like this.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.280]   He gave up his permanent home, life goals, and negative emotions.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.680]   He threw away his college diploma, which had been gathering dust in storage.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.340]   Quote, "I don't hold on to all the things society tells me to hold on to."
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.600]   He now carries nothing but a bag of clothes and a backpack containing a computer, an iPad,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   and a smartphone.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.160]   "I have zero other possessions," he writes, and thanks to this, he has found peace as
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.400]   a wandering techno-ascetic Silicon Valley's version of Zen monkhood.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   It goes on like this, "From tiny houses to micro apartments to monochromatic clothing
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.360]   to interior decorating trends, picture white walls interrupted only by succulents, less
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.720]   now goes further than ever.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.960]   It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the minimalism glut," it's kind of a funny phrase, "as
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.280]   the word can be applied to just about anything.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.560]   The nearly four million images tag minimalism on Instagram include white sneakers, clouds,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.200]   the works of Mondrain, neon signs, crumbling brick walls, and grassy fields.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.980]   So long as it's stylish, austere, it seems it's minimalist.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.040]   Minimalism is now conflated with self-optimization."
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.840]   So that's a glimpse from the New York Times about what we're talking about.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.080]   So it appears that it's no single trend or movement, but a kind of a loose set of tendencies
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.680]   in our culture to react against the complexities and pressures of ownership and maintaining
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.140]   lots of stuff in the modern world that sap our strength, make us feel like slaves to
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.760]   our possessions rather than masters of our fate.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   And of course, at 71 years old, this is not the least bit new to me.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.940]   In the '70s, I can remember so clearly because I was part of it, there was a great outburst
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.680]   of simple living literature just being rolling off the press for same kinds of arguments,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.000]   same kinds of things with not as much technology to deal with.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.060]   And I suspect this will last for a while and then fade until another form of the same reaction
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.480]   and tendency breaks out.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.160]   So Kelsey's question, I think, is how does this recent expression differ from wartime
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   lifestyle?
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.680]   And I've been talking about wartime lifestyles for about 30 years.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.580]   I think first came out of my preaching in the mid '80s or so, and it had a very definite
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.240]   origin, which I'll mention in a minute.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.700]   So let me say six things about what I mean by wartime lifestyle.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:14.060]   And I think with every one of these six, it will be manifestly clear how, in terms of
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.700]   worldview, at least, it differs from the current minimalist fad.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:28.860]   First, a wartime lifestyle as I mean it is rooted in a view of this world as created
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.420]   by God and intended by Him to be subdued, as Genesis 1 says, "For the glory of God
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:46.460]   and good of mankind," and to be enjoyed when received with thanksgiving to God and sanctified
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.560]   by the Word of God in prayer, as Paul says in 1 Timothy 4, 5.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.600]   So any kind of austerity pursued in a wartime lifestyle is not based on any intrinsic evil
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.100]   in the created world.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.260]   That's number one.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.060]   Number two, a wartime lifestyle is rooted in the biblical conviction that since the
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:21.500]   fall of the world into sin and into futility and corruption, a war has been going on of
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.060]   the most serious kind between God and Satan, between God's purposes of redemption and
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.140]   Satan's purposes of destruction.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.860]   So we read, Ephesians 6, "Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.900]   against the schemes of the devil, for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.700]   rulers, against authorities, against cosmic powers over spiritual darkness, against spiritual
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.040]   forces of evil in the heavenly places."
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.120]   So take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.760]   having done all to stand firm.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:09.520]   So one of the aims of wartime teaching, as I have tried to represent it, is to wake up
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.260]   the church in many places, especially in the West, that has simply settled in to a peacetime
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.520]   mentality with no sense of urgency of the war that we are really in.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.600]   I mean, if you took the temperature, the military warfare temperature of the average Western
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.520]   Christian, I doubt that it would sound too urgent.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:46.440]   Number three, third, since we are fallen now and sinful in our desires, the world, the
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:54.400]   God-created world around us with all of its cares and pleasures is not only a created
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   good to be subdued and enjoyed, it is a danger to be guarded against.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:09.360]   So Jesus in the parable of the soils tries to explain why so many people don't mature
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.080]   in hearing the Word of God, and soil number three goes like this, "As for what fell among
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:24.040]   thorns, they are those who hear the Word, but as they go on their way, they are choked
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.240]   by the cares and riches and pleasures of life."
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.560]   He's not just talking about sinful ones.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.080]   And their fruit does not mature.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.560]   In other words, the ordinary riches that John Piper has all around me, the ordinary pleasures
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.600]   of life are not simply good.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.760]   They are also mortally dangerous to the soul.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:03.080]   The wartime lifestyle puts us on red alert not to be naive that God's good creation is
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   now only good.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.880]   Because of our sin and because of Satan, anything good can destroy us.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   A wartime footing is essential, lest the enemy of our souls get the upper hand.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:27.320]   Number four, therefore, Jesus calls us to a real self-denial in following Him.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.440]   "Whoever would come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:41.640]   In other words, genuine discipleship in this kind of embattled world necessarily includes
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.160]   self-denial.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.480]   We have died with Christ.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.560]   Our lives are hidden with Him in God.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.600]   We are now exiles and sojourners on the earth.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.800]   Our true wealth is in heaven.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:00.640]   Our aim here is to glorify Christ by showing Him to be supremely valuable, not our possessions.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.720]   And all of that is going to imply a certain kind and level of self-denial.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.240]   Number five, and this is where the truth of wartime living really took root and came from
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:26.640]   in my teaching 30 years ago, the aim of wartime living is not that we go without, but that
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:36.680]   we are able to accomplish more things by a reallocation of resources from self-gratification
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.520]   to missionary penetration.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   That's where it began.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   It began with Ralph Winter.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.480]   Ralph Winter, bless his heart, one of my favorite missionary heroes, who's now with the Lord,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.080]   a great statesman in his day, huge influence on me, pointed out that in the Second World
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:02.240]   War, the luxury liner, ocean liner, Queen Mary, was transformed into a troop transport.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:09.880]   This is wartime use of a luxury liner, and he described in detail the dramatic changes
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.840]   for how many people slept in a room, like 12 instead of three, and the kind of utensils
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.240]   that were used in them in the now-called mess hall instead of the beautiful dining room,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:28.040]   and on and on, creating a sense for us that during World War II, there were changes.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.120]   Life didn't just go on as usual.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:41.000]   And he stressed that God's people in a prosperous land like America simply cannot live as though
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.720]   there were not thousands of unreached people groups remaining to be reached who were under
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.000]   enemy control.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.360]   And we have, from our commander-in-chief, a commission to go, and we have the most powerful
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:07.160]   liberating bomb in the world called the gospel, and therefore to just carry on our lives in
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   this country as though it were a peacetime shows how out of touch we are with biblical
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.960]   reality.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   And the last thing, number six, the New Testament makes abundantly clear that in fact, in all
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:31.120]   our recognition of satanic reality and in all of our awareness of the danger of riches
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.680]   in this world and in all of our embrace of self-denial and in all of our pursuit of missions
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:48.600]   and the reallocation of our resources, we find, in fact, the greatest joy, both in this
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:56.000]   world and in the world to come, because Jesus said, "It is more blessed to give than to
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.760]   receive."
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.200]   More joyful to advance the cause of Christ than accumulate wealth and comforts.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.560]   When God calls us to the Calvary road, this is why Desiring God exists to make this point.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   When God calls us to the Calvary road of cross-bearing and ministry, he calls us on to the road of
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:30.920]   maximum joy, even if it costs us our lives, and Jesus made that clear in Matthew 13, 44,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.120]   with that little favorite parable that we love.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.520]   The kingdom of God is like a treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.560]   and then in his joy, he goes and sells everything that he has.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:52.680]   And I'm sitting here waving my arms because this is just so much what I want.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.600]   I want to be one who knows how much I need to sell, how much I need to give away, not
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:06.200]   because I'm going to be unhappy, but because this is the path to true joy.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.080]   In his joy, in his joy, he embraces the lifestyle that will glorify God, rescue people from
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.680]   suffering, especially eternal suffering.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.960]   So that's the goal of wartime living, glory of God, the good of other people, and our
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   joy.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   Amen.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   That is so good and relevant.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.600]   Thanks for bringing all of this into a contemporary discussion on minimalism, Pastor John and
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   Kelsey.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   That is a great question.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.120]   Thank you for prompting this conversation here on the podcast.

[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.720]   Well in the life of this podcast, we have talked about the TV show Game of Thrones.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.560]   We've talked about nudity in television and film.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.580]   But next time we're going to field a question from a listener on the topic of television
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.880]   drama and humor, all the other shows that seem like innocent fun.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.640]   For the Christian, what are the questions we should be asking before we binge a Netflix
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.920]   comedy?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.680]   That is the question on the docket for Monday.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.720]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.000]   We'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
