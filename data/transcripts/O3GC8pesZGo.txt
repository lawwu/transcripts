[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   Well, on Friday, we ended the week talking about the physical origins of Jesus and how
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.760]   the miraculous conception happened biologically.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.460]   Today we move to a question of what divine attributes were necessary for Christ to lay
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.920]   down in order to take up his humanity.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.160]   The question comes from Matthew in Vienna, the capital of Austria.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160]   Hello, Matthew.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160]   Thank you for writing in.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   Pastor John, thank you for all your work over the years of ministry.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   My small group recently considered the subject of Jesus's divinity and humanity.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680]   I looked through Desiring God's Resources and found a sermon that you delivered way
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.880]   back in 1981.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.000]   In that sermon on Luke 2.52, you state this, "Our text has important implications for
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.680]   understanding the divinity of Christ.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.600]   It helps us understand what Paul meant when he said, 'Though he was in the form of God,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.120]   he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.320]   the form of a bondservant.'"
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720]   That's Philippians 2, verses 6 and 7.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.600]   "One of the things Christ emptied himself of was omniscience," you said.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.520]   Later, regarding the attributes of God, you said this, "They were his potentially, and
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.680]   thus he was God, but he surrendered their use absolutely, and so he was man."
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.000]   Now, my question is, how do you now understand Philippians 2, verses 6 to 8, and Luke 2,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.320]   verse 52?
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.720]   Do these texts really necessitate that some attributes of the eternal, divine nature of
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.680]   Jesus must have been given up or laid down at his incarnation?
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.440]   Pastor John, what would you say to Matthew?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.240]   Well, I'm glad this question is asked, and I'm glad they quote my old sermon, because
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.880]   the first thing I would say is that I would speak today with more precision and care than
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.320]   I did in those sentences.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.800]   As I read those, I went back and read them in context, I thought, "Oh, that was not very
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.140]   careful."
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.620]   When we say things about Jesus Christ after the incarnation of the eternal, divine Son,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.360]   we have to be careful not to give the impression that the divine nature of Christ has the same
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.000]   limitations that the human nature of Christ does.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.120]   And I don't think I made that distinction clear enough in 1981.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:48.020]   I would not want to say, for example, that Christ, in his divine nature, emptied himself
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.760]   of any essential divine attribute, and I think omniscience is an essential divine attribute.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   So when in Matthew 24, 36 Jesus says that not even the Son knows the time of Jesus'
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:14.320]   return, I take him to mean that the Son, Jesus Christ, considered in his human nature, operates
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.640]   with a kind of limitation, but not the divine nature.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.560]   Now I know that sounds weird.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.600]   That sounds strange.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.240]   And it is strange.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.280]   It is strange, because the union of two natures in one person, one divine and one human, is
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   beyond our experience, and will always be beyond our personal experience.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.800]   We're never going to be God, and we may expect it to sound strange.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   So how then do I understand Philippians 2, 5-8 and the emptying of himself?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.480]   Let me read the verses so we all have it in front of us.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.720]   Though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant and being born in the likeness of
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   men.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.740]   death, even death on a cross.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:33.040]   So verse 6, you have the preexistent Christ before incarnation in the form of God, which
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.720]   the next phrase defines as "equality with God."
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:47.000]   Then in verse 7, you have him taking the form of a servant in the likeness of men.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.880]   And I think just as the term "form of God" in verse 6 does not mean less than God because
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.820]   of the term "equality with God," in the same way the term "form of a servant" or "likeness
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.940]   of man" in verse 7 does not mean less than human, but rather equal with all humans.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.040]   That is a real human nature.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.640]   Upshot, Christ is very God and very man.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:24.360]   And in between those two statements, you have this famous phrase, "He emptied himself."
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.480]   What does that mean?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:35.800]   I don't think it means that Christ in his divine nature became less than fully divine.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.060]   In other words, he didn't empty himself of deity.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.680]   One of the reasons I don't believe that is what Paul meant is because he says the very
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.840]   opposite in Colossians 2:9.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.040]   He said, "For in him," in Christ, "the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.640]   You even wonder whether he used the word "fullness" there partially to say he didn't empty himself
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   of that.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.400]   He's not empty, he's not only not empty, he's full.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.680]   He's full of deity.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.440]   The whole fullness of deity dwells bodily in Jesus.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.340]   So I don't think he emptied himself of anything that constitutes the essence of deity.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.200]   I think the best clue for how to think about the emptying probably comes from John 17,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:36.080]   5, where Jesus says, "Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory that I had
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.720]   with you before the world existed."
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.320]   So John had already said in John 5, 18 that the Jews recognized that Jesus was making
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.340]   himself equal with God.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.920]   So on the one hand, the incarnate Christ in the Gospel of John has a divine nature.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.560]   He's fully God.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.920]   On the other hand, there were aspects of his glory which he had laid aside, and that's
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.440]   why he's praying, "Father, restore to me the glory I had with you before the foundation
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.880]   of the world."
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   And I think that would include at least the privileges of deity that stand between the
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.320]   divine Christ and the shame and degradation and suffering and death of the cross.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   That's the point.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.080]   That's the point of Philippians 2, 5 to 8, that he moved from such height to such shameful
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   degradation on our behalf.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.960]   And that's the mindset we're supposed to have as we serve others.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   But then again, I need to qualify and say it would be a mistake to say that he laid
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.880]   aside all of the divine glory in becoming man, because in John 1, 14 it says, "The
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.960]   Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.640]   Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:12.040]   So there was a divine glory in the incarnate Christ for those who had eyes to see.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.440]   But the fullness of divine glory, I think, would have incinerated sinners and blinded
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.000]   everyone.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.640]   And this he emptied himself of.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.920]   Maybe the best way to say it is that whatever stood between the fullness of the divine glory
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.280]   before the incarnation and the suffering and shame and degradation and death of the cross,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.760]   whatever stood between there, that had to be laid aside so that he could do it.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.040]   And the only thing I would say now with regard to Luke 2, 52, which was mentioned in the
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.680]   question, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man," the
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   only thing I'd say there is Jesus was in his human nature fully man.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.400]   And therefore he grew, he grew up through the stages of childhood like other humans
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.200]   and yet without sin.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 2, 5, "There is one God and there is one mediator between God
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.280]   and men, the man, human, Christ Jesus."
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.540]   So in his divine nature, Christ was fully God.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.760]   In his human nature, he was fully man.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.220]   In his divine nature, he had all the essential attributes of God during his incarnation.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:47.500]   And in his human nature, he was finite and could therefore grow in wisdom and stature.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:56.140]   Just by way of conclusion, no book in the Bible exalts the deity of Christ better than
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.580]   the book of Hebrews.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.820]   Of the Son, he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever," Hebrews 1, 8.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:14.540]   And no book stresses the humanity of Christ for the sake of his sympathy with our weaknesses
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.440]   like Hebrews does.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.200]   Chapter 4, verse 15, "We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.860]   weaknesses but one who in every respect was tempted like we are.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:35.620]   Therefore in this Advent season, let us do exactly what Hebrews 4, 16 says.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.180]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.340]   and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.380]   We have a great divine and human Savior."
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   Amen.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.380]   Amen.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.500]   What a profound mystery here and beautifully approachable too.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.300]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that answer.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.660]   Matthew, thanks for the very good question.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.380]   Thank you to everyone who listens.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.140]   Thank you for making the podcast part of your Advent season this year.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.700]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive and even
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.180]   reach us by email with a question of your own, even questions about maybe something
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.740]   you've seen in an old John Piper sermon that you would love to have clarified by him.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.220]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:33.500]   Well there's a great danger in worshipping gifts more than the gift giver.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.660]   That of course is idolatry.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.980]   And this topic is especially important in a season of gift giving like this one that
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.420]   we're in the midst of.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.220]   So how do we love the giver more than his gifts?
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.020]   And of course we're talking about our relationship to God and God as the giver.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.620]   That is next as we ask and answer some Christmas related questions in the podcast this year.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.940]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.940]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.860]   We'll see you next time.
