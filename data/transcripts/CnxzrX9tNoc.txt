[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620]   So live from an undisclosed location with the sultry filter on
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.960]   Very sultry filter on
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.680]   Having a great hair day. Yeah, that is a good hair day for you. Great hair day my pal
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.360]   and your
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.040]   Favorite CEO and Twitterer, Mr. Elon Musk. How you doing pal?
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.040]   *applause*
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:50.700]   Appreciate you coming to the event and coming zooming in. Yeah, what's new in your world?
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700]   *laughter*
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.420]   Well, let's see, I guess right now I'm sort of debating the number of bots on Twitter
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.420]   With Paragh on Twitter
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.960]   and
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.220]   The currently I'd like the what I'm being told is that the there's just no way to know the number of bots
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.380]   It's like as unknowable as the human soul basically
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380]   *laughter*
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.060]   *laughter*
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.620]   So
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.120]   *laughter*
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.620]   You have no idea what level of witchcraft and alchemy is needed to determine these buzz bot percentage
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.620]   *laughter*
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.620]   Have you determined
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.820]   I said like why not try calling people but I haven't got a response, you know, like if you try calling people or something, you know
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.820]   *laughter*
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.320]   Like maybe try that
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   Can they answer? It's not a bot?
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.740]   No, no, no, I don't know
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.500]   But I think like that would be one of the things to do to say like
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.560]   Have you tried calling them as opposed to trying to read the tea leaves here? That's like impossible, you know
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.060]   *laughter*
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.700]   Obviously you can have an account that looks exactly like a human account or is being operated where one person is operating a thousand accounts or something
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.220]   But that person can only buy one toaster. They're not gonna buy a thousand toasters
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.520]   So you care about like number of unique real people that are on the system
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.840]   It's extremely fundamental and anyone who uses Twitter is well aware that
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.640]   the comment threads are full of spam scam and
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.940]   Just a lot of you know fake accounts. So
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.940]   It seems beyond
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.580]   Beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that the number of
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.580]   *laughter*
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.000]   Essentially the number of real said another way the number of real unique humans
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.580]   *laughter*
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.460]   That you see making comments on a daily basis on Twitter is above 95%
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.480]   That is what they're claiming. Does anyone have that experience?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.980]   Exactly
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.480]   I mean
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   Really?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   *laughter*
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   There's a bridge I'd like to sell you, you know
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   And also you can buy the Brooklyn Bridge
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   What do you think it is?
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   What do you think it is?
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   If it's not 5% what is it?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   I think it's a number that is probably at least
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   4 or 5 times that number
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   I'd say at if you did sort of the lowest estimate would be probably 20%
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   And this is a bunch of quite smart outside firms have done analysis of Twitter and looked at the sort of daily users and their conclusion is also about 20% but that's a lower bound it's not an upper bound
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   If you look at say
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   The most liked tweets on Twitter
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   So I have the honor of
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   *laughter*
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   Having the most liked tweet of any living human
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   This is
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   Thank you everyone for liking my tweet
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   But that tweet is less than 5 million likes
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   It's like 4.7 or something like that
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   And that was the
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   Where I tweeted about
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   That next time buying Coca-Cola
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   To put the cocaine back in
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   It's definitely
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   It's clearly something that the public really wants
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   You know Coca-Cola corporation
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   Should really think about going back to their roots
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   Coca-Cola
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   I mean this I guess is the reason
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   Why our grandparents could
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   Sort of walk 20 miles in the snow
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   Because they had Coca-Cola with cocaine
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   *laughter*
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   Anyway that's
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   That's literally the most popular tweet
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   *laughter*
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   Of any living human
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   And but Twitter says
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   The daily
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   The sort of monetizable daily active users is
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.480]   117 million
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   So why would it be
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   That the most popular tweet
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   Ever basically is
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   Only you know 2
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   2.5% of the entire
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   User base
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   This seems
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   A very very low number
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   *laughter*
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   And
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   The most popular tweets generally are clustered around that
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.480]   Sort of 4 million
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.480]   Like level so it's sort of
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Basically 2% or less than 2%
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   Of the
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   Daily active users
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   And technically monetizable daily active users
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   Is how Twitter refers to it so it just seems
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   How is this possible
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   Surely there's something that maybe
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   You know 10%
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   Of people would like not merely 2%
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   Well actually
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   You know if you think about it Elon
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   There's a corollary on YouTube
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.480]   What do what's the total user base of YouTube
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   And what have the most popular videos
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480]   Gotten there
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   And I think there's a billion or two
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   Billion people using YouTube
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   And those the most popular videos have
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.480]   Tens of billions of views
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   That might be instructive
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   Exactly that ratio makes a lot more sense
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480]   So
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   Something doesn't add up here
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.480]   And my concern
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   Is not that is it like
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   You know is it 5 or
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   7 or 8% but is it
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   Potentially 80%
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   Or 90%
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   But you know
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   Is it I mean
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   I certainly know there's some real people on Twitter
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   But what's
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   Is it an order of magnitude
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   Is it 50% instead of 5
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   And that's obviously an incredibly material number
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   Especially since Twitter
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   Relies primarily on brand advertising
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   As opposed to specific
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   Click through advertising
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   Where you make a purchase
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.480]   If you make a purchase
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   It doesn't really matter that much
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   But for brand advertising which is really just awareness advertising
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   It matters if real humans are seeing that or not
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   Yeah
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.480]   And so
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   I guess stepping back for a second
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   People are curious why
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   You want to buy Twitter
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.480]   Why is this so important to you
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.480]   And then I guess what are the chances
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   You think the deal gets done at this point
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   So a two-parter
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   Why is it so important to you
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   I mean some of this I've articulated before
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.480]   But I think there's a need for
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   A public town square
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   Digital town square
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   That where people can debate
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   Issues of all kinds
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   Including the most substantive issues
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   And in order for
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   For that to be the case
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   You have to have something that is as broadly inclusive as possible
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   That has as much of the
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   The people on the platform as possible
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   Where it's
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   It feels
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.480]   Balanced from a political standpoint
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   It's not biased one way or the other
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   And where
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   The system is transparent
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   This is why I think it's important to put the algorithm on
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   On GitHub and actually
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   Allow the public to see it and critique it
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   And improve it
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   And if there are any manual changes
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   Sort of shadow banning as it's called
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   Or
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   Increasing or decreasing the prominence
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   Of a tweet that's done manually
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   That that should be noted
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   So you know what has happened
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   And it's not just
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   You know
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   Where it is right now
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   Where you don't know what the heck is going on
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   Why is one tweet doing well
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   Why is another tweet not
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   Is it the algorithm? Did someone manually intervene?
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   Or is it the algorithm that's banned
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   With no recourse apparently
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.480]   And
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   You know the reality is
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   That Twitter at this point
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   You know has
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.480]   A very far left bias
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   And I would classify myself as a moderate
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   Neither Republican nor Democrat
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   And in fact
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   I have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   Historically overwhelmingly
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   Like I'm not sure
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   I might never have voted for Republican
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   Just to be clear
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   Right
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Now this election
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   I will
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   *laughter*
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   *laughter*
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   Hold on hold on hold on
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480]   David you okay?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   Keep going keep going he's fine
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   We're going to resuscitate him
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   We're going to resuscitate David Sachs
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.480]   I mean let me ask you a personal question
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   The point I'm trying to make is that this is not some sort of attempt to
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   You know it's not some right wing takeover
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   As say people on the left may fear
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   But rather a moderate wing takeover
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   And an attempt to
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.480]   Ensure that people of
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   Of all you know
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   Political beliefs feel welcome
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   On a digital town square
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   And they can express
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   Their beliefs without fear of being
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   Banned or shadow banned
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   And that we obviously
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Need to get rid of the bots
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   And scams and trolls and people that are
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   Operating huge bot armies
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.480]   And attempt to
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   Unduly influence the
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   Public opinion so
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   This is what I think it's very important that we have that
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   Like the
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.480]   Some of the smartest people
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   In history have
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   Thought about it and said like
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   Free speech is important
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   For a healthy democracy it is important
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   And free speech only matters
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:33.480]   Like say when does free speech matter most
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   It's when someone
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   When it's someone you don't like
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   Saying something you don't like
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   That's when it actually matters
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   So
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   You know
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   Obviously and it's pretty annoying
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   When someone you don't like says something you don't like
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   That's bad
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   But it's actually a good sign of
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   That you have
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   Free speech
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   So I mean I get trashed by the media
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   All the time it's fine I don't care
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Do it twice as much
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   I couldn't care less
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   But it's indicative of the fact that even though
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   You know I have like a lot of resources
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   I do not actually have the ability
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   To stop the media from trashed it
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   And that's actually a good thing
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   Yeah I have to ask
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   With regard to this current administration
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   I know how hard you work
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   On the car company
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   And then Biden
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   You know you've been a life long
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   Democrat you've donated to Obama
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   And to everybody probably never voted Republican
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   And yet
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   And the same is true for Joe Rogan
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   Joe Rogan is you know
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.480]   A Bernie Sanders supporter
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   And that the Democratic party
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Has been openly hostile to Joe Rogan
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   And Biden
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   Can't even say the word Tesla
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.480]   Or invite you to the White House
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   When they do an EV summit
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   I'm curious just on a very personal basis
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   What does it feel like to have that experience
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Where the party you supported
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   Won't even say the name of your company
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   Or invite you there
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   They should be celebrating the work you're doing
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   Yeah I mean it definitely feels like
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   This is not right
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   The issue here is that
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   There's just
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   The Democratic party is
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.480]   Overly controlled by the unions
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   And by the trial lawyers
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   Particularly the class action lawyers
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   And generally if you'll see something
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.480]   That is not in the interest of the people
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   On the Democrats side
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   It's going to come
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   Because of the unions
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Which is just another form of monopoly
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   And the trial lawyers
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   That's where actions will be happening
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   From the Democrats side
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   They're not in the interest of the people
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   And then to be fair
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   On the Republican side
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   If you say
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   Where there's something not ideal happening
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   It's because of corporate evil
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   And religious zealotry
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   That's generally
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   Where the bad things will be coming from
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.480]   On the Republican side
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   That are not representative of the people
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.480]   So in the case of Biden
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.480]   He is simply too much
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   Captured by the unions
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   Which was not the case with Obama
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   So in the case of Obama
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   You could have
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   He was quite reasonable
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   And I think he took more of a view
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   That obviously
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   You take the concerns of the unions into account
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   But there are bigger issues at stake
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   And unfortunately Biden does not do that
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   Elon I have a Tesla question
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   I read today
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   It's incredible
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   There was a Bloomberg article
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.480]   That said the following
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   So the setup is this
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   It said since you went public
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480]   Tesla is up 22,000%
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   11/4 of sequential profitability
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   So hitting on all cylinders
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   And you're talking about analysts
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   That's a car joke
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   That's a combust
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   We're stepping on the gas pedal
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.480]   Firing on all cylinders
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   People charged
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   But analysts
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   When they put out their projections
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   Okay
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.480]   It's one of the most enormous bans
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   For any company in America
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   The price targets for Tesla
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   Despite all of this success
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   Some have it at 200
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   Some have it at 1600
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   You tweeted
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.480]   A couple of months ago
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   Tesla is not a company
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   It's like six companies inside of a company
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   Like you've had to build
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   Yeah maybe more
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   Can you just explain to people
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   All these companies inside this super company
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.480]   Just so folks have a sense of what had to be done
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   To get here
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   Okay I mean this question requires thought
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   And I'll probably be leaving out quite a few things
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   But if you look at say what
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   What does a typical car company do
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   What they do is they
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   They assemble vehicles
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   And they send them to dealers
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   And they manage the supply chain
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   They might make the engine
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   Or typically will make the engine
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   But most of the parts
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   Are made by suppliers
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   And a lot of the actual technology
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   Development is done by suppliers
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   And most of the vehicle software
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   Is done by suppliers
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   So the actual amount of real work
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   Done by car companies
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   What you think of sort of like a GM or Ford
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.480]   Is not actually that much
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.480]   And so they don't do
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   They don't do sales
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   They don't do service
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   So in the case of Tesla for example
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   We do
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   We do our own sales and service
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   We don't have dealerships
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   Then Tesla also has
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   By far the biggest network
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   Of superchargers
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.480]   Sort of the electric equivalent of gas stations
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   So we built an entire global supercharger network
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   Which is still the most advanced
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.480]   And by far the best
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   Way to charge your car when traveling
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   In the distance or if you live in a city
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.480]   And don't have the ability
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   To charge your car
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   Because of street parking or an apartment
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   So the whole supercharger network
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   We developed the supercharger network
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.480]   We deployed it
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   I think we have
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.480]   I don't know 15,000 superchargers globally
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.480]   You can travel anywhere in America
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   Right now with the Tesla supercharger network
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   Then
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   In terms of vertical integration
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   We
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480]   We make the battery pack
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   The power electronics
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   The drive unit
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   We
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   We actually make
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   We're more integrated in the parts
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   We actually make so much of the car internally
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   We're vertically integrated
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   Not necessarily because we think
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.480]   There's some religious reason to be vertically integrated
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   But because the pace at which we needed to move
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   Was just much faster than the supply chain could move
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   And to the degree that you inherit
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   The legacy supply chain
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   You inherit the legacy constraints
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   Including their speed, cost
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.480]   And technology
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   And then Tesla is as much a software company
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   As it is a hardware company
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   So the software that runs in Tesla
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   Operates the car, operates the screen
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   Does the charging
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   All of that stuff is developed by Tesla
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.480]   And
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.480]   So we have sort of a car, a Tesla OS in the car
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.480]   When you
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.480]   I could go on for a long time
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   And then very importantly
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   Tesla
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.480]   Has built
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.480]   An autopilot
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.480]   That can control the AI team from scratch
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.480]   That is the best real-world AI team on earth
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   And if anyone else has got a better one
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   I'd like to see it demonstrated in a car
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   The
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   The full self-driving beta at this point
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   Can
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   Very often take you with zero interventions
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   Across the bay area
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   From San Jose to Marin
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   So
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   Through complex traffic
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   It's really quite sophisticated
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   And I invite anyone to
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.480]   Join the beta or look at the videos of those who are in the beta
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   There are probably 100,000 people in the beta
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   So it's not tiny
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   And we'll be expanding that to
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   I don't know, probably a million people
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   Or a million, I don't know, on that order
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   By the end of the year
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   So it's
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   You had this slide
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   We also built a chip team
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.480]   Because there wasn't hardware
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   That we could run the friggin AI on
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.480]   We couldn't just
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.480]   Fill the trunk with a whole bunch of GPUs
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.480]   And
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.480]   You know, because
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.480]   We had a trunk full of GPUs
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   That would have been very expensive
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   And take a massive amount of power and cooling
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.480]   Just to be able to do what the Tesla designed
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.480]   Full self-driving computer can do
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   So, and we started a chip team from scratch
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.480]   Designed it, it was the best in the world
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.480]   And still is the best in the world
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   Several years later
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   And we also then developed
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   We were designing a Dojo
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.480]   Supercomputer to be able to process the
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.480]   All the video
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   That's coming in from billions of miles of data
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   Because, just sort of like the way that
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.480]   It's very difficult to compete with Google
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Because they have so much data
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   And they have all these people doing searches all the time
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.480]   And humanity is training it
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   The same is true of Tesla
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   You really need billions of miles
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   Ultimately tens of billions of miles of training data
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   Combined with a sort of
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.480]   A vast training computer
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   And then optimize
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   Inference hardware in the car
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   And state of the art AI
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   And training specialized software
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   Across the board to be able to achieve
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   A full self-driving solution
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   When he opened Tesla Gigafactory
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   Remember this six or seven years ago?
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   I'll just tell the audience a story quickly
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.480]   He puts a slide up there
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.480]   And he says, guys we're not actually building
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   A factory, we're building a machine
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.480]   That makes machines and he puts the layout
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.480]   Of the factory and it looks like a chip
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   And it was basically like
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   How you would actually lay out a microchip
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   If you were, you know, you were like a layout engineer
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.480]   That was when I first got it
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   You know, you walk in and you see what's happening
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   And you have an insurance company now you're doing insurance for Tesla
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   Owners and an Uber competitor
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   And eventually a robo taxi Uber competitor
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   RIP
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   Yeah, I mean
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   Insurance is not quite significant
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.480]   Now are you okay? I'm okay
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   The car insurance thing is a bigger deal
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   It may seem
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   A lot of people are paying
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   You know, 30, 40% as much as their
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   Lease payment for the car
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   In car insurance
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   So the car insurance industry is incredibly
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   Inefficient because they're just
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   Personally you've got like so many
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   Sort of middle entities you've got
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.480]   From the insurance agent all the way to
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.480]   The final sort of reinsurer there's like
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   A half dozen companies each taking a cut
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   And then the
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   It's all very statistical
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.480]   So that there's
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   Even if you're a very good driver like you could
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Be like, you know, 20 years old
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   And a great driver but they
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.480]   It's all statistical so you can't get
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   You either can't get insurance or it's extremely
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   Expensive
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   So but Tesla allows for real time
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.480]   Insurance based on how you actually drive it
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   So if you drive the car
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   You can actually if you drive the car
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.480]   In a safer way you actually
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   Have lower insurance
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   So ours is
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   Insurance is based on how you actually drive
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.480]   Not how you know
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   Historically people that
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   You know fit your whatever demographic
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   Have drive and then you can close the loop
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   Around your
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   Insurance rate by simply driving better and looking at
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   Your score and
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   Lowering your insurance in real time and people
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   Do it actually promotes safer driving
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   I actually have had this experience
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   Because in my household two people
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   Drive my car and one of them has
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   A 93 score and the other one
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   Does not they have like a 60 score
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   And
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   You may have met this other person but
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   I've been trying to work with her on
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   The aggressive turns and stops
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   In advance
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   Of our insurance bill
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   Which we're hoping
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   Will go down at some point
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   You didn't oh the one question
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Is this Twitter deal going to get closed
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   You think what are the chances here
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   Well I mean it really depends
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   On a lot of factors here
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   I'm still waiting for
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   Some sort of logical
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Explanation for
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   The number of sort of fake
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   Or spam accounts on Twitter
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   And Twitter is refusing to
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   Tell us so
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   You know
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   This just seems like a strange thing
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   Wait sorry
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   Are they refusing to tell you or you don't think they really know
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   I mean there's a good chance
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   They may just have no idea
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   They claim that they do know
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.480]   Yeah
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   And they claim that they've got this complex methodology
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   That only they can understand
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   Um
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   Laughter
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   But the guy who landed
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480]   Two rockets simultaneously
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   Can't understand
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   You stir this cauldron and then you throw the
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.480]   Nothin' at 'em
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   Laughter
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   Pogsworth
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   And then suddenly it comes to you in a dream
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   I don't know
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   But there should be some
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   You know
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   Objective way to
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   Because this is a material
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   Public statement
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   It's a
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   You know it's a material adverse
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   Misstatement
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   You know if they in fact
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   Have been
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   Vesiferously claiming less than 5%
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   Of fake or spam accounts
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.480]   But in fact it is 4 or 5 times that
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   Number or perhaps 10 times that number
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   This is a big deal
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.480]   It's not this
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   It seems like if you said okay
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   I'm gonna I agree to buy your house
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   You say the house has less than 5% termites
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   That's an acceptable number
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   But if it turns out it is 90% termites
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   That's
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   Not okay you know
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   It's not the same house
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   Laughter
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.480]   This house is made mostly of termites
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.480]   If termites leave
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   Literally your house will disappear
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   Because it's mostly made of termites
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   So you know that would obviously
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Just not be appropriate
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   So in making the twitter offer
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   I was obviously reliant upon the truth
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   And accuracy of their public filings
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   And if those filings are not accurate
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   It's simply not
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   It's not
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   You can't pay the same price
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.480]   For something that is much worse than they claimed
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.480]   And you know they say
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   Elon life's a negotiation
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   So at a different price
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   It might be a totally viable deal correct
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   I mean
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   I mean
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   I mean
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   It's not out of the question
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   But I really would
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   You know the more questions I ask
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   The more my concerns
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Grow
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   So
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   You know at the end of the day
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   Acquiring it has to be fixable
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   And fixable
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   With a reasonable time frame
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   And without revenues collapsing along the way
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   And all that sort of stuff
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   And so
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.480]   You know I really need to see
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   How these things are being calculated
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   And it can't be some deep mystery
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   That is like more complex than the human soul
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   Or something like that
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   It's got to be
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   You know
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   I think we can apply the scientific method to this
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   And try to figure out what's really going on
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   And
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   Twitter's revenue is primarily dependent
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   I think 70% or some of that order
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   On brand advertising
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.480]   As opposed to specific purchase advertising
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   And I think that's the thing
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   This is a big deal
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.480]   Because brand advertising is not
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   There's not a purchase that results from that
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.480]   So it's basically
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   How much mind share
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   If you're a big company
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   How often do they hear your name
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   As opposed to something where you can directly measure the outcome
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   So that
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   That means that they're somewhat going on faith
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   And if that faith
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   Is undermined or reduced
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   Because of the reality of the situation
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   Coming to the fore
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   Then Tesla's revenue
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   Starts with a T
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   Twitter's revenue
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   Will be
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   Significantly impaired
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   And that's a major problem
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   Elon did you have a chance to ask these questions
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   During your negotiation
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   The
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.480]   Like I said I was relying upon
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   Their public filings
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   So to the degree that
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   And this is normal for a public company
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   If you make a formal filing
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   That
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   That is what
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   Investors are relying upon
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   Whether they are making an acquisition offer
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   Or simply buying some shares
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   So this
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   The accuracy of these filings is important
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   Whether you're buying one share
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   Or the whole company
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   And so if these filings are inaccurate
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   Or if they're
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   Sort of potentially blatant
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   It's a big deal
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Elon do you have a sense of
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   Why this has been such a
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   Persistent problem for Twitter
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   Do they not have the technical capabilities
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   To solve the bot problem
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   Or is it more of like just
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   They've under prioritized the issue
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   Or been unwilling to because potentially
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   There are implications for
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.480]   Ad revenue
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   I don't know it's sort of speculative at this point
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   So the
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   The worst interpretation
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   Would be that they don't want to look too closely
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   At the thing because they might not like the answer
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.480]   That would be the worst interpretation
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   The
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   I'm not sure what the best interpretation is
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   But the least bad interpretation would be
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.480]   Maybe they thought it was this way
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   But the way they were doing it was wrong
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   And they didn't realize they were mistaken
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   And simply weren't paying enough attention
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   It does seem as though it should be a lot easier
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   To get rid of the bots and spam and trolls
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   Than like this is not some
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   We're not trying to split the atom here
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   You know
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   We're not trying to get to the moon
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   We're just trying to
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   Limit the amount of obviously scammy accounts
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   If it's
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   If it's like
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   A bitcoin giveaway
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   You know
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   Probably it's a spammer
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   You know like
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   Maybe you know
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   Wait you're not giving away 100 bitcoin?
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   I just sent you 10 e
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.480]   If you send me 2 bitcoin
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   I'll send you one back
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   Right?
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   What if I send you 20?
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   Actually
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   I thought one of the interesting things
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   That came up in your product roadmap
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   Or I guess this was released
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.480]   And people were like
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   Oh I'm going to use this
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.480]   And people covered it
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   Was the possibility of Twitter becoming
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   Kind of a super app with
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   Payments included
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   Perhaps even Doge or something
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   This seems to me
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   Based on your work with David
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   A PayPal
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   A pretty brilliant idea
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   What's the vision there in terms of
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   If you were able to buy it
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   Perhaps at the right price
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   What would it look like
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   If I could add Jason to Elon Musk
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   Sure well
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   For those that have used WeChat
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   I think that's
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   WeChat's actually a good model
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   If you're in China it's basically
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   You kind of live on WeChat
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   It does everything
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   It's sort of like Twitter plus PayPal
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   Plus a whole bunch of other things
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   And all roll into one with actually a great interface
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   And it's really an excellent app
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   And we don't have anything like that
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   Outside of China
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   So I think
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   Such an app would be really
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   Useful
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   And just like the utility
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   Of sort of a
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   Spam free
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   Thing where you can make comments
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   You can post videos
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   You know I think it's important for
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   Content creators to have a revenue share
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   Now this does not need
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   To be done on Twitter
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   It could be done from something that's created from scratch
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   So it could be something new
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   So really but I think this thing
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.480]   Needs to exist whether it is
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   Converting Twitter to
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   Be the sort of like
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   Kind of all encompassing app
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   That like I said everything from
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   Digital town square where important ideas are debated
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   You know maximally trusted and inclusive
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   And at a point where you sort of
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Have a high trust situation then
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Payments whether it's
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.480]   Crypto or fiat
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   Can make a lot of sense
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   You just want something
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   That's incredibly useful and that people love using
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   So
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   But it's
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   It's either convert Twitter to that
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   Or start something new those are the two
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.480]   But it does need to happen somehow
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   Well it's interesting you bring that up
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   Because the price of Twitter
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   Is pretty high
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   And you've built a couple of companies
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   And some engineers like to come work for you
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   And you've now gone through the intellectual
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   Exercise of studying all this
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   If you're looking at the two choices now
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.480]   Fixing Twitter given all these problems
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   And maybe just starting
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   Your own version which one are you leaning towards
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   Because I have watched you build a
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   Couple of companies and the products have turned out
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   Pretty good so is it easier
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   For someone like you to just start from scratch
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   I mean
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   It's certainly the
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   My default inclination is to start
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   Things from scratch
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   I mean I'm not really I don't buy things
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   There's still this sort of
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   You know
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   Um
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Like SpaceX would start up from scratch
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   You know
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   In the case of Tesla
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   You know
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   There's like five people
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   There's still this guy
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   Everhard who's the worst guy I've ever worked with
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   Who tries to claim like sole credit essentially
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   For creating Tesla
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   And if he's so damn great why don't he just go
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   You know create another car company when he was fired
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   But anyway
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   So
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   Well I mean that's a pretty good story I mean
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   Yeah
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   I remember
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   I mean no but I remember having this conversation with you
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   We were having a conversation about the roadster
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   I think I can tell this story
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   Because I think it's a pretty good story
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   I think it's a pretty good story
