[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.440]   I think we have time for one more question.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.120]   This one comes from Ezra. Ezra says, "Is it really a deep life if it's entirely focused on my
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.400]   local community?" As Ezra then elaborates, "When you talk about the deep life, it sounds to me
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.880]   often utilitaristic"—I think you might mean utilitarianistic—"in the sense that all the
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   buckets you mentioned have the purpose of making me feel good, satisfied, connected, etc. But what
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.880]   about the people we do not get in direct contact with? Shouldn't that be part of a deep life ethic,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.160]   one that urges us to care about all of humanity? Of course, it makes no sense to talk about social
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.280]   injustice and then ignore the needs of the people in our immediate neighborhood, but shouldn't
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.680]   that be a step after looking further?" So Ezra, when we're thinking about the different buckets
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120]   of the deep life, it sounds like we're honing in here on the community bucket.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   I do often talk about, when I give examples about overhauling that area of your life,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.880]   getting involved and giving back to people in your immediate community, but I think you're
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.120]   absolutely right that there are broad interpretations of community as well
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.480]   that are important. So at the most narrow interpretation, community is going to be your
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   family. All right? These are my kids, my wife, my siblings. This is a really big priority. I want to
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280]   make sure that I am serving them, I am there for them. Then we move out to a slightly broader scope
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.480]   and you get to your friends. These are people I know and like and spend time with. These are my
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.720]   friends. I want to be there. I want to serve them. Someone has a kid. I'm going to go over there. I'm
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.080]   going to help them. I'm going to cook them dinner. Someone gets sick. I'm going to be there to make
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.440]   sure that the errands get done, that their car oil still gets changed. Broaden out further and you get
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.200]   to your geographically proximate neighborhood and community. Okay, here's the town I live in.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.120]   Here's the suburb I live in. I want to be involved, right? This is where you might also have
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.840]   community group involvements. My church, a volunteer effort that I do. So now you're dealing
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   with, these aren't maybe your close friends, but people who have some sort of geographical proximity
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.120]   to you. Beyond that, relevant to your question, the scope will broaden to serving people in the
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.200]   broader human community. And this is where you might be involved in causes or issues that have
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.520]   no real relevant geographic proximity to you. I'm working on climate change issues. I'm working on
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.520]   issues with injustice in prisons or something where now you are outside of, these are people
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.360]   that are actually related to me or around me all the time. And I think that could be really
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.120]   important as well. And when you're doing an overhaul of the community aspect of your deep life,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   that needs to be in the mix. The one thing I will say though, and I'm far from the first person to
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.960]   note this, is that moving in order from the narrowest scopes towards the largest scopes
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:24.400]   is almost always the recipe for making the most sustainable long-term impact. If you jump past
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.280]   your family, past your friends, past local organizations and your geographically proximate
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   neighborhood straight to global issues that you want to be involved in, that's a risky move.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.920]   Because you don't have this foundation. You don't have this foundation of what it feels like to
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.040]   sacrifice on behalf of others. You don't have the empathy. You don't have the patience born of this
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.480]   actual, much more, let's call it human-compatible type community service. I say human-compatible
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   just because it's what we're wired to expect, to actually see eye to eye and spend time with
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.640]   the people that we are serving. You want to build that foundation, then you can better serve the
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.160]   larger causes. You get your local house in order and then you can go build houses for others as
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   well. This tends to be the right way to do it. Now the internet, because it has erased, obviously,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.440]   the obstacles of distance with low friction digital communication, has created a moment
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.240]   in which we can skip those early steps. Up until about 30 years ago, I mean, this was what community
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.280]   was going to be because it wasn't easy to be involved with a cause halfway across the country
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.080]   because you couldn't talk to the people over there. You couldn't find out about it. But now
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.840]   you can be on Twitter opining on anything, anywhere. You can be right in the mix on national
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.520]   political issues, national causes, international causes. This is really new. 30 years ago,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.200]   you might be upset with the president, but you didn't really have a lot of time in your life
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.840]   spent talking publicly about the president or what you don't like about the president because who was
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   going to listen? Your neighbors and your wife at some point would say, "Okay, I get it. This isn't
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   interesting. But today you could be on Facebook, you could be on Twitter, you could be on Instagram.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.360]   Everyone's involved at all these different levels." That opens up a lot of opportunities for a lot of
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.600]   good. It opens up a lot of opportunities for a lot more people to get involved in advocacy. That's
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   all great. But as with all things that are new, there are dangers. And I think this is the danger
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.040]   here is that if you're 23 and you jump past all those lower scopes of community so that you can
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.640]   weigh in on Putin, that is going to be an unstable foundation for trying to give back and trying to
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.600]   serve. On the other hand, if you have the patience and empathy and experience of serving your family,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.320]   serving your friends, serving your local community, and then on top of that, can really get involved
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   in something that's larger scale, something that you would have had a hard time being involved in
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   in a pre-internet world, that involvement is going to be, I think, not only much more successful,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.400]   but also more meaningful for you. You're going to be able to extract more out of it. You're going
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   to be able to approach it with more of a moral maturity. So I don't mean to turn my answer here
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.840]   into a rant, because basically all of this stuff is good. No one is going to be upset at anyone for
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   doing giving back to the community at any scale. And it's better to be doing some of that than
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.640]   none of that like so many do. But that tends to be my advice. Don't forget the old fashioned human
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   compatible, I can see you, look you in the eye. I am servicing and serving you, even though
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   sometimes you say things that annoy me and we don't belong to exactly the same tight ideological,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.840]   geographically sorted tribe. Like, yeah, my neighbor down the street is odd as far as I'm
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.360]   concerned in this way, but you know what, I'm still helping them because they're going through
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.720]   a hard time. I think it's really, really important. And we should not allow the easy access we have
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.160]   to the sort of low friction advocacy that's on unlimited scale. Don't let that get in the way
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.880]   of the harder local eye to eye community service. Do them both start with the local,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:04.560]   but then also move on to the global. That would be the recipe I'd recommend.
