[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780]   But what do you do when especially you notice that you're in this phase of feeling like there's
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.140]   too much to learn, or you don't have enough time? One is when you actually do just allow yourself
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.020]   that moment to recognize, wait a minute, what's actually going on is that I have learned more
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.080]   than I knew before. It's just that my confidence has gone down actually no more than I did a month
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.680]   ago, a year ago, 10 years ago, it helps to reframe and remind you, wait a minute, no,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.940]   I am actually getting better at this in terms of my knowledge base. And what follows knowledge
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.900]   is skill. So as long as you keep learning, you keep practicing, you keep trying, your skill is
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.280]   going to catch up with that knowledge. And so in the beginning, it really is just reminding yourself,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.140]   no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't feel easy right now. But there is value in continuing to work on this.
