[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.400]   Welcome, everyone, to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, episode number two.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.800]   In this episode, we have a special guest, Dr. David Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:38.360]   of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.760]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host of Bogleheads on Investing, a podcast made available
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.480]   In this episode, we're talking with David Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.800]   the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, who has the overall responsibility for index
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.760]   security selection as well as index analysis and management.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.540]   Before Dr. Blitzer became the Chairman of the Index Committee, he was Standard & Poor's
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.840]   Chief Economist.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.540]   Dr. Blitzer can discuss many things with us about the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.840]   the S&P, which he is the head of the committee, but there is one thing he cannot discuss.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.160]   He cannot tell us which stocks they are going to be selecting next for those indexes, which
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.640]   are highly confidential until the day that they're announced.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.400]   However, today we are going to be talking a lot about the methodology behind the selection
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.360]   of various stocks that go in and out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.680]   as well as many other indexes.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.440]   In addition, we'll talk about how the world has changed because of indexing.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   It's no longer just a benchmark, it's now an investment strategy, and that has changed
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.240]   the entire indexing industry.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.080]   Finally, we'll talk about how active managers are having a very difficult time beating indexes,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.120]   not only in the United States, but globally, and how that is expanding the use of indexing
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   and index products.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.240]   Let's get to our podcast.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.760]   With no further ado, let me introduce Dr. David Blitzer of S&P Dow Jones Indices.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.680]   Good morning, Dr. Blitzer.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.880]   Good morning.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.280]   You can call me David, and it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   Okay.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   Thank you, David.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.800]   Well, you have a lot of responsibility.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.120]   How many indexes are you following at S&P Dow Jones?
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680]   I guess two points of background to start off.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.520]   We usually talk about something like a million indices produced on a daily basis, which sounds
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   like an incredible amount, but one has to think about how indices sort of break down
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.560]   into other indices.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.720]   If you think about the S&P 500, which is obviously a single index, but each company in the index
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.280]   is categorized into a sector like technology, an industry group, an industry, and a sub-industry,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.480]   and for all those categories, we create other indices as well.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   Plus, we may have a version that's equally weighted instead of weighted by market value
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   and so on.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:36.080]   So the single S&P 500 by itself begets probably close to 500 indices, and that's how we get
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.120]   to this surprisingly high number of a million.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:48.880]   In terms of committees, we actually have about 45 committees organized by geography, by stocks
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.320]   versus bonds versus commodities, and that kind of thing.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.240]   In some cases, we run indices in cooperation with an exchange.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.960]   An example would be we run indices in Canada called S&P TSX, TSX is Toronto Stock Exchange.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.760]   There's a committee for just those Canadian indices, which has people from the Toronto
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.400]   Stock Exchange as well as people from S&P Dow Jones sitting on it.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.520]   I directly chair probably about 15 of the 45 committees, and I sit on most of the other
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   ones.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.280]   So it sounds like a lot of responsibility, especially since some of the biggest indexes
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.360]   we know of, such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are included in
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   those.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.760]   I have a question about that.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.560]   It wasn't always S&P Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.800]   When did it start to become S&P Dow Jones Industries as opposed to S&P Indices and a
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.480]   separate company called Dow Jones?
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.520]   There must have been some sort of a merger or acquisition along the way.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.400]   There was a merger, or maybe one called a combination, that was completed in the second
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.280]   half of 2012.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.880]   There was a bit of history behind it.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   To go back a ways, Dow Jones was originally owned by Dow Jones & Company, which owns The
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.120]   Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.480]   I won't get all the dates right, but around about 2005 or 2006, News Corp., which now
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.380]   owns The Wall Street Journal, acquired Dow Jones & Company.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.480]   Following that, News Corp. looked around, and they ended up selling it to the Chicago
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.180]   Mercantile Exchange, which people probably know because futures on indices are traded
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.880]   on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or the CME.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.800]   We rolled forward a couple of years, and the CME out in Chicago found itself running
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.760]   a bunch of indexes in New Jersey that had a big interest in indices also, and that is
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.240]   the futures on the S&P 500 are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or what we sometimes
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.080]   call the Merck.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   At the same time, S&P was very interested in what was going to go on because of the
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.160]   Dow Jones Industrial Average, which we knew to be a widely followed major index.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.120]   The result of a series of discussions and arrangements was that two firms got together
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.560]   and really brought a lot of complementary strengths.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.880]   There were certain ideas that people at Dow had done, which we wish we had done.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   One of the first really successful indices based on dividends was done by Dow and very
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   successful, and we've done some, but not quite as successful as that.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   They looked at us and we had been much more successful with big institutional investors
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.760]   and the 500 than they had been with the Dow, and it just made sense to put everything together.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.320]   Obviously it took a lot of discussion and so forth, but on November 1, 2012, as New
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.180]   York City was virtually flooded by a storm called Superstorm Sandy, we started doing
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.080]   business with one company.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:15.240]   Now, if I recall correctly, prior to S&P and Dow Jones doing a business combination so
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.720]   that your committee or one of your committees took over the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   it was the editors of the Wall Street Journal who were picking the 30 Dow Jones stocks.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   Do they still have involvement in that?
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.280]   Yes, they do.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.720]   I don't know first-hand the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average before 2012,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:44.440]   obviously, because I come from the S&P half of the result, but there was involvement from
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.400]   the editors of the journal, and recognizing the huge work history of the Dow, it is the
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.640]   oldest stock index that's currently in existence and still being used and so on, and the input
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.880]   that the journal provided for almost 120 years at that point, we felt it was important to
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.600]   keep some involvement with them, and so we created a committee, or maybe you could say
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.640]   continued an existing committee, called the Averages Committee, which handles the Dow
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.520]   Jones Industrial Average, the Dow Transports, and the Dow Utilities, and that committee
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:27.160]   has five people on it, three representing S&P Dow Jones indices, and two from the Wall
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   Street Journal.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.440]   Sitting on that committee and chairing it, it's not only very welcome, but very good
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   to have two people from the journal.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.600]   They bring a slightly different perspective than we do in terms of how they see the economy
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.840]   and the markets and developments in the news.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:53.280]   They're both very sharp, and it's worked out very well, and I think I'm very pleased to
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:00.000]   not just continue the role of the Wall Street Journal's editorial group, but really to have
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.040]   two very good people on the committee.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.520]   I recall a conversation we had a couple of months ago when the committee decided to take
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.760]   out General Electric from the Dow Jones.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.640]   It appeared that it was going to be a big shock that GE was coming out of the Dow Jones
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   Industrial Average, but it turned out that it really wasn't a big shock.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.840]   People quickly accepted that.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:29.200]   GE was one of the original members of the Dow, and "original" means 1896.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.080]   It had been in the first 15-20 years of the Dow, it was in and out a few times.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.280]   But probably from the early to mid-1920s, GE was continuously a member of the Dow Jones
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.440]   Industrial Average up until this year, and given the history of the company and its history
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.680]   with the index and so on, this is not something one does lightly.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.600]   Obviously, we don't take any company out or put any company in an index like the Dow lightly,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.360]   but this one gets even more consideration.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.320]   GE has fallen on some difficult times.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.960]   Various people have various explanations and so on, and since I'm not an analyst on GE
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.640]   in particular, I won't leave any of those details aside, but it had fallen on some difficult
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:26.420]   times, and I think its weaknesses were widely recognized, even though some people wanted
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   to carry it in.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:33.720]   But as we looked at it, in an index you only have 30 names, because that's the rules.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.400]   We really felt we shouldn't use a name on one stock that wasn't doing that well.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.280]   A lot of people didn't think it was going to do that well, and given the way the Dow
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.320]   was calculated, it wasn't having any impact on the index at all.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.440]   So it was not a difficult call once we sat down to talk about it.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.000]   And it's interesting you say that it didn't have a big impact on the Dow, because the
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.280]   Dow Jones is an unusual index.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:04.480]   It is weighted by the price of the stock, which the larger the price, the more influence
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.120]   or impact a change would have on the index.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.720]   And isn't this one of the reasons why companies that have very, very large prices and thousands
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.160]   of dollars may not work well in the Dow Jones 30?
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   That's right.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.080]   The Dow, as you mentioned, is unusual.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   The only other index I know of that's done that way is the Nikkei 225 in Japan, although
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.200]   I'm sure there are a couple of others that haven't come across.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   And when we look at stocks in the Dow, we'd like the ratio between the highest price stock
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.720]   and the lowest price stock to be not much more than 10 to 1.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.920]   So GE, when it came out, was probably about $12 or $13 a share.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.360]   The highest price stock in the Dow at that point was around $200 or more.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   And GE didn't have much impact that a $200 stock would have had, you know, 8 to 10 times
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.720]   the impact of GE on the value of the index.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.440]   And it just didn't make sense to do that, so we replaced it with a slightly higher price
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.200]   stock that we felt was a better representation of what was going on in the economy and the
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   markets.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:25.040]   And I think, you know, after the initial excitement wore off in a day or two, it was generally
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.240]   applauded, and I think people are more comfortable with the Dow the way it is now than the way
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.160]   it was when we still had GE in the last days.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.880]   Let's go over to the S&P 500.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.040]   I've been in the business about 30 years, and I've seen some pretty large changes to
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.240]   the methodology by which the S&P 500 calculated.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.120]   I believe back in the 1990s, there was a couple of changes concerning -- I was going from
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:00.000]   a full capitalization to a float capitalization methodology, and then there was a change is
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.760]   what stocks are actually U.S. stocks and what stocks are non-U.S. stocks.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.320]   Could you talk about some of these big, major changes that have occurred in the S&P over
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.680]   the last, say, 25 years?
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   Okay.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.040]   I think that the background that people should recognize is, you know, clearly the world
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.480]   changes, the economy changes, the way people use indices change, and so to run an index
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:36.640]   today the way it was run, let's say, in 1982 when futures trading started, would be pretty
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.400]   silly, and it wouldn't work that well, and there have been a lot of changes since then.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.800]   Probably the biggest change is the amount of money that tracks the S&P 500, which means
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:55.200]   it's a lot more visible, and changing companies makes a bigger difference and so on than it
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.880]   did 30 or 40 years ago or something like that.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:06.480]   The float change I think was actually in the early 2000s, the idea being that, well, first,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.200]   the S&P had always had a rule that for a stock to be in the index or when it was added to
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.440]   the index, at least half of the outstanding stock should be available to the public.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.880]   So if you had a company where the insiders or the founders or whatever owned 80% of the
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.800]   stock, that was nice, I'm sure they were doing very well, but it wouldn't be eligible for
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.400]   the S&P 500.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   But even with that rule, there was concern that we had some stocks that were just not
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.520]   very liquid and might be difficult to trade, especially in the lower, the smaller stock
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:48.880]   end of the index, and as trading and as exchange-traded funds became bigger and bigger, those became
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   something of an issue for a lot of people.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   So what we did was we went to float, where we go through, once a year, the proxy statements
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.320]   that companies file with the SEC, and we do our best to figure out what proportion of
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.960]   the stock is actually in the market and what proportion is locked up in holdings by insiders
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.400]   or holdings by another company, and holdings by another company would mean if both companies
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.680]   are in the index, we sort of double counting, things like Berkshire owns big chunks of various
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:32.120]   different large companies in the index, or where the stock just wasn't available because
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.760]   the founding family wasn't going to sell because they didn't want to, and so we made the adjustment
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.120]   to be what we call float-adjusted.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:47.320]   So if a company had 80% of its stock in the index, we would count that 80% to be in the
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.760]   market, and we'd count that 80% as being available in the index, and then we'd take the total
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.320]   shares outstanding and multiply it by .8, and that would be the number of shares we'd
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.200]   use for index calculation.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.920]   It was a fairly big change, although if you took the all 500 stocks, you just took an
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.720]   average of the percentage of each company's stocks or shares that was available in the
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.800]   index, that came out about 93% or something, so there were a handful of companies that
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:26.120]   were just a fairly big change, but the vast majority, we're talking about a few percentage
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:32.000]   points change in their value as measured in the index.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.760]   The domicile, or what we call domicile, which is how do you know if this is a U.S. company,
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.160]   which sounds sort of silly and obvious to most people, but it got more complicated.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:52.120]   In about 2007, 2008, 2009, two things happened.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:59.040]   First, a lot of U.S. companies started changing their incorporation to Switzerland, Ireland,
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.760]   various places in the Caribbean, Bermuda.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.480]   They all wanted to avoid paying U.S. taxes, which is again in the news in the last year
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.800]   or so, and initially the index committee, as the first two or three of these came along,
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.160]   said those violate the rules because the index is supposed to be U.S. companies.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   It's not supposed to be Swiss companies or Irish companies or whomever, and we started
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.000]   telling these companies out one by one.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.560]   We then very quickly heard from a lot of investors, some individual investors, who said, "I've
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   owned this company for 40 years and now you're telling me it's not what it used to be," some
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.940]   big institutional investors who were a little more vocal than the individual investors possibly.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.340]   So we went around listening to people and talking to people.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:58.200]   We hold an annual meeting called an advisory panel where we invite in a lot of major institutional
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.000]   investors and let them tell us what they like and don't like about our indices.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.080]   Out of that came the feeling that what a U.S. company should be slightly different than
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.720]   where do you incorporate.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.380]   The two key things that investors tell us about is, number one, how do you report your
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.380]   financial results?
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.400]   Do you report them to the SEC as a U.S. company?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.560]   Do you file a 10-K and a 10-Q?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.080]   That's from an investor's point of view.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.640]   If you don't do that, then you're not U.S.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.960]   Second of all, where do you see stock trades?
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   And there it's pretty simple.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:42.200]   New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, those are the two major U.S. exchanges that get mentioned.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.880]   Our rules now say if you do those two things and if you have at least a large portion of
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.680]   your assets or your employees or your activities in the United States, you're a U.S. company.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.440]   The last rule is there are a few Chinese companies that the only place they trade is New York
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.880]   and NASDAQ.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:10.000]   They report on a 10-K to the SEC, but all their business activities are in China, but
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   we don't think they're U.S. companies.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.760]   It's interesting what you said about going out to investors, large institutional investors,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.960]   and before you make a big change to the index, you actually speak with the others in the
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.000]   industry and you speak with large investors and the S&P 500, and you get their input into
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.920]   changes that you're considering before you make them as opposed to doing it in a vacuum.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:43.600]   Do you do that when you're looking at potentially putting a new company in, taking a new company
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600]   out?
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.400]   Do you get input from the industry?
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.160]   Yeah, I think because here the rules and the regulations have been changing a lot over
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:58.960]   the years, and so we should be very careful as to explaining what we do and don't do.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:06.520]   When it comes to considering adding a company or removing a company from the S&P 500, pretty
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.720]   much the same thing is true for any index.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.440]   Those discussions are absolutely confidential, and they're so confidential that the only
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.640]   people within S&P Dow Jones who are permitted to be involved with them are those of us who
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:29.200]   work specifically on the indices, and for those of us, the ones working directly in
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.800]   the indices, we cannot do anything commercial.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.000]   I can't quote a price, I can't negotiate a contract, that's completely off-limits and
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.840]   so on.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   So market-moving things like adding a stock to the S&P 500, those discussions, that research,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.280]   that analysis is restricted to a very small group of people, essentially the one sitting
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.120]   on the index committee that covers the index, and we don't talk to anybody until we publish
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.520]   an announcement on our website and give it to the news media, which says this company
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.400]   is being added at such and such a date, or this company is being removed.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:15.720]   So those kinds of discussions, the ones that are really market-moving, we keep them under
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   wraps.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:22.360]   Other discussions, much more general things, like how would you define what company is
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.960]   a U.S. company, for those, we will invite comments.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:35.400]   What we do the vast majority of times is we'll publish a letter or paper on our website and
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.560]   explain what the issues are and ask people to send us their comments, in fact, they can
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:48.360]   go on our website and fill out the information right there, and at the same time, if we know
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:55.440]   of investors, whether institutional or individual, who would have an opinion or be interested,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.080]   we want to make sure we hear from them, and we will send them an e-mail and say we've
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.040]   just published a consultation on this matter, and we would appreciate a response.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.880]   So we do reach out with that, but even with those, if we're doing a consultation on a
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.960]   particular question, we'll ask for a lot of input from people, but we're not going
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   to tell anybody what we're going to do until we publish the result for everybody.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:27.680]   So we're very concerned that crucial information, all investors have equal access, same time,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:35.120]   same information, and so on, and if we're toying with something that's going to be market-moving,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.840]   we're going to keep it to ourselves until we tell everybody at the same time.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.240]   That's the way we run what we feel is a fair and transparent index.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.320]   Is it fair to say that if a very large company comes out of the index, then you're trying
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.080]   to find an equally-sized company or something close to it?
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.520]   Like you talked about with the Dow Jones Industrial Average price, as far as S&P, given a cap-weighted
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.280]   index, if a $100 billion cap-weighted company comes out, are you looking for something close
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.320]   to that to put in?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.840]   I'm not sure there are too many $100 billion companies floating around there that are not
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:23.880]   in an index, actually, but for the 500, there are a series of rules.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.520]   One we mentioned already has to be a U.S. company.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:34.440]   Its market value should be, currently I believe the minimum is about $6.8 billion at a minimum
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.680]   at the time it goes in, it should be profitable, meaning on gap earnings, it should have made
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.240]   money over the last year, and that's an unusual rule for an index.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   It should be liquid.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.480]   If it's not liquid, somebody will have a hard time trading the stock, and so on.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:58.080]   Those rules are public, and the company we choose should comply and does comply with
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.600]   those rules, and so on.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:06.920]   All that's published in a thing called the U.S. Indices Methodology, it's up on our website.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   Some people may tell you it's a great cure for insomnia, but other people say it's actually
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   worthwhile reading.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   All right.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   Thank you.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:19.560]   Let's get into some big changes that have taken place in industry classifications that
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.000]   have occurred over the last couple of years, and you could probably start out with an overview
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.760]   of the Global Industry Classification System, GICS, or standards, is it, and what that is,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:40.360]   and then how does that all work into the S&P and what you're doing?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   It's a global change.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.400]   It's very large changes that have taken place.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.640]   Can we talk about that for a minute?
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.720]   GICS is the Global Industry Classification Standard.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   It's a system for classifying companies into a sector, which, for example, would be technology
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.800]   or healthcare, an industry group, and then within that, within an industry group, there'll
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   be one or more industries, and within each industry, there'll be one or more sub-industries,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   so that at the very bottom, there are around 160 sub-industries, which is a pretty detailed
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.520]   statement as to what a company does.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.600]   And it's done principally by looking at where the company gets its revenues.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.640]   We also will look at earnings, and at times, we'll look at the way the market perceives
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:33.160]   a company and that the market sometimes sees a company doing one thing even though it does
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.720]   something else that's a little bigger.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:44.920]   GICS is an effort that's maintained or run jointly by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:51.320]   We've been running it together since it was created in about 1999, and on a global basis,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.480]   I don't remember the exact numbers, but essentially, any publicly held company anywhere in the
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:03.360]   world that an investor is likely to even look at has a GICS classification, sector, industry
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   group, industry, sub-industry.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.080]   Somebody sort of wondered, "Why do you do this?"
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.600]   Well, the way investors think about markets and what moves markets is they like to have
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.080]   an idea which ones are going up and which ones are going down, because it's very rare
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.320]   that everything moves together.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.400]   So somebody will say, "The S&P 500 was up 3% last week.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.280]   It was led by the technology stocks and healthcare, but consumer discretionary lagged," or something
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   of that sort.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.380]   Those are all names of the major sectors, and people will then tell you what portion
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:46.600]   of the 3% was contributed by each sector, some going down sort of reduced the 3%, other
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.960]   ones pushed it up.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.940]   They'll look over a period of time, what's been growing fast, all that kind of thing.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:27:00.640]   So this year, people have talked about technology stocks leading the way and so on, and the
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.680]   way they decide whether that's true or not is they'll look at the S&P 500 and they'll
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   look at how the technology sector within it has done.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.520]   In fact, we calculate the S&P 500.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   We calculate the technology sector as its own index, and if you break it up into a couple
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.080]   of industry groups and industries, we calculate indices for all those as well.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.580]   So you can take that data and you can see exactly what went up and what went down in
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.160]   the market by how much, what was pushing the market one way or the other.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:44.080]   You can look at did things change over time, did certain areas react a lot positively or
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.240]   negatively to changes in government policy, just about anything.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.360]   It's really the way to take the stock market and sort of peel back all the layers and understand
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   what's going on.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.500]   So some of the major changes that have occurred in the last couple of years, real estate investment
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.860]   trusts, or real estate was part of the financial services sector.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:13.460]   You broke that out now and made it its own industry group, which would include real estate
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.060]   investment trusts or equity.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:21.340]   So you saw that as a significant enough part of the market now to give it its own industry
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.340]   classification.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.440]   That's right.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.800]   When GIC started back in '99, other than a handful of real estate investment trusts,
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.700]   there wasn't much real estate in the stock market to begin with, and we just tucked it
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.620]   under financial and figured, "Well, all that matters is what the mortgage rates look like,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.260]   so let's stick it there."
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:52.500]   Coming out of the financial crisis in 2008, 2009, first of all, everybody knew what real
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:59.380]   estate was because it had a role in the financial crisis, but second of all, as interest rates
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.500]   came down and investors started looking for income, real estate and particularly REITs
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.740]   became an intriguing thing.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:14.140]   The way REITs are structured, they tend to pay very high dividends relative to their
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.140]   size.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.940]   It was getting more understood and indeed that sector was growing.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:27.020]   So we looked at that and we said, "Real estate is increasingly important and maybe it should
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:33.300]   really be its own sector," and instead of 10 sectors, we ended up having 11 sectors.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   In the process of doing that, we did do a lot of surveys and talked to a lot of people,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.820]   institutional investors, individual investors, some brokerage firms, some brokerage firms
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:50.500]   that really focused and specialized in real estate and REITs in particular.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:57.000]   Out of that, we, and in this case, it's both S&P Dow Jones and MSCI working together, felt
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.300]   that real estate deserved to get a little more prominence and be sort of pulled out
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.860]   from being buried in finance.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.940]   The other thing is that maybe back in 1999, real estate and financials sort of behaved
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   the same way.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.540]   By the time you roll forward to the last few years, they weren't behaving the same way
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:22.180]   at all and putting them in the same sector, when one would go up and one would go down,
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.180]   wasn't really helping anybody who was trying to understand what was happening.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.980]   If anything, it was just muddying the waters, so we split it out.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:37.960]   A big change occurred here last month with telecoms and technology turning into now technology
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:45.620]   and communications, and it was very big because now companies like Facebook, Walt Disney,
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.620]   Alphabet, which is Google, I mean, some very big companies that we, the investors, have
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.460]   always said, "Well, if I want to get exposure to those companies, all I have to do is buy
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.900]   a technology index fund."
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.900]   That has now changed.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:05.860]   If I wanted to buy a industry-specific index fund to get exposure to Facebook or to Google,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.980]   I now need to buy something called communications services because it's not being looked at
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.540]   as a technology company anymore.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:21.220]   That's true, and I guess there, the background is maybe more detailed but I think more interesting
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.820]   than in the real estate story.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:30.900]   The first thing to say is, for the S&P 500, telecom had gotten down to three companies.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:37.260]   Number three wasn't very big either, so something really ought to change, but in fact, we had
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.780]   been discussing this and looking at this for three or four years going, and as we looked
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:50.180]   at it, we realized that the whole span of what is technology, what is communications,
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.500]   what's telecommunications was going to go in a whole lot of rapid change, give you a
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   sense.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.700]   Telecoms are about ten and a half years old.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.340]   Eleven years ago, nobody had an iPhone.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.340]   It didn't exist.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.740]   Nobody had a smartphone because the iPhone was essentially the first smartphone.
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.580]   Well back even a few more years, certainly at the beginning of the century but probably
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:18.460]   well in the first decade, if your company had a website, that was pretty high technology.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:24.700]   Nowadays, nobody will admit they haven't had a website forever.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.900]   How did people communicate ten, fifteen years ago?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.540]   It was a telephone, like the one we're talking about right now has wires.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.180]   Email was sort of a rarefied thing.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.660]   You had to be in a university in 1995 to have email.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.260]   It just didn't exist.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:48.460]   Nobody text anybody because nobody quite knew what that was, and probably a few people still
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.820]   remember telegrams.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.740]   The world has really changed a whole lot.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.740]   The way people...
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.740]   I remember telegrams.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.740]   So do I.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:02.540]   Maybe I once sent one or something, but anyhow, we don't want to date ourselves too much.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:08.500]   As we started looking at this and we said, "All right, what are all these things doing?"
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.740]   and they're doing communications.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.460]   Some of it's sort of back and forth two-way communications, what we're doing right now.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:24.940]   Some of it's broadcast communications, and part of communications is movies, television,
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:33.460]   streaming, anything and everything, entertainment or virtually all entertainment.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.580]   All of that is part of communications.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:41.300]   On top of that, companies are jumping from one part to another part to another part.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:46.060]   AT&T and Verizon, one of them owns a chunk of Time Warner.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.180]   The other one owns Yahoo and so on.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.060]   So this has all changed.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:59.180]   For most people, communicating today means reading about their cousins on Facebook or
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.380]   sending texts on WhatsApp or on and on and on.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.580]   So it's all changed, but it's all blending into each other in terms of the way the companies
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:15.500]   operate and on that basis, not only did we realize telecommunications, the old definition
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.940]   didn't make any sense, but we really had to understand what the new thing should look
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:20.940]   like.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:28.460]   Facebook is very much the way people communicate and it's not to say anything improper or unkind
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:35.340]   about their technology, but their real business is advertising and helping people communicate
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.620]   and Google is very much the same way.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.220]   Their real business is advertising and search.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.100]   That's the reason for the change.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.380]   Yes, I admit that a few companies used to love the technology, you have to look a little
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:57.460]   bit farther to find them, but I think if you asked them or looked at their financial statement,
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.820]   you'd discover they've been in communications for the last few years, if not longer.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.300]   Getting back to indexes in general, back when I entered the business, indexes like the S&P
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.940]   500 were not used as a way of investing or as a portfolio.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:22.140]   There was one index fund from Vanguard that was out there, which I know you probably have
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.860]   an interesting story about and I'd like you to share with us if you could.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.220]   This has become a big, big business, indexing for the purpose of investing as opposed to
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:38.080]   indexing for the purpose of benchmarking or indexing for the purpose of economic measurement.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:44.100]   With the advent of indexing for the purpose of investing, you have to go into a product.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:51.260]   That has significantly changed not only your business, but also the whole indexing business
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.860]   for all the different index providers and could you talk about the business a little
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:01.900]   bit and how things have changed because indexing is now a product for investing in as opposed
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.660]   to just a benchmark or economic measurement?
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:14.860]   Indices actually probably started as advertisements, I mean the best I can tell from reading the
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.860]   history.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:21.020]   Dow Jones started the industrials because they wanted to get people to buy their newspaper
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:26.100]   and it was a feature of the newspaper to have a number that would tell you what happened
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.140]   in the stock market yesterday.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.900]   The S&P 500 started in 1926 with something called the S&P 90.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:39.180]   Standard & Poor's in those days, there were two companies called Standard Statistics and
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.740]   they were financial publishers.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:46.320]   They published newsletters about how to invest and that's why they started an index as well.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:53.140]   The first individual investor product based on indices was Vanguard and you've mentioned
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.120]   that you've interviewed Jack Bowles and he can tell you much better than I can first
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   hand.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.360]   I can probably tell you that they didn't have much money at the end of the first year and
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.940]   everybody told them it was un-American because they were just going to be average and so
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   on.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:15.240]   We've got hordes of data that proves that the indices in most quarters and most years
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.420]   outperformed two-thirds or three-fifths of all the active managers out there.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:27.040]   So if being average is beating three out of five people, I'll be satisfied being average.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.440]   But in terms of the business, I usually say S&P 500 was present at the creation.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.560]   It was the first index in a retail mutual fund with Vanguard.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.880]   It was not the first index to have stock index futures traded on it.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.160]   It was the first one that was successful and lasted a running length of time with the futures
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.860]   at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.640]   It was the first index in the United States with an exchange traded fund with the big
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:08.120]   spider in about 1993 and it's very much still here and by most measurements, it's the biggest
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   index period.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.520]   So it really has been present at the creation.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.480]   In the process, it did turn indexing into a business.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:24.420]   I joined S&P by dumb luck about six weeks after futures trading and the 500 started,
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.160]   which also was the first year that instead of being a cost center, everybody thought
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:35.360]   it might actually be a profit center and indeed, it's become that over time.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:40.860]   And the growth has been very strong and very nice and I think it still has a great future
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   ahead of it.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.860]   I don't know.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.820]   We go through sort of different steps and so on.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:51.880]   Clearly, at the same time, the number of indices have increased, the variety of indices, which
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.260]   really means the variety of tools for investors has grown dramatically.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:03.400]   I think I mentioned earlier, indices designed to provide dividend income, which is very
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.640]   popular with investors, indices to target segments of the market.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:14.700]   We talked about technology stocks and so on, indices that focus on growth stocks or value
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.100]   stocks or it goes on and on.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:25.820]   So increasingly, any investment strategy that somebody can think up and write down as a
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:32.080]   set of rules or a set of steps, somebody else can build an index for and provide it to any
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   investor who's interested.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.460]   That makes it a little complicated because now we have to try to differentiate between
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:45.000]   traditional indexes or indexes as benchmarks and indexes as strategies, investment strategies
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.700]   where any set of rules is all you need to create what's called an index.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.460]   And included in that rules is how you weight securities, which means it doesn't have to
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.460]   be cap-weighted.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.980]   It can be weighted any number of different ways, as long as it follows some sort of a
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.980]   strategy.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.920]   So it gets a little bit confusing for investors and we're trying to come up with a differentiation
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.060]   between -- Jack Bogle likes to call them traditional indexes.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:13.680]   I like to call them benchmark indexes versus strategy indexes and there's a lot of talk
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.420]   about how to differentiate the two.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:20.980]   Do you have a differentiating term that you use for that?
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:29.980]   We probably don't have a term that can widely accept it or something like that to break
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:38.300]   one group off from another or something and inside it gets to be too much jargon.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:44.340]   People call that FMC, that means float market cap, which is what you call benchmark index.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:49.300]   But if we wrote that in all the publications, everybody would scratch their heads, so we
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   don't.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:56.860]   I would agree there's a huge number of different indices out there and there are different
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.620]   building blocks and different ways.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.900]   The two things to remember sort of as the basis is you've got to do two things in building
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.900]   a stock index.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:11.940]   You have to have a way to select the stocks and you have to have a way to weight the stocks.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.860]   If you sort of stick with looking for those two things, an investor should be able to
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.620]   get a sense of what's going on.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:26.820]   The selection talks about a certain industry or say a stock that has continuously paid
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:32.500]   dividends for the last 25 years, that tells you something about what kind of stocks people
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.340]   are looking for.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:41.100]   And then if they look at the weighting rule, they can also have some idea of what's going
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   on.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:49.660]   It's a little more subtle maybe, but if you start by saying the market is market cap weighted,
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.140]   that's the way the market is.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:58.620]   Both stocks out there together, Apple, Google, Facebook, they're big ones, they carry more
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:04.180]   weight in the market than some stock that's by size order number 400 down the list or
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.100]   number 2,000 down the list or something like that.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:12.980]   As soon as I change that, I get different results from the market weighting.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:19.820]   If I make it equal weighting, which is sort of easy to see, the little stocks can get
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.660]   more weight and the big stocks can get less weight and that will change the results.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.260]   If you want to see the impact, we run the S&P 500 both ways.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:36.180]   If I weight them by the dividends they pay, I'm going to get a lot more weight, a lot
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.640]   more bang from the big dividend stocks and so on.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.780]   It gets a lot more complicated as they go down the list, but I think you stick to weighting
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:52.940]   and selection and you'll have some idea what's going on in the market and I should add, nobody
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.860]   knows everything that's going on in the market, so don't go down that trail, you'll never
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   get to the end.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:07.340]   I know, but given how long I've been doing this and you've been doing this, Rick, I don't
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:13.580]   know about you, but I learned nobody knows everything in the market and I like indices
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.380]   because I'm not a great friend of picking the one stock that will go up this year.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.100]   Getting back to the way in which indexes are created with the selection on one side and
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:27.100]   the weighting on the other, I don't know if you recall about 10 or 12 years ago, I created
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:34.260]   this thing called an index strategy box, which showed the three different basic different
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:40.220]   buckets for selecting securities, which are basically covering the market and then screening
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.980]   the market and then a quantitative method where you pick just a few stocks as a selection
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:51.100]   methodology and then on the bottom I had capitalization weighted, fundamental weighted and then fixed
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.500]   weighted and all the different indexes that were being created sort of fell into one of
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.360]   these boxes very nicely.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.420]   It never took off, but it's the same exact, I'm glad to hear the same thing that you're
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.540]   saying now as it really hasn't changed very much.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:13.620]   Okay, I remember it in general, I won't say I remember every box in detail.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.620]   Got it.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.140]   So indexing though in the U.S. has really, seems to be the leader.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:24.500]   We here in the United States have, investors are now embracing indexing and I personally
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.060]   believe a lot of that has to do with exchange traded funds and the ability of ETFs to reach
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.540]   a much broader, wider audience in the brokerage industry and in other places.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:43.380]   But indexing and core type indexing portfolios, which seem to be getting the most money, have
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.740]   really grown in the United States.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:52.180]   But overseas, they seem to be in some places 20 years behind us, but they're getting there.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.340]   Do you see that growth just continuing?
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:02.580]   I do think the growth will continue, but I think there are some countries which you might
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:08.180]   say have an equity mentality or an equity mindset and other ones that have much less
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.060]   of an equity mindset.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   Certainly, we do business in Canada, we do business in Australia, in both cases with
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:23.420]   the major stock exchange in each country, they are as focused on equities as the United
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:30.600]   States is, their attention, their sophistication, their analysis is comparable to the U.S. and
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   so on.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.020]   The U.K. also has a big equity mentality and so on.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:42.580]   One of our competitors owns the Kingpin Index in Great Britain, we don't, but we definitely
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.340]   are active there.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:49.240]   But there are other countries, maybe Germany is one that stands out, that traditionally
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:56.220]   investors invested through banks, they held a lot more fixed income or a lot more structured
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:04.060]   products of various kinds than they held equities and invested directly in stocks, the way Americans
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.060]   traditionally do.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:10.940]   And as a result, the whole pickup in ETFs and exchange-traded funds is probably a little
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940]   bit slower.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:20.320]   Hong Kong has a very active market, China has two major stock markets, the volatility
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.720]   occasionally worries everybody, no matter where they are.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:30.200]   But there's certainly plenty of equity expansion and ETF growth in a lot of places around the
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   world.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.400]   And it seems to be universally around the world as well, when you're measuring the performance
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:44.480]   of the S&P Dow Jones indexes to active management, that's fairly universal around the world that
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.160]   you get this three out of five managers underperform.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:54.720]   Your SPIVA has really grown, the SPIVA is looking at the performance between active
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.680]   and your indexes, and you've been doing that now, I think, for 20 years.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.360]   You alluded to it a little earlier.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.240]   But that's also expanded now, you're doing more and more countries, and you're looking
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.520]   at this phenomenon occurring across more countries, and do you think that might help to increase
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.520]   indexing?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.840]   Yeah, I think it has.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.720]   We introduced SPIVA, which was an acronym for S&P Index Versus Active, it was really
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.880]   to try and establish a benchmark to compare active managers to our indices, and so on.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:33.120]   We did it in a way that we felt was fair, and so on, and it's been very well received.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:39.040]   I think the surprising part was, we really thought this was strictly for individual investors
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.000]   who didn't have access to reams of fancy institutional research.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.840]   A few years in, we suddenly discovered that a lot of pension funds from municipalities,
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.520]   you know, the police department here and the fire department there, their trustees were
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.000]   calling up and saying, "Will you send me the latest SPIVA report?"
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.120]   They were sitting down in their quarterly meetings and looking at managers they had
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.880]   hired and saying, "Why can't you do this well?"
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   And so on.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.800]   So what we thought was a low-key thing for the average guy suddenly turned out to have
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.440]   a lot more impact than we expected.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.800]   But I think it's good, reliable data.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:24.200]   Indices don't win every time, but they do win more often than not, and I guess it's
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.800]   playing the average user to come out ahead.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.200]   It's a good business to be in.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   We like it.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.240]   With that, I want to thank you so much for your time today, David, and we really appreciate
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   it.
