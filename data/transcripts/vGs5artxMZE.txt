[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Ian from Ann Arbor, Michigan writes in with an excellent question, especially given the
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.760]   summer that we have experienced in the States.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.600]   He asks, "Pastor John, when approaching controversial issues such as abortion or homosexuality with
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.580]   my friends, I've always been very careful.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520]   Even if something like abortion makes me very angry, I try my best not to show any of it
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.080]   because I'm worried that my anger will be misinterpreted.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.720]   However, Jesus makes a chord of whips and violently drives out the money changers during
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.260]   the Passover.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.220]   This definitely sounds like something that can be misleading.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.560]   People could see Jesus as unreasonable or as someone who uses violence to get his own
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   way.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.140]   Jesus's behavior confuses me.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.080]   Should we get angry at these sins that we see in culture in the presence of others?"
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.640]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.220]   Let me turn the tables on Ian and suggest that feeling and expressing appropriate anger
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:14.720]   about, say, abortion or whatever injustice may communicate more truth about God, about
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   the Christian faith, about Scripture, about Christ, than the absence of anger communicates.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.000]   Ian says, "I'm worried that my anger will be misinterpreted."
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   And I'm turning the tables and asking, "Are you equally worried that the absence of anger
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.840]   might be misinterpreted?"
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.000]   Or the positive way to ask it is, "Is it possible that good anger and good expressions of anger
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.080]   could communicate more truth than the absence of anger?"
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   Now I can think of—I did think of—seven or eight or even more ways that feeling and
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.480]   expressing appropriate anger might communicate more truth about an injustice and about God's
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.920]   relation to an injustice and about the Christian's relation to injustice than a cool, unemotional
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480]   discussion without anger of the injustice.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   And I'm going to mention those.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.840]   And before I mention them, it is important to own up to what is being felt here, what
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.040]   Ian is concerned about.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.080]   It is important to mention that not all anger is good.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:46.120]   In fact, most of it is contaminated—so contaminated that James says, "The anger of man does not
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.200]   work the righteousness of God."
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   And therefore he says, "Be slow to anger."
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.960]   And Paul says, "Put away anger."
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.320]   And so I know from experience, and we know now from the Bible, that lots of our anger—I
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.760]   would probably say most of our anger—is contaminated with fear and insecurity and ego and defensiveness
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   and selfishness.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   It's just ugly stuff behind most of our anger.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.520]   But once we do our best to get that log out of our angry eye, we hear not only that God
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.880]   is a God of anger, and we hear that Jesus got angry, and we read Ephesians 4, 6, "Be
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.720]   angry and do not sin," and we know that we can't sweep all anger away.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   So I'm not saying we should give vent to all the stuff that may rise up within us,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.280]   since some of it may be very selfish and vain and rooted in fear and insecurity.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.720]   I am saying that when we have admitted to ourselves and to others and to God that we're
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.120]   so imperfect, and we've done our best to take the log out of our eyes best we can,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.880]   there is a place to feel and express anger when we see God's name dishonored and people
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   destroyed.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.600]   And I'm suggesting that there may be as much miscommunication that Ian is so concerned
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   about.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   There may be as much miscommunication in the absence of that anger when conversing with
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.920]   friends as there is in the expression of the anger.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.800]   So here are seven or eight provocative questions for Ian to ask.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.540]   Number one, might this not—this anger, this appropriate anger—might it not show people
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.180]   how to be angry who have only had hurtful experiences of anger?
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:05.640]   It may be that our friends have never seen well-managed anger, anger that is real, well-grounded,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.980]   yet not out of control, and therefore not about to hurt somebody.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.300]   This may be a great gift to them and a great revelation to them.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.960]   If the only anger they know is the explosive "beat your wife up" anger, your demonstration
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.660]   of another kind could be a sweet gift.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:36.880]   Number two, might our anger show that good and controlled and righteous anger can rise
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.220]   from a concern for others and not just be owing to our own private lives, being frustrated?
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.820]   Most people feel anger when their personal plans are messed up by other people.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:59.940]   And showing a measured anger over someone else being hurt—not me—may model for them
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.700]   something true that they've never seen before.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.300]   Third, might our anger possibly show that there is an anger that goes hand in hand with
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.360]   love for those who we're angry at?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.400]   My guess is that most people have never seen this or experienced it.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   Anger at someone combined with love for someone, that is, combined with the desire that they
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.120]   not be ruined—in other words, yes, brought to justice, but then find mercy from God and
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.080]   become our brother, our sister, spend eternity with us.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:47.400]   Fourth, might our anger reveal the truth that righteous anger can coexist with sorrow and
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.000]   a broken heart?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.160]   I'm thinking now of sorrow over the victims or even the perpetrators.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.840]   This is not exactly the same as saying that love can coexist with anger.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:07.160]   My point here is to show the unusual emotional experience of anger and pity coexisting.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   I think most people experience or see anger that consumes almost all other good emotions.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.920]   It just devours them like a monster, so that the only thing that happens in the home is
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   anger.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.160]   You don't get anger coexisting with tenderhearted pity.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.320]   That's just unheard of.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.520]   But could we model that?
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.240]   Can we reveal that greater truth?
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.320]   Fifth, might our anger reveal the amazing truth that anger does not have to dominate
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.080]   or control the whole of life?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   I think most people experience anger in such a way that it infects almost everything they
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   do.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.240]   It sweeps through their day and affects all their relationships negatively.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.080]   Could we reveal something different and show that there is a way to experience anger in
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.760]   a focused, limited way so that other parts of our lives aren't overflowing with anger,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   like when we get home?
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.200]   Can we play with our kids?
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.620]   Can we really play with our kids in a carefree, abandoned, with joy so that we don't take
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.560]   anything away from what they need, even though we've just seen something we hate on the news?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:29.080]   Number six, might not our expression of anger over an injustice—let's just say abortion
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:36.440]   in this case—might not our expression of anger over abortion point to the goodness
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.600]   and the justice of God, whose prerogatives in the womb are being assaulted, so that the
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.400]   anger doesn't flow just from people being hurt, but from God being dishonored?
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.640]   My guess is most people have never seen anything like that.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.240]   They don't have any categories for that kind of anger.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.660]   In other words, our anger may bear witness to the character of God, who has created these
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.640]   little ones in His image and is knitting them together in the mother's womb.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.200]   And when the lacerations and the chopping begins from the abortionist, it's not just
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:16.120]   the babies that are being shredded, but God is being assaulted as His knitting needles
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.640]   are pitched aside and His hands are being thrust back from what He's been doing there.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:31.300]   Number seven, might not our anger over an injustice possibly expose the indifference
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.320]   of our friends who feel nothing?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.800]   This might make them defensive.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.080]   It might make them angry, yes, but it also may have a convicting effect when they realize
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.920]   you really care while they're all wrapped up in their video games, and God might be
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.880]   pleased to say, "I think my life is pretty superficial.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.720]   I don't really care about what's going on in the abortion clinics."
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.480]   And finally, if we really have the mind of Christ in our anger, might not our anger be
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.680]   a witness to the fact that the justice and compassion that Christians feel is not just
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.320]   limited to abortion?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:22.280]   If we expressed anger, appropriate, well-grounded, limited, controlled, real anger, not just
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.440]   over the horror of abortion, but say, "For the poor in countries where corruption in
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.640]   leaders lines the pockets of the rich but leaves the poor with no powers of productivity,"
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   or anger at police corruption, when you see a man shot in the back by police when he's
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:48.000]   running away, or a woman tasered to death while handcuffed and shackled in prison, or
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.240]   any number of injustices in the world, if we show a suitable and suitably expressed
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.560]   anger, maybe we will be bearing witness to the fullness of God's concerns rather than
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.240]   show a narrow, partisan kind of anger.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   So I'm just suggesting to Ian that he not only ask how his anger might be misinterpreted,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.880]   but also ask how the absence of his anger might be misinterpreted, and how the presence
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:33.160]   of well-managed anger, for all those reasons, might bear witness to more truth than he had
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   thought.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   So good.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.600]   That's excellent counsel, Pastor John.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   Thank you.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.960]   And on a related note, we have a question from a group of Christian friends, a group
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.940]   of Australian women, who want to know how often they should express their opinions about
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.740]   homosexual sin online.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.040]   How much is too much?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.600]   How often is too often?
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.380]   Again, an excellent question.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.400]   And Ian, thank you for your question today.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.640]   Write up your perplexing questions and send them in to us via email at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.080]   or you can send them in from our landing page at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.680]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.280]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280]   [END]
