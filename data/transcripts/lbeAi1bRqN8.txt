[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Pastor John, you have a new book out,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.400]   a little 50 page book titled Risk is Right,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.720]   Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.340]   And I wanna talk specifically to a Christian
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.280]   who's considering taking a risk.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.140]   I think we all have dreams, aspirations,
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.640]   things that we think God has called us to,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.300]   but that does not necessarily confirm
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.400]   that we should take those risks.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160]   Talk with us for a little bit about the difference
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.880]   between a right risk and a wrong risk
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.280]   and how the church and how our Christian friends
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.920]   can help us determine which risks
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.420]   God is actually calling us to.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.240]   - The church that is the body of Christ,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.480]   both corporately as we gather in preaching
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.360]   and praying and singing and confessing
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.000]   and the smaller manifestations of it,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.680]   our small group, the people around us
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.080]   who love us and care for us,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.800]   it is always playing a role in the choices we make
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.120]   about the risks we take.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.040]   Even when we don't even know they are
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.600]   because we learn everything we know about God
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.040]   and everything we know about the Bible from the church,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.880]   from our parents, from small group,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280]   from Sunday school teachers,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.320]   and everything we know about the Bible
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   and the world informs the choices we make.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.680]   And then there's the more immediate and specific counsel
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.560]   that we receive from people who have gifts of wisdom
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   and gifts of experience, who can speak into our lives
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   with regard to marriage and jobs and patterns of life
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.680]   that may seem foolish to them
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.460]   and they can help us avoid stupid mistakes in our lives,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.600]   which would create risks that are just totally unwarranted
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.440]   and unnecessary.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.720]   So that's the piece of the church.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.600]   I just think none of us should live in a bubble
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320]   where we're making all these decisions by ourselves.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   God ordained that we would be helped
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.400]   by the people around us.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.520]   With regard to what risks are foolish,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   it would be risking your life for something small
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.520]   or turning it around and being unwilling to take no risk
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.400]   for something big.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.540]   In other words, the principle is proportionality.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.160]   The bigger the hoped-for outcome for the glory of God,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.000]   the greater the risk that it's wise to take.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.360]   And the smaller the outcome, the more selfish the outcome,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.040]   the more insignificant the outcome,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   the more foolish it would be and unwise it would be
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   for you to take a big risk for that small payoff.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   So Christians use biblical criteria to discern
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.520]   what's the hoped-for outcome here
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.180]   that God is calling me to pursue
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.420]   and what's the nature of the risk.
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.400]   And then within that dynamic, that balance,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.760]   I think only the Holy Spirit can make plain
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.540]   when it's right to risk and not.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.560]   I'll give you a concrete example.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.980]   There are many times when missionaries are told,
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.980]   "You need to get out now because situations are developing
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.500]   in this culture that are gonna be very dangerous for you."
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.640]   And missionaries always face a difficult choice
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.300]   at that time, and some will say, "You're right, I should go."
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.220]   And others will say, "No, we've identified
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.580]   with these people for 20 years.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.100]   We stand with them, we die with them, we're staying."
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.380]   And I think both of those choices can be right
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.380]   because the Bible clearly says, as John Bunyan pointed out,
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.340]   there's a time to fly and a time to stand.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.020]   Paul sometimes stood and was stoned,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.860]   and sometimes he got in a basket and escaped,
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.460]   and only the Holy Spirit can make plain
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.700]   when we do the one and the other.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.620]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
