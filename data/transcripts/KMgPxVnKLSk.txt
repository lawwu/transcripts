[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   talking about an exciting thing for an engineer.
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.760]   The same Snapdragon that goes to a phone
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.840]   and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.520]   Samsung, the same, not a special one,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600]   went all the way to Mars.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.980]   You expect to have a full day of battery life.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.320]   But then you want it to not be sending data
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.800]   into 10 or 100 megabits, you want gigabits.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.080]   You want it to be able to have eight core processors.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.720]   You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600]   You want to have all of those things
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   To do all of that in your phone is an incredible thing.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.960]   - Some people raise concerns
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.520]   about there not being enough studies
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540]   about the effects of 5G on the human body.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.960]   Is 5G safe?
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.040]   The following is a conversation with Cristiano Amon,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200]   the CEO of Qualcomm,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   the company that's one of the leaders in the world
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.120]   in the space of mobile communication and computation.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.120]   That's 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G that connects billions of phones,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.280]   and the Snapdragon processor and system on a chip
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.560]   that is the brain of most of the premium
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   Android phones in the world.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.800]   in the description.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.780]   And now, dear friends, here's Cristiano Amon.
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520]   You are originally from Brazil,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.280]   so let me ask the most important question,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   the most profound question, the biggest question.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.560]   Who's the greatest football, soccer player of all time?
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.480]   - Look, everybody's gonna say Pelé,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.440]   and actually, I was born during the game
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   of Brazil and Italy that Pelé gave Brazil the championship.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   Actually, it was, my dad tells me
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.920]   that the doctor had a TV on at the delivery room.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.600]   But, so everybody will say Pelé,
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.540]   but I really like Ronaldo, the first,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.760]   not Ronaldinho, the first Ronaldo.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.880]   I really like him.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.420]   That's my favorite player.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.800]   - By the way, not everybody would say Pelé.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.640]   - Yes.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   - But we shall leave that on the table
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.400]   and agree to disagree.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.680]   - Brazilians will say Pelé.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380]   - Yes. (laughs)
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.520]   There's other countries around that region
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.120]   that may disagree a little bit.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.960]   - Very aware.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.300]   - Qualcomm is largely responsible for 5G
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.060]   and some of the greatest processors
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.800]   in our smartphones ever built.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.420]   So, we got communication and computation tech
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.800]   that impacts probably billions of people.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.420]   So, if you zoom out, you as a human,
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.460]   we'll look at humans on Earth in general,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.580]   does it blow your mind that we have these billions
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820]   of smartphones communicating,
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.240]   and each of them have the computational power?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.060]   You know, you talk about 10 billion transistors.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.740]   That's a million times more than 50 years ago
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.380]   in the best computers in the world.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.360]   Like, if you just zoom out as a human,
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.260]   does that blow your mind?
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.380]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.300]   Look, one of the reasons I think I love this company
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.620]   is we know that the technology we develop
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.460]   can change the world.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.700]   And I'll tell you one more thing.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.140]   Beyond the amount of processing power that you have now
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.740]   in the palm of your hands and being every one of the world
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.420]   is connected with broadband technology.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.780]   The smartphone is also mankind's largest
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.980]   development platform.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.580]   There's nothing like it.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.940]   - So, you respect both the hardware and the software?
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.980]   - Both.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.820]   - Both.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.860]   If aliens were observing Earth over the past 50 to 70 years,
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.500]   how do you think they would describe
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   this particular turmoil, fun things going on
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.900]   on the surface of this particular little planet?
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.540]   - We live in interesting times.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.260]   In one time, we see incredible development
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.100]   of technology for mankind.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.300]   Just what happened in the last century.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.860]   You know, from 1900 to 2000,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.420]   it was incredible development.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.700]   Just look, 2000 was 22 years ago.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.580]   How far we're coming and where we're going with technology.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.920]   It's incredible.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.580]   - What do you think they would notice?
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.340]   So, there's road networks.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.580]   There's all kinds of networks.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.340]   There's lights that keep popping up,
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.540]   cities springing up.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.300]   Like, from an alien perspective, you're observing--
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.580]   - Well, what I'm gonna tell you is,
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.980]   you have this contrast of incredible development
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.980]   of technology, but then you see some of the things
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.420]   that are happening right now,
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.700]   which is probably you would not expect them to happen
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.900]   on the 21st century, just what happened in Ukraine.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.340]   So, I think that that will be a more puzzling question
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.540]   for the aliens, I would imagine.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.920]   - The new technology's kind of impressive.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.500]   Actually, that might not be so puzzling
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.020]   because that's just human nature revealing itself
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.620]   as it has throughout human history.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.460]   - That's correct.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.900]   - Let's talk about wireless communication.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.560]   So, Qualcomm was instrumental in developing 5G.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.140]   Now, you were with Qualcomm since the early days,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   the good old '90s with the 2G.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.180]   But what is 5G, including sub-6 gigahertz 5G
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.140]   and millimeter wave 5G?
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.980]   How does it work?
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.380]   And maybe the most important question is,
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.940]   how will it change the world in the coming years?
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.340]   - When we set ourselves to develop 5G,
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.020]   and we look at this, every generation of technology
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.220]   had a problem to be solved, right?
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.620]   So, you mentioned 2G, 2G challenge,
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.180]   the challenge of CDMA was,
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.940]   can we give every person on earth a cell phone?
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.100]   That was, can you get to a technology
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.700]   that you can basically allow everyone to have a mobile phone?
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.140]   3G was about the ability to connect that to the internet.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.460]   I think 4G was broadband, and with 4G,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.800]   it was about have the ability for you to have a computer
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.020]   in the palm of your hand.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.540]   We'll just talk about that.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.180]   5G, the challenge was a little bit different.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.140]   It's how do we build a technology for a society
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.980]   that is gonna be 100% connected to the cloud?
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.860]   How do we provide a technology that is going to be
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.260]   the last mile connectivity for everything?
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.980]   So, 5G has basically been designed,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.300]   eliminate all issues with data congestion,
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.500]   whether you are in a stadium, we talk about soccer,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.900]   you were in a stadium and everyone should be,
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.340]   ability to have access to broadband.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.700]   So deal with congestion, deal with the fact
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.020]   that not only people, but billions of things
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.980]   need to be connected.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.780]   Create a technology that for the first time in wireless,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.980]   you could deliver mission critical services.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.180]   Wireless used to, up to 4G is its best effort.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.500]   In 5G, it can guarantee that you are connected
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.340]   with the cloud.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.340]   And then the last point of that is provide this fabric
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.700]   that will allow us as a society to look at things
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.300]   that are not connected and say, that's the exception.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.100]   That's why we made a comparison in the early days of 5G,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.620]   that that's gonna be like electricity.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.980]   Right now, you don't have a discussion
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.300]   about what's the use cases for electricity.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.740]   You don't talk about that anymore.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.900]   You just assume it's there.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.540]   And that's how we think about
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.420]   have everything connected to the cloud.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.100]   That's what 5G is and that's the role of 5G.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.380]   - So first of all, everything connected to the cloud
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.540]   is interesting because the space of everything
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.020]   is constantly increasing.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.540]   - That is correct.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.700]   - I don't think the refrigerator over there,
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.540]   it looks kind of smart,
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.020]   but I don't think it's connected yet to the cloud.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.500]   So this includes internet of things.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.600]   What is the full space of everything?
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.860]   - The full space of everything is,
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.460]   it's maybe going back to where you start defining Qualcomm.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.900]   Qualcomm is about communications and advanced computers
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.060]   for low power devices.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.900]   And can we make everything smart?
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.220]   You know, it can range from the robot
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.120]   you have right now on the floor,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.700]   to your refrigerator, to a camera,
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.700]   to, you know, machines and manufacturing,
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.540]   to retail, et cetera.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.420]   I can give you some examples.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.260]   When we think of something as simple
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260]   as going to the grocery shop,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.220]   we see technology now with something,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.620]   the stuff we've been working with companies like Walmart,
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.520]   electronic shelf labels,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.620]   the ability for you to have smart cameras
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.700]   that can look at shelves
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.780]   and can the camera smart enough to say
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.020]   some product needs to be replenished,
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.220]   ability to see with stress.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.580]   So it's about really providing processor connectivity,
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.300]   artificial intelligence to everything.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.060]   And I think that's one of the largest
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.180]   addressable markets we have for technology
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.340]   because you can't really define everything.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.260]   - Right, exactly.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.180]   It's a nice market 'cause it keeps growing
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.020]   potentially exponentially in speed.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.100]   What about coverage?
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.180]   So how are we doing on the everything part?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.940]   So, you know, there is, like I mentioned,
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.100]   sub six gigahertz 5G and there's millimeter wave 5G.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.780]   So not all 5G is made the same.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.460]   So there's a speed, there's a bandwidth thing.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.780]   And then there's coverage.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.220]   How many people get to enjoy today?
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.100]   And how does the progress in the next five, 10, 20,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.820]   30, 50 years you think it looks like in terms of coverage?
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.060]   - Great topic of conversation.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.140]   So let's talk about this.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.020]   When I meet with regulators across the globe,
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.140]   I tell them resistance is futile.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.980]   I'll locate every spectrum to wireless.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.660]   Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   The reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA,
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.780]   we knew that this industry has done a lot
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.980]   to get more bits per Hertz.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980]   But the reality is the massive amount of improvements
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.100]   that is required in capacity and in speed,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.460]   you need more spectrum.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.300]   You know, there's not so much we can rely
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.460]   on more bits per Hertz.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.020]   You just need more spectrum.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.700]   And if you look, for example,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.180]   what carriers since the 2G era,
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.100]   they participate in different license and auctions
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   and every spectrum they accumulated from 2G or 3G or 4G,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.820]   all of that, you may be able to get one
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.660]   or two channels max of sub-6,
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.660]   which is a channels about 100 megahertz or 200 megahertz.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.700]   And that's it.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   So we need more spectrum.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.300]   So 5G has been designed to work across every spectrum
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.060]   from the low frequency bands,
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.980]   that's what we call the sub-6,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.380]   but you needed more,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.340]   you needed to go to the millimeter wave.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.820]   So that's why 5G is a technology that you can deploy
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.060]   from 450 megahertz as an example,
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   or 600 or 700, all the way to in the 42 gigahertz.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:57.140]   And that's where millimeter wave comes into the picture.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.860]   Now, let's now connect this to your question about coverage.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.540]   A 5G.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.340]   The easiest thing to do is to deploy 5G
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.540]   in the new spectrum you can get,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.420]   which is in the sub-6,
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.860]   you see bands being auctioned across the globe
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.420]   and the 3.5 gigahertz.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.740]   There's nothing special about the band,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.180]   is just the only one that was available
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.540]   because everything else has been used for 4G.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.380]   And you can deploy on that,
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.860]   go into existing cell towers and just put a new equipment
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.380]   without having to build new towers.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.060]   But when we go to technologies,
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.700]   such as millimeter wave,
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.260]   then you have to build more dense networks.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.140]   You need to build more stations
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.700]   because a deployment in that case
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.500]   look like a wifi deployment.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.900]   It's almost like wifi access points.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.980]   When you need to build more stations, you need permits,
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.140]   you need to build fiber.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.580]   So it takes more time to densify.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.260]   So what you see happening is coverage has been built fast
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.660]   with sub-6 across the globe.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.940]   Now the United States also have the sub-6.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   So that gets you to coverage very fast.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.620]   But millimeter wave, it's moving.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.780]   And if you always say, for example, Verizon,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.220]   United States has had a leadership
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.420]   in building millimeter wave.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.260]   It takes time.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260]   I'll say cities like Chicago,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.780]   Manhattan starting to get coverage.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.540]   It will be a process over a number of years
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.220]   as you build those different access point type networks.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.180]   But it's inevitable.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.020]   There's not enough spectrum.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.220]   So every 5G operators, just a matter of time,
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.020]   will have millimeter wave as well.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.740]   - Resistance is futile.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.300]   Okay, so for millimeter wave,
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.140]   we need density of access points.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.140]   And what's the biggest resistance for Qualcomm,
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.660]   for human civilization?
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.500]   Is it politicians, regulators, federal regulators?
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.700]   Is it individual humans?
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.580]   Is it not enough money from the consumer perspective?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.340]   Like who is the biggest pain in the butt?
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.540]   - From a Qualcomm standpoint,
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.420]   but answering the question about
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.420]   what it takes to build all this technology.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.740]   I think regulators across the board
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.660]   understood the importance of 5G.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.940]   I have not met a regulator that said,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.100]   it's really important to be late on 5G.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.340]   I don't think anybody wants to be late on 5G.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.980]   And as a result, we've seen enormous amount of progress
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.300]   in getting spectrum allocated to 5G.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.380]   I think the real issue is the time that it takes
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.660]   to build infrastructure.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.220]   You know, investment in 5G infrastructure,
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.180]   especially millimeter wave,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.060]   is like building roads and ports.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.900]   It's critical infrastructure.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.020]   And those things take time.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.660]   Like one of the number one obstacle
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.020]   you're gonna hear from operators is site permit.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.780]   You know, sometimes they have to negotiate
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.020]   municipality by municipality about permits
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.740]   to get new cell sites.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.220]   But you know, the networks will be densified
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.740]   and you're gonna need all of that capacity
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.100]   for the promise of the fully immersive augmented reality
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.980]   that will replace phones and everything being connected
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.620]   100% of the time.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.980]   - This would not be a conversation with a CEO
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.080]   if I did not ask questions that make you nervous.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.860]   Some people raise concerns
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.420]   about there not being enough studies
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   about the effects of 5G on the human body.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   Is 5G safe?
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.420]   - Look, I have a very simple answer to this question.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:33.860]   As we built new capabilities, such as 5G,
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.020]   power is going down.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.780]   Especially when you think about reducing
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.500]   the number of base stations,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.020]   the network's becoming more dense.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.020]   So as you do that, the power becomes lower.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.620]   If your phone-- - Power radiated from--
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.180]   - Power radiated from the phone
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.020]   and from the tower.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.820]   As you get closer to the tower,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.100]   you don't need that much power to reach the tower.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   So as we move from 4G to 5G,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.580]   I think we see a reduction in the amount of power
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.340]   is required to close the radio link.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.340]   Now, I also have a number of organizations,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.940]   the FCC, for example, has rigorous programs,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.460]   which they do a lot of tests to validate,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.260]   you know, the safety of those devices.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.740]   And I think we have, has been a model for other countries
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.620]   to also to adopt the same things.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.820]   Cellular's been around for a number of decades now.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.380]   I think smartphone is our most beloved device today.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.180]   And I would argue how it's difficult
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.700]   to answer those questions because you,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.620]   but I'll argue that the data to date,
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.700]   have we seen in 3G and 4G, you know,
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   has shown that a lot of the initial concerns
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.020]   were not valid.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.140]   We look at 5G, even though it's new,
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.580]   it's just less power.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.860]   So we look at it from a physics standpoint.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.140]   - So from a physics, from a biology perspective,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.700]   there's a lot of evidence, there's studies
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.180]   that show that it's not dangerous,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.020]   that it is in fact safe.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.620]   However, the concern that people have
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.100]   is when you scale technology exponentially,
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.740]   how will that change human civilization?
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.340]   I mean, that doesn't apply to 5G,
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.980]   that applies to every technology.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.300]   How, you said smartphone is the most beloved device,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.940]   but love sometimes hurts.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.380]   - That's-- - So the impact on society,
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.380]   we don't know.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.700]   And there's a little bit of fear,
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.740]   there's both excitement and fear.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.180]   - It's a great topic of conversation actually.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.140]   So let me give you my perspective on this.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.220]   And you started to see something exactly happening
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.060]   right now.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.740]   So let me step back and let's talk about
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.020]   the fact that we are in a fully interconnected society.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.900]   That when you look of the situations,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.300]   they would talk about smartphones,
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.700]   largest development platform,
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.980]   so much now of our life,
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.500]   we are connected to the smartphone.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.060]   And as a result, and we are all connected
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.580]   and we're connected.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.220]   And then we're building digital twins of everything.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.340]   Right, so when you look at that picture,
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.540]   when you look at the picture,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.900]   this connected society,
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.140]   you started to have the following thoughts,
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.780]   which I think are very healthy,
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.220]   which means in the same way that in the physical world,
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.340]   you're entitled to some rights,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.740]   you have obligations,
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.740]   and there's a lot of things that protect your integrity.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.660]   I think as a rule,
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.580]   we're gonna see the society evolving
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.740]   so those things extend to your digital being
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.340]   of people and things.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.700]   And I think it's just natural.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.140]   It's just natural.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.020]   It's just a natural path.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.540]   And you started to see things like that.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.020]   For example, the Europeans has done a lot in this area.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.940]   I'll say the Europeans probably ahead in the United States
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.940]   thinking about privacy laws, digital privacy laws,
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.820]   most recently the DMA, the Digital Markets Act,
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   which I think is a great thing.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.860]   I think we believe there's incredible thought
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.220]   into enable ability to regulate the digital markets
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.940]   so that there's innovation and competition.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.820]   So not a single company can control all the data
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.580]   and then decide how things are gonna be work
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.940]   on the digital realm.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.020]   And even if we think about the potential things
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.860]   like the metaverses,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.420]   we're connecting physical and digital spaces.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.460]   So I think it's a natural evolution.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.780]   Of course, regulation and laws
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.940]   always follow technology.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.580]   But the fact that we're moving
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.060]   to our interconnected society,
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.380]   there's no going back.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.980]   We are a fully interconnected society.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.140]   But there is opportunity to think about
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.940]   how the digital twin,
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.820]   should people and governments should think about it
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.340]   so that we get the best of a technology
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.260]   without any downside.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.860]   - Yeah, so when you say digital twin,
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.460]   that's one of the other things you're excited about,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.740]   which is the metaverse,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.340]   are basically building worlds in the digital space.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.660]   And you have to start to think about
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   all the basic human rights
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.460]   that transfer from our physical meat vehicles
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.900]   out to the digital copies of ourselves,
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.180]   representations of ourselves.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.700]   It's really important to think about.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.140]   The thing you mentioned about regulators
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.700]   that has been, this is me speaking, frustrating,
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.780]   is like you said, they follow technology.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.900]   So sometimes they don't get the technology at all.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.180]   So they're very clumsy in writing laws
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.720]   that censor that technology in interesting ways.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.320]   They mean good, but they can do a lot of unintended damage.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.460]   Now, both, it's a dance.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.620]   It's a beautiful dance,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.100]   but I just wish governments were better dance partners.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.820]   I just see what they're kind of writing now
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.340]   about regulating social media and platforms like YouTube,
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.420]   and it's just really, really clumsy.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.580]   They don't understand how machine learning works,
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.300]   how recommender systems work.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.940]   And I just wish they kind of caught up a little more
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.860]   because it's really important to be great at regulation,
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.340]   but also it's important to let companies flourish
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.180]   and embrace this new wave of technology.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.380]   That weird dance, I am more and more learning,
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.580]   looking at public policy,
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.580]   how much positive government can do
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.300]   and how much clumsy negative it can do unintentionally,
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.200]   just out of sheer incompetence
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.080]   or lack of curiosity about tech.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.900]   That's my rant about regulators.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.380]   - I think it's a valid point.
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.260]   As I said before, I think the Europeans
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.420]   probably have a very good framework,
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.180]   but the way I'll think about it,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.220]   we depend on have the ability to innovate.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.540]   We depend on the free markets.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   We depend on the ability to create technology
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.260]   that will be disruptive.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.100]   But at the same time, I think the tech companies
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.860]   probably should spend time helping governments
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.940]   understand ahead of time
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.740]   so that they can be better prepared.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.740]   - Let's talk about one of my favorite topics, Snapdragon.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.340]   So Snapdragon is a system on a chip.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.500]   This processor has probably powered billions of smartphones
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.880]   over its pretty long history now,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.060]   a decade and a half maybe.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.260]   So it's constantly iterating.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.060]   There's constantly just like a turmoil
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.620]   of beautiful innovations happening.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.180]   So last year it was Snapdragon 888 was the main one
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.660]   with the five nanometer.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.060]   And this year it's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.640]   It's a new naming scheme.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.740]   Okay, what's the sexiest, most beautiful idea
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.020]   or concept to you about Snapdragon?
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.940]   Let's start there.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.060]   - The way I would describe it,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.300]   and I think the reason we have been successful with it
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.300]   is to really understand how to build a platform,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.500]   a single chip, like a single chip
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.220]   that will have every single capability
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.120]   if you wanna make this smartphone in the palm of your hand,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.500]   something that has all of your computing needs.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.180]   And it was the ability to get,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.300]   from an engineering standpoint,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.100]   ability to get into a single chip
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.260]   of not only all possible connectivity technology
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.660]   from cellular to Wi-Fi to Bluetooth
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.940]   to every single constellation of satellites
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.480]   for position location.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.620]   But at the same time, a very power efficient,
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.540]   single-threaded, multi-threaded CPU.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.420]   A GPU for all of your graphic demands,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   gaming, fastest growing segment for gaming is mobile gaming.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.160]   An artificial intelligence processor,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.100]   which we call the neural processor unit.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.300]   And then a video engine,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.620]   a multimedia engine for every single application,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.740]   audio, everything.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.420]   So it's a single chip
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.340]   that has every single computing technology
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.580]   you need in the phone.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.300]   And what's exciting about it is what we already knew.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   For example, when you think about camera or computer vision,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.700]   you see that advancements in this technology
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.100]   now happens in the smartphone first
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.380]   versus additional cameras.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.420]   So the beauty about the Snapdragon
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.980]   is we always have this thing within Qualcomm.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.220]   The phone, it's small, you have to be able to hold it.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.600]   You're gonna touch your face, so you cannot be hot.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.260]   You have to manage thermals.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.660]   You expect to have a full day of battery life.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.980]   But then you want it to not be sending data
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.900]   into 10 or 100 megabits.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.480]   You want gigabits.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.740]   You want it to be able to have eight core processors.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.400]   You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.280]   You want to have all of those things
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.340]   And to do all of that in your phone
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.980]   and be able to be in the leadership position generation
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.020]   after generation is an incredible thing.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.980]   And we're very proud of that at Qualcomm.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.340]   - Yeah, so you have to do the Wi-Fi, 5G, all of the--
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.860]   - And you have to be good to everyone
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.700]   of those technologies. - All of it.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.300]   And pack it all in.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.740]   And there's also pressure to make the thing
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.660]   faster and faster and faster.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.460]   And then there's more and more applications
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.820]   you're supposed to be effortlessly using.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.540]   And then you mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.420]   They have to also dance together somehow.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.780]   They have to communicate well, share memory or not,
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.380]   depending on what the application is.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.380]   - And your battery has to last all day.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.220]   (laughing)
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060]   - So think about that.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.820]   From a company like Qualcomm, we have to be good
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.740]   in each and every one of those technologies.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.380]   We can't just say, oh, we're a CPU company
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.900]   or a GPU company or we're AI company.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.820]   We have to do everything.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.900]   - What does it take to design a great processor?
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.140]   So design this system on a chip that you mentioned.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.100]   Is there some insight you can provide
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:13.100]   in this chaos of engineers, designers, leaders,
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.780]   the people that think about how much
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.740]   this is all gonna cause, the whole mess of it?
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.700]   - I'm of course very partial about it.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.940]   I've been in this company for probably more than 26 years.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.460]   But I will argue that there are a couple of things
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.820]   that are ingredients for the success.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.660]   So we talk about the fact that we have all those
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.180]   different technologies, they evolve at their own pace
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.820]   and you have to be good in each one of them.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.980]   And you need them to make them working together.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.860]   So you need to have an engineering organization
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.860]   that's with incredible collaboration culture
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.540]   because everybody has to be working.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.220]   The train's gonna leave the station,
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.620]   every cart needs to be there, right?
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.660]   When it leaves the station, it needs to leave on time,
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.220]   especially in the phone business,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.020]   you can't change Christmas, you cannot change Black Friday,
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.420]   you cannot change all of the selling seasons.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.900]   So the phones are gonna launch on time
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.180]   and every technology needs to be there.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.660]   The engineering needs to work as one.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.540]   And we do have that at Qualcomm.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.340]   The other thing, you have to have incredible discipline
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.580]   because those are very complex systems.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.860]   So in one way, you have to design with quality
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.020]   because in many cases, we're gonna be ramping production
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.700]   and even before we have the silicon back
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.340]   and you have to rely on our simulation models
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.340]   and you have to rely on the fact that you design
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.020]   for commercial applications.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.140]   That takes a while to build
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.060]   and it's probably been the history
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.100]   of a semiconductor business at Qualcomm.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.460]   - So you mean like the framework
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.620]   of how many people can use simulation software
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.940]   and all that kind of stuff to build the thing
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.820]   with a hard deadline that you might not even get back
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.740]   from like manufacture before.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.180]   You're not allowed to have any mistakes.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.060]   - No wonder our name is quality communications.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.620]   Oh, I never even thought about the qual part, quality.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.420]   So quality and there's a bar that's high
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.060]   and you're not allowed to mess up.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.020]   I mean, to me as an engineer, that's exciting.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.820]   Hard deadlines, no room for mistakes.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.660]   I love it.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.980]   Super stressful, but I love it.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.980]   So there's a couple of other small companies
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.180]   called Google and Apple.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.460]   So Google is now using its own chip for the Pixel 6.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.540]   Apple using as its own.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.660]   How does Qualcomm out-compete Google and Apple?
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.820]   How does it beat them?
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.500]   - We don't have to out-compete Google.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.260]   Actually, if you look at our mobile strategy today
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.620]   and then one thing I was very clear when I became CEO,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.220]   I think there's all the confusion in the market.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.980]   Our mobile strategy is very clear.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.900]   We are focused of making Snapdragon synonymous
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.740]   with premium Android experience.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.060]   That's what Snapdragon is.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.300]   - Android, the phone of the people.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.140]   - Yes.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.060]   - I just have a love for Android.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.820]   I'm constantly talking trash to iPhone people.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.660]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.540]   - Premium Android experiences.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.580]   So we do produce Snapdragon in multiple tier
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.540]   for every price point, but every year,
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.100]   you mentioned the HN1,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.660]   and every year we'll provide the flagship product
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.940]   and then the other series that is trying to get the best
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.860]   of every possible technology at that time.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.500]   And it's really focused on enabling the Android ecosystem.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.900]   So I'll give an example.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.380]   So you asked me the question, how to compete with Google.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.580]   It's not about competing with Google.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.580]   We're the number one enabler of the Google Android ecosystem.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.660]   And the largest, largest,
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.180]   the number one customer there is actually Samsung.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.700]   And if you look what happened to Samsung,
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.060]   Samsung, I always said,
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.780]   since I began my relationship with them,
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.420]   because they always had their own chip.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.100]   They always had their own chip.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.780]   And if you'll just look at what happened right now
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.900]   with the Galaxy S22 that just launched,
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.580]   they used to balance their business about 50% Qualcomm.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.580]   They will get the most advanced markets
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.980]   like the United States and China and Japan and Korea,
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.700]   they will sign a Qualcomm.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.260]   And then they'll have their own chip for the markets
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.980]   that they would, will be like more emerging markets,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.900]   open markets, markets that they have a control
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.380]   on the channel because they sell a lot of appliances
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.780]   and other things.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.340]   If you look what happened right now, GS22,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.420]   75% is Qualcomm.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.420]   And then the next large OEMs in Android ecosystem
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.860]   are the Chinese ones.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.580]   Companies like Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.260]   It was number one in Europe at some point last year,
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.700]   then followed by OPPO and OnePlus and Vivo.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.620]   So those are some of the largest Qualcomm customers.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   And they actually drive the Android ecosystem.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.180]   And that's our mobile strategy
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.700]   and fully aligned with Google and it's working.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.340]   And I was, you know, not to get into a lot
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.700]   of the investor conversation, but we're also happy.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.700]   We became a beneficiary of the shifts that we saw
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.900]   in the marketplace.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   Huawei became a smaller OEM as a result of the sanctions.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.980]   We saw the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from China,
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.980]   especially for China domestic market, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.780]   They moved to the premium category
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.420]   and they're all doing that with Qualcomm.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.900]   So we're actually very fortunate and happy
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.580]   with the position we are in mobile business.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.500]   We do have an Apple relationship.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.820]   We provide modem technology to Apple.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.700]   It's a multi-year relationship.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.140]   Apple has been very public that they are investing
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.420]   to develop their own modem,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.500]   but the Qualcomm strategy has been clear.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.340]   We're really focused on Snapdragon.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.420]   Our mobile strategy is not defined
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.820]   by providing a cellular modem to Apple.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.100]   Our mobile strategy is this that we just talked about it.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.180]   It's about the unique thing of Snapdragon
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.900]   that has every single technology integrated
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.660]   into a single SoC.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.100]   And that's-- - It provides
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.380]   a premium experience. - And that's what we're doing
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.940]   and focusing on the Android ecosystem.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.700]   - I don't know if I can ask you this kind of question.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.940]   It's like picking your-- - Go ahead.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.220]   - Children or something like this,
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.620]   but what smartphone with a Snapdragon,
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.220]   you mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.500]   those are phones I personally really enjoy.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.340]   What phone do you currently use?
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.700]   Or do you have multiple phones and you just--
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.700]   - I do have multiple phones, but I do use Galaxy S22.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.020]   - That's your favorite one?
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.460]   All right, well, you heard it here first, folks.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.860]   Okay, so excellent.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   Can Qualcomm also, let's take a brief step away from mobile
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.540]   and take on Intel and Apple and other such companies
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.220]   in the laptop and desktop space?
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.700]   So the nature of what a computer is seems to be changing.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.340]   It's like smartphones merging.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.820]   It's all being a smartphone just with the biggest screen
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.660]   or something like this.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.780]   So what does the future of that look like?
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.460]   - Before I answer that question,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.460]   let me just step back a little bit,
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.620]   because, and I'm sure we can talk more about those things,
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.940]   but the reality is Qualcomm is changing a lot.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.140]   And we use, I know we spend a lot of time
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.780]   talking about 5G and smartphone and Snapdragon.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.500]   And I think that has been what had defined Qualcomm
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.740]   for many years, but the reality is even consistent
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.580]   with that 5G conversation,
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.820]   which is a technology to connect everything,
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.420]   Qualcomm is also changing.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.860]   Our technology that was in many cases designed for phones,
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.900]   and we said it at the beginning,
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.420]   connectivity and processing,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.900]   is going to virtually every industry.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.060]   And as a result, Qualcomm is really changing with it
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.780]   and expanding to a number of different addressable markets.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.780]   Some of those markets is the PC, as you talk about it.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.620]   The conversions of mobile and PC.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.020]   And the reason I'm excited about this,
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.900]   because you see a lot of things happening
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.700]   that bring this right front and center
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.420]   when you think about the future of technology.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.580]   So what we learn with the pandemic
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.060]   is that the number one use case
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.760]   of personal computers is communications.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.460]   It is interesting when you think about that,
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.380]   that's the number one use case on a PC today
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.700]   is communications.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.580]   It's actually funny because in the cellular industry,
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.260]   actually I'll say, let me step back.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.580]   In the telecom industry,
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.900]   we've been chasing this killer application
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.740]   of video telephony for decades, right?
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.060]   I remember back then in the wireline,
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.420]   even before the internet and IP, ISDN,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.500]   you remember those AT&T desk phones of a little screen,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.220]   and they said, "You can do video telephony."
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.340]   We don't watch that in Back to the Future 2.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.500]   Then when we started developing 3G,
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.900]   people said, "What's the application
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.620]   for having data to cell phone, all video telephony?"
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.380]   Then we started doing 4G,
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.060]   and in the beginning people said,
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.700]   "Well, why do you need all this broadband,
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.460]   all video telephony?"
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.140]   But it took a pandemic to make video telephony
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.620]   the killer application.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.900]   And that's now the number one use case on a PC.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.020]   So now think about that for a second.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.620]   Be personal computers now,
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.860]   there are technologies that people,
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.940]   when they were gonna buy a PC,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.740]   they didn't care much about it, now they do.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.820]   Camera, camera, how good is the camera?
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.940]   The audio, is that connected?
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.940]   How good is the connectivity?
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.020]   Do you have the latest and greatest Wi-Fi and cellular?
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.420]   What's the battery life?
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.980]   Because you're gonna be working from anywhere.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.300]   Sometimes you're near death, sometimes you're not.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.780]   So all those things, what's the portability like?
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.820]   So those things started to change
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.420]   how we should think about the PC, but I won't stop there.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.100]   Let me talk about another trend.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.860]   So, and all come as a result of what we saw the pandemic.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.100]   Let's say that you are an engineer,
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.780]   you do computer aided design.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.380]   You have an advanced desktop computer
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.140]   or workstation in your office,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.180]   but you wanna work from home someday.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.300]   So you're not gonna move that to your home.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.140]   So what do you need to do?
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.300]   You're gonna have to rely on that,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.860]   you're gonna run that on the cloud.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.140]   And you're gonna run it on the cloud,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.820]   you need high bandwidth,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.700]   because you almost want the cloud
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.340]   to be the same as your computer for that use case.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.580]   That's the 5G on demand computing use case.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.180]   The use 5G is almost a link between two computers.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.620]   But then, CIOs are saying,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.300]   well, my workforce is going home for certain days,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.540]   I want all the data to be in the cloud.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.020]   You look at, for example, Microsoft OneDrive
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.300]   or the ability to collaborate, you need the bandwidth.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.820]   So when you put all of those things together,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.220]   you start thinking about what is the next generation PC?
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.060]   And that's the opportunity for Qualcomm.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.100]   I'll just give an example.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:26.100]   Back in Mobile World Congress recently, Lenovo,
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.860]   they have a line of enterprise laptops called the ThinkPad.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.020]   I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.220]   So they announced the ThinkPad based on Snapdragon.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.940]   With 5G on, 28 hours of battery life.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.740]   So that's next generation PC.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.580]   - So just a nice screen with extremely high,
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.740]   nice screen and keyboard,
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.300]   and extremely high connectivity
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.660]   to maybe an even more powerful machine in the cloud.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.900]   Something more of the data, connecting to the data,
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.540]   connecting to compute, all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.500]   - You have the camera capabilities.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.180]   And let me go one step more.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.660]   Microsoft talking about some of the features
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.660]   they're doing now using on Windows 11, using Snapdragon.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   Remember, we talk about it,
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.540]   Snapdragon has an AI processor inside there.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.060]   So one of the cool features Microsoft's talking about it is,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.060]   you can be on a team's call,
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.820]   and you can make sure your eyes are looking at the camera
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.700]   a percent of the time.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.140]   - Well, that's an interesting,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.980]   so they can be talking about that.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.300]   - And you do that with AI.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.140]   - Yes, that's really tricky to pull off.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.020]   For example, the reason I'm a huge stickler
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.580]   for doing these in person, these conversations in person,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.900]   it's really tough to get right, but it's a worthy challenge.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.780]   So that's where the metaverse hopes to,
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.860]   so like, I just, 'cause you said the importance
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.260]   of this telephony, of humans connecting,
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.900]   teleporting themselves,
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.900]   getting that right is really difficult.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.060]   There's a lot of people hate Zoom meetings,
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.420]   but that doesn't mean you can't improve that experience
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.180]   and get rid of the hate.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.060]   A lot of people hate talking to their car too,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.020]   because the voice, the natural language processing
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.860]   is terrible, but when it's not, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.100]   So getting that right is--
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.340]   - This is an opportunity, this is an opportunity.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.500]   Think about it, it starts with the PC,
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.300]   making the PC giving you a better experience for Teams,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.180]   but then it goes right back into this trend
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.500]   of connecting physical and digital spaces,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.180]   and all the work we're doing with the metaverse
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.260]   and virtual reality, and meta-reality in the future
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.620]   is why not call somebody or connect with somebody
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.380]   with a hologram, it's possible.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.820]   - And also to mention some increasing amount
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.060]   of intelligence in our cars.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.060]   So semi-autonomous, autonomous cars,
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.820]   and the interactivity between human and car,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.900]   which for me, things are really exciting.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.100]   Let me ask you a big question.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   So when aliens again, now on the other side,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.940]   right, and humans destroy themselves
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.780]   through nuclear war centuries from now--
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.300]   - Let's hope not. - Let's hope not.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.180]   But in case, you know, let's just hypothetical,
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.220]   thought experiment, and they write a history
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.380]   of humanity in the 21st century,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.540]   what would they remember Qualcomm in the 21st century
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.380]   as a company?
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.100]   Would it be a car company?
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.020]   Like think of all the crazy pivots
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.940]   that might happen in the next like 50 years.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.820]   'Cause you're thinking, you said Qualcomm enables
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.420]   all of these things, with 5G,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.900]   and there'll be probably other Gs, it keeps increasing.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.620]   So basically connectivity and computation,
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.140]   and everything becomes connected,
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.700]   and everything is capable of computation.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.880]   Might you become a robotics and car company?
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.060]   - I will argue we're already an automotive company today,
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.780]   and, but let me tell what I would like Qualcomm
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.040]   to be remembered and recognized for.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   I think everyone that knows Qualcomm immediately,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.900]   you know, connect us, pun intended,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.020]   to connectivity and wireless.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.300]   But the reality is we're being actually
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.980]   the company providing intelligence and processing
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.580]   to everything on the edge,
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.900]   everything outside the data center that we're doing.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.780]   Those billions of devices, they're gonna be connected.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.740]   And that's kind of explained when we talk about
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.460]   the connected intelligent edge,
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.940]   the beyond phones, cars, PCs, and all of those,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.460]   and the broader IOTOs, we talk about everything
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.020]   will be connected and intelligent.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.820]   And that's what we want Qualcomm to be recognized for.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.060]   - So by the way, for people who are not familiar,
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.820]   there's some technical jargon,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.460]   but people use the word edge, like edge computing.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.700]   It's, by the way, that's probably changing
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.000]   what that even means, but it's basically everything
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.980]   that's not a giant thing that's make a lot of noise
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.220]   in a building somewhere.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.900]   So it's mobile devices and the mobile devices
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.380]   of all kinds, well, a refrigerator is not mobile,
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.660]   but it would be edge.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.700]   So it's like, what's a sandwich, that kind of discussion.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:53.140]   But basically edge computing is the edge
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.260]   of that expanding space that you mentioned
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.220]   that Qualcomm is trying to connect
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.660]   and enable with computation.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.940]   - Hugest input to describe what the edge is
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.500]   and edge computing is.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.460]   I think as we think about the evolution of the data center,
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.380]   you need to bring the computational closer
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.020]   to where the device is.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.960]   Also, when you put the computation together
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.680]   with the connectivity at the same time,
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.940]   you're gonna see a lot of advancement
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.100]   of artificial intelligence happening closer
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.740]   or at the device.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.460]   Look, it's a very, I have a simple way to describe it.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.900]   Remember in the beginning of this conversation,
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.660]   we talk about in the 4G era,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.900]   broadband and mobile computing evolved side by side.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.980]   If you're gonna have broadband,
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.900]   you might as well have a computer in the palm of your hand.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.140]   So we needed to invest in those two technologies.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.820]   In 5G, AI develops side by side.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.460]   You're connected to the cloud 100% of the time.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.380]   You have a high bandwidth and you have now
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.860]   a smart and intelligent thing
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.140]   that can make decision in real time,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.700]   provide context information to the cloud
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.420]   to make the models more accurate
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.180]   and as well compare and contrast with the cloud.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.500]   So there's gonna be an exponential development AI
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.820]   happening with all the edge devices.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.220]   The devices that are outside the data center
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.860]   and computation is gonna go alongside that.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.580]   And a great example of that is the car.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.860]   The car, we haven't talked much about the car,
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.900]   but Qualcomm is now, you could argue,
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.700]   was as much as an automotive company
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.940]   as a wireless company working 26 global brands.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.380]   And it's easy to see, if you look at our mobile heritage
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.860]   and we talk about form factors, thermal, battery life,
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.380]   you're not gonna put a server in the trunk of a car,
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.740]   but you need as much computational capabilities.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.740]   And that's what we see Qualcomm providing,
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.060]   as the car become a connected computer on wheels,
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.060]   we provide the computational and all the sensors
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.660]   for you to do assistive driving
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.780]   for the new digital cockpit experience,
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.540]   connecting the car to the cloud.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.940]   And it's all of that's happening at the end.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.900]   - Does Qualcomm want to be the brain
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.780]   of a lot of autonomous vehicles in the future
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.460]   of different, you said brands, like Mercedes,
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   BMW, I don't know, whatever, just whatever car,
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.740]   cars have the sexy thing they do
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.500]   and then it defines their brand and so on.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.820]   And then there's the brain
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.460]   that doesn't need to have branding, suppose.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.860]   So does Qualcomm see that
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.460]   or will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car?
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.300]   Like literally it'll be Qualcomm.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   - No, you're not gonna be able to buy a Qualcomm car,
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   but we're ready on our way to become the brains of the car.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.740]   The way you should think
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.460]   about Qualcomm automotive strategy is,
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.140]   the car companies realize
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.140]   they need to become technology companies.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:47.140]   You just look, for example, of the market cap
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.780]   of some of the new electrical comers
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.700]   and compare them with the legacy car companies.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.540]   - Which one is that?
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.140]   I heard of, is it--
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:58.980]   - Well, let's just use an example.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.660]   - One of them lives in Austin.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.220]   - Let's say Rivian, right?
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.060]   Rivian.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.900]   - Oh, that one too, yes.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.700]   - You know, the car companies are not going away.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.660]   It's actually a mistake not to bet in the car companies.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   The car companies need a technology partner
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.700]   that will provide the digital chassis for them
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.140]   and that's what we're doing.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.260]   So if you look at Qualcomm,
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.340]   we talk about a Snapdragon digital chassis.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.340]   So we want to be the preferred technology partner
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.700]   of the car companies and I think it's working.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.020]   Strategy is working right now.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.700]   - So basically helping the car companies
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   accelerate into becoming technology companies.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.380]   - Connecting the car to the cloud,
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.900]   redesign the interior of the digital cockpit experience
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.540]   and provide the computation and sensor capabilities
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.380]   for autonomy and assisted driving.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.620]   - On the topic of robots,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.340]   when millions or billions of robots
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   roam the earth in the future among us humans,
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:59.340]   and I am, for one, concerned in a small percentage,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.200]   but largely I'm excited about that future,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   will Qualcomm be the thing that powers their brain?
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.820]   - We have in our IoT business,
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.860]   which has been one of the fastest growing business for us,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   a number of robotics engagement.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.980]   So I'll give you some example.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.180]   If you look of the Amazon Astro,
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.220]   you familiar with that?
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.820]   There's two Snapdragon in there.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.700]   - There is?
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.520]   This is really exciting.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.460]   They're supposed to ship it to me.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.340]   Where is it?
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.860]   Okay, but anyway, that's really cool.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.100]   I didn't know it was Snapdragons.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.720]   - Yeah, we're working with robotics in industrial,
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.300]   of course drones.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.900]   We're getting more and more traction for robotics.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.740]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.300]   Industrial robotics too, you said?
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.380]   - Industrial, especially when you think about
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:55.780]   what's gonna happen with the factory of the future,
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.060]   the industrial side of the future,
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.200]   the warehouse of the future,
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.540]   when you bring 5G, for example, to it,
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.540]   and you have a number of different use cases,
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.140]   and then you see a lot of robotics application.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.820]   And of course drones.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.500]   And the most famous, I will consider that a robot,
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.960]   the most famous robot in the world right now,
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.300]   it's powered by a Snapdragon,
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.500]   which is the Mars Ingenuity Helicopter.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.380]   The whole helicopter, the cameras and everything,
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.780]   is powered by a Snapdragon.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.780]   And talking about exciting thing for an engineer,
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.140]   the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone,
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.220]   and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example,
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.900]   Samsung, the same, not a special one,
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.360]   went all the way to Mars.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.020]   - Is exploring other planets, looking for alien life,
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.120]   and maybe gets to meet 'em.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.100]   Wouldn't that be interesting,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.740]   if a Snapdragon is the thing that first sees an alien?
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.640]   It's like, what the hell?
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.340]   We did not program this in the computer vision.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.980]   - I want to use the example to go back
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.140]   to the conversation we had about quality.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.580]   As an engineer, you need to make sure it works.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.260]   Can you imagine if it gets over there on Mars
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.100]   and it doesn't work?
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.060]   - Listen, this is very stressful.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.020]   What NASA, what SpaceX, what all those companies are doing
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.100]   is extremely stressful.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.580]   The room for mistakes is tiny.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.280]   But that's super exciting for an engineer, once again.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.340]   There's been a global semiconductor chip shortage.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.720]   So from your perspective, just it'd be interesting
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.380]   to get your expert analysis of the situation.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.780]   What do you think are the main reasons,
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.580]   and how is Qualcomm being affected, and how can it help?
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.380]   In this, in the future, things like it.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   - Okay, that's a big topic of conversation.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.060]   And we only have five minutes.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.900]   - So I'll try to be as objective as I can.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.780]   So first, let's talk about what caused it.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.460]   And you hear a lot of different things.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.840]   I will try to put it within the right context.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.320]   The first thing that caused it, really,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.900]   is the acceleration of digital transformation
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:59.180]   of pretty much everything in every industry.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.380]   Every industry's been digitally transformed.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.940]   And as such, the amount of semiconductors
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.420]   that are required is much larger.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.020]   Just to give you a practical example,
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.660]   if you think about the automotive as an example,
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.100]   the cars that are, there's cars that are launch,
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.180]   a new model launching today.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.700]   The new model launching today most likely has 10x
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.940]   the amount of chips of the prior model.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.620]   And the amount of people working on this coming in next,
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.460]   probably 10x that one.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.140]   So you see the amount of silicon,
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.580]   and then billions of things become smart.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.420]   More and more data goes to the cloud.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.820]   The data center grows.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:40.500]   So the floor for semiconductor consumptions went up by a lot.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.180]   Then you have things that aggravated this.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   The pandemic aggravated this.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.820]   There is a couple of trends from the pandemic.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.100]   The enterprise transformation of the home.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.540]   The home became an enterprise,
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   massive amounts of upgrades on broadband and IoT.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:02.540]   The office has changed to the way we work now,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.300]   including the ability to support collaboration tools
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.820]   and video.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.820]   Then you have the higher demand for products
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.700]   during the pandemic because people wanted to be connected.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.340]   People bought new phones and new tablets
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   and new computers, new gaming.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.820]   So all of those things came on top of that
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.580]   as the aggravated issue, but they're not the main issue.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   The main issue is it's actually a long-term growth
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.180]   of digital.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.340]   - So what I'm hearing you say is the pandemic
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.500]   was not the cause.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.780]   It was an aggravation.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.620]   - It was an aggravation.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.620]   - So is there a way we can support as a human civilization
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:51.380]   in terms of manufacture, in terms of supply,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.860]   the kind of growth that you're talking about
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.620]   in devices and so on?
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.060]   Is there high-level ideas you can say
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.940]   of what that's required there?
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.500]   - Yes, and I think that's the second part of the answer.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.860]   So what's happening now?
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.540]   How are we gonna get out of this?
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:10.140]   So we see a lot of capacity investments
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.860]   put into place by the industry.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.700]   We had invested a lot of our suppliers.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.500]   A lot of the suppliers had made plans
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.100]   about increasing the capacity.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.380]   The industry is planning to double
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.180]   its total semiconductor manufacturing capacity
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.140]   within the next five years, an example.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.460]   So that's already happening.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.900]   And then you see things which are actually good.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.300]   They're good.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.100]   The initiative such as the United States CHIPS Act,
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.620]   and now the European CHIPS Act.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.740]   The United States CHIPS Act's about $52 billion.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.900]   The Europeans about 43.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   Their goal combined is to get at least 50%
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.340]   of the consumption with manufacturing installed
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.980]   within the US and European geographies.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.260]   And that's also very good.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.100]   That's yet another incentive
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.900]   for more manufacturing capacity to be built
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.220]   and to be built with a geographic distributed way,
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.860]   which that's how you plan supply chain.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.340]   So those I think are good things.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.940]   So if anything we learn through the crisis
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.380]   is that semiconductor is important.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.260]   Semiconductor companies are important
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.780]   and we need to invest in semiconductors.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.060]   - Returning to the grilling of the CEO
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.100]   with the hard questions.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.540]   This is almost from my own education of the space.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.140]   You mentioned regulators.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.260]   Qualcomm paid out and received payment
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.980]   of billions of dollars in settlement and fines.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.580]   There seems to be a lot of huge lawsuits in this space.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.220]   How do you explain that?
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.820]   Does this get in the way of innovation or does it promote it?
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.420]   - I will rephrase it by saying there used to be
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.880]   a lot of lawsuits in this space.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.260]   In addition of what we do in semiconductors,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.020]   our processors and our modems, the Snapdragon platform,
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:04.660]   we also have a licensing business,
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.100]   which has been a part of the company since the beginning.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:13.100]   As the largest inventors of the essential technology
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:18.380]   in 2G, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 5G,
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.820]   and Qualcomm contribute that to the standards.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.380]   So we always had this model that rather than
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.020]   invent the technology and be the only one
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.740]   producing the products, we license
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.860]   so everyone can produce it.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.060]   And as such, we receive intellectual property
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.380]   for the standard essential patents.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:44.460]   As part of our past dispute with Apple,
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.220]   that's behind us now.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.300]   - You're friends now.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.220]   - They're my customers.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.580]   - And as part of that, I think the licensing model
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.580]   got tested in, I think, in every geography.
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.100]   And we succeeded in every single geography
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.780]   to validate the pro-competitiveness of this model.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.540]   I think the fair, reasonable,
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.260]   non-discriminatory aspect of this model.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.900]   And I would argue that besides being
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.420]   the most successful licensing business to date
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.140]   in the industry, probably the one that's been
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.340]   battle-tested and is most stable
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.860]   because there's not a single jurisdiction
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.060]   that we have not had to validate that model.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.180]   So it's part of our past, and what it creates
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.220]   is probably create a lot of stability
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.240]   in our licensing business.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.300]   But having said that, the growth of the company
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.260]   is in the semiconductor space.
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.300]   - And the semiconductor, so licensing is,
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.860]   you come up with a pretty good idea,
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.140]   you have a bunch of smart people coming up with cool ideas,
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.940]   and then once you come up with that idea,
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.380]   you sell that idea to others that get to use it.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.940]   That's essentially what a license--
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:58.100]   - The license revenue we have is for the,
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:02.180]   what we call the SCP, Standard Essential Patents,
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:07.180]   that are part of the 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G standards.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.860]   So if you want to build anything with 5G,
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.500]   you need to get a license from Qualcomm
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.900]   because it uses Qualcomm essential technologies
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.940]   as part of the standard.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.580]   And a slightly different model,
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.100]   or a lot different model with the semiconductor
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.820]   is you design, you inject a bunch of fascinating ideas,
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.020]   how to build the Snapdragon,
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.820]   and then there's, because it's a fabulous company,
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.580]   you have somebody build the chip,
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.460]   and then it goes into a phone with the branding
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.100]   And that has less kind of players involved,
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:40.940]   it's not a license.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.300]   - We sell the product in the,
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.420]   we don't license semiconductor technology,
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.620]   we build products and we sell products.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.620]   - This is your first year as a CEO.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.940]   - No, not one year yet.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.060]   - Not one year yet.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:58.300]   Let's hope, it'll be in June, it'll be one year.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   Okay, this is a company that's involved
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.220]   with a lot of fascinating technologies
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.540]   and it's touching the lives of billions of people.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.220]   A lot of complicated stuff,
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.460]   like you said, licensing technologies,
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:17.420]   you have to collaborate with manufacturers,
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.660]   you have to then work with however many,
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:23.460]   you said, car companies and all these clients and so on,
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:28.460]   and you have to, with tech companies, Apple and so on.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.460]   What's that like?
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.060]   What lessons have you learned about leadership
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.100]   and maybe about yourself as a human being
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.300]   from this first, almost a year,
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.380]   soon to be a year as a CEO of this incredible,
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.140]   this complex, this large company?
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.580]   - That's a loaded question.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.060]   Let me answer in reverse order.
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.540]   First thing that I learned,
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.540]   and I think it's probably common across CEOs,
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.820]   especially in our industry is,
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.300]   it will be great if I had more time.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.940]   I think there's, especially because we grow
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.260]   in so many areas and there's so many things to learn,
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.620]   so many relationships to build,
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.340]   time to spend with a number of different technologies,
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.140]   but it kind of reflects really the size
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.220]   of the opportunity that exists for Qualcomm.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.900]   Qualcomm, it is really growing
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.100]   in a number of different directions all at the same time.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.900]   And so it did got busier,
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.860]   and part of this is because I'm spending a lot of time
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.780]   understanding the new industries we're going in
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.660]   and building relationships.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.420]   Second thing, which is a lot to do
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.380]   with how I think about things
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.620]   and a little bit of my personality.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.380]   At the end of the day,
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.980]   business partnerships really done by people.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:51.420]   And I think the importance of having trusted relationships
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.900]   for the long-term is extremely important.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.420]   And I've been dedicated to do that as CEO.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:01.900]   We're not a company that plays for the short-term, we don't.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.820]   And when we build new partnerships,
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.020]   we expect that to be for decades.
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.460]   And so I spend time doing that
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.300]   and I think that's important for Qualcomm.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.100]   The other part of your question is,
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.940]   we do have a lot of opportunities in all those different areas.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.580]   What we like, and I've been fortunate enough
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.820]   to become CEO at a time,
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.180]   that a lot of the trends are pointing toward technology.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.220]   We talk about some of them.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.300]   We talk about merger of physical and digital spaces.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.500]   We talk about the transformation of the automobile.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   We talk about the merge of computing and mobile,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.580]   the enterprise transformation of the home.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.420]   There are many of those trends.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:46.180]   And those trends create opportunities for Qualcomm
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.820]   to be providing technology first.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.660]   And as such, we're in a hurry.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.420]   So I'm in a little bit of a hurry
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.700]   because I think the opportunity is incredible
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:02.620]   for technology, but having fun and enjoying the job.
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.740]   - Is there a burden because of so much
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.780]   what you said is partnerships and,
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   almost like friendships,
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.260]   connections with other human beings.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.580]   Me as an introvert that has a lot of social anxiety,
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:17.140]   that seems extremely stressful.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.300]   So is there that burden on your shoulders?
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.140]   You have to wake up every day
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:25.900]   and talk to friends you've had for many years.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.620]   It can be, you know, and then convince them
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.120]   and make partnerships with them, talk with them,
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.860]   describe to them the future, sell them an idea,
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   and then yourself grow because you don't know
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.460]   what the heck the future is gonna be like.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.940]   And you have to project both confidence and humility,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.180]   all those kinds of things.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   Is that exhausting?
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:48.620]   - It is exhausting, but it's something I do like to do.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.220]   And it's not only with partners,
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.940]   really it's also internally to your employees.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.380]   So I think to get alignment on the vision
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.620]   and faith in the vision and execute.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.060]   And at the end of the day, we're very fortunate.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.140]   We have a lot of smart people.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.060]   So people, if they're aligned with the vision,
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.380]   they know what to do.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.260]   And then of course, as CEO,
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.780]   you have to convince your investors
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.900]   that that's the right idea as well.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.940]   - If you can put on your wise sage hat,
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.060]   do you have advice for young people
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.700]   in high school and college?
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.280]   You, yourself, started from the humble beginnings in Brazil,
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:28.860]   maybe a bit of a wild, risky decision to go to Japan,
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.820]   and now are at the head of one of the biggest,
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:34.100]   most successful, most impactful companies in the world.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.980]   Given that story, can you give advice to young people today
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.180]   that they can have a career
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.080]   or just the life they can be proud of?
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.420]   - I think the first thing,
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.300]   and of course all of those answers are gonna relate
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:52.140]   to my own experience, right?
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:57.140]   The first thing is, it always worked for me to have a plan.
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.820]   Even if the plan is just what I'm gonna do
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.260]   in the next two years, but what do I want to do?
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.980]   Where do I wanna go?
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.500]   And I think it's important for people,
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.800]   especially young people,
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:15.140]   is to really have a dream and go pursue it.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.580]   I mean, have dreams, not go back to bed to sleep.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.740]   It's really what do you want to accomplish
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.340]   and then what it's gonna take to do that.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.220]   And then believe in yourself.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.500]   Like I said, I joined Qualcomm as an engineer.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.180]   And I didn't have any plans when I joined to be CEO,
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.820]   but I do want to, as an engineer, what do I want to do?
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.300]   Where do I wanna contribute?
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.380]   What do I wanna work on?
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.860]   And then keep evolving from that point in time.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.260]   The other thing is, this isn't advice,
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.500]   it's more of like career advice
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   that I got early in my career was extremely helpful for me.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.060]   And I will give that advice to everyone that is interested.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.580]   Spend time understanding what are the things you're good at
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.300]   and what are the things you're not?
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.620]   Like what is that real border between your area
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.620]   of competence and your area of incompetence?
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.260]   And once you see that, once you see that,
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.740]   you know exactly what you have to work on
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.920]   and you can say, if that's what I wanna go next,
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.180]   this is the gap I need to do it.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.780]   And it's faster when you can identify yourself
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.260]   before other people can tell you.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.460]   Then it leads to automatically the next step.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.100]   Surround yourself, the people that are very good
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.500]   at the things that you're not.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.780]   - So you have to be radically honest
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.140]   about the things that you're not good at,
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.980]   but given what you're passionate about,
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.700]   you need to get good at, or you would like to get good at
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.660]   and surround yourself by those people.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.620]   How often did the plans you make actually work out?
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.460]   So you said it's important to make plans.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.100]   You didn't say anything about it's important
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.940]   to execute on those plans.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.580]   - More than 50% success rate.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.900]   - Try to keep it above 50.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.820]   - Try to keep it above 50.
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.140]   - What was the whole, why did you end up in Japan?
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.900]   - You know, I've been fortunate enough
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.700]   to work in cellular and wireless my entire career.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.820]   So I always liked communications.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.640]   When I entered engineering school,
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.260]   my dad was an electrical engineer,
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.080]   but he worked with the utility company.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.020]   He wanted me to graduate in traditional electrical engineering
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.000]   like energy generation, distribution,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.480]   but I like electronics communication,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.680]   so I ended up doing both.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.260]   And I always liked communication,
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.140]   was fascinated by wireless communication.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.620]   So my first job out of college,
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.940]   I started working for a Japanese company down in Brazil.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.220]   It was NEC, and within about a year in,
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.580]   they transferred me to Tokyo,
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.020]   asked me to go to their headquarters,
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.100]   and it was the first time I left Brazil.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.420]   - A little bit different from Brazil, culturally.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.940]   - Very different.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.140]   It's in the other side of the planet,
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.540]   and that's how it started.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.940]   - You said your father's an electrical engineer.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.580]   Do you think what you're doing now makes your father proud?
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.660]   - I think he's very proud.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.420]   I think especially, you know,
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.580]   he tells me that, you know,
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.620]   I'm still the same person, never change.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.220]   - Does he give you advice?
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.780]   Does he criticize what you're doing?
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.380]   Tell you how to improve?
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.100]   - My mom and dad still give me advice today.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.500]   I'm very fortunate for that.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.260]   But he's proud, also proud,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.260]   because there are very few Brazilians
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.380]   that have achieved a position as CEO
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.420]   of a company the size of Qualcomm.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.280]   And I do know that also I carry a burden,
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.740]   especially for the Latino community,
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.220]   to be an inspiration for them
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.980]   and make sure I set a good example.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.380]   - So not just your mom and dad,
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:59.380]   but the culture, the people that were originally your home.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.840]   Do you, you know, life is finite.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.700]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.940]   - Look, I'm a devout Christian,
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:14.600]   and so I'm a big believer that there's,
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.900]   this is just a transition.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.320]   But don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.800]   I am somebody good, better, and different
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.360]   that try as much as possible to leave the present,
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.400]   and that's what I do.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.000]   - And try to make the present better on this place here.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.520]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.040]   - And that some of these technologies,
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.200]   some of these ideas are kind of,
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.520]   a different kind of immortality as well,
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.480]   'cause they propagate through time
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.680]   and have impact on people in the best possible way.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.880]   So technology can be scary,
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.280]   technology can be destructive,
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.600]   but it seems like in the end,
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.480]   it can be, it can do a lot of good.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.280]   - More good, there's more good than bad.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.120]   - What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.600]   I asked you about aliens observing us.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.620]   What's the meaning of life?
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.640]   Cristiano, what's the meaning of life?
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.920]   Easy questions.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.120]   - That's not an easy question at all.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.760]   I think that's a question, at least for me,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.620]   you have to answer individually.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.840]   But I do believe we're all here for a purpose.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.920]   In my prayers, I always ask that I stay on track
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.960]   to whatever my purpose is,
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.160]   but I do believe we're here for a purpose
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.840]   and we need to do the best we can
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.920]   during the time we have on this Earth.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.040]   - So that means create beautiful things for you
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.600]   as an engineer? - Do the right thing, yes,
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.640]   and create beautiful things, yes.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.280]   - What about love?
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.780]   What's the role of love in the human condition?
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.960]   - Love's very important,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.760]   and it's an essential part of being human.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.880]   It comes in the package.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.100]   And I think if you look at the situation,
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.480]   what's happening right now,
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.720]   I think you look at the situation
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.320]   with some of the underprivileged communities,
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.200]   you look at the homeless situation,
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.240]   I think we all need more love.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.720]   Yeah, and I think people that build incredible technology
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.640]   sometimes forget the love part.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.320]   Like, those are all, it's all integrated.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.760]   There's no, thinking about humanity is really important
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.020]   when you build tools that empower that humanity.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.400]   'Cause there's, I think, at least I personally believe
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.240]   we're all capable of both evil and good.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.440]   And we have to build technology, build societies,
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.240]   build governments, build communities
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.040]   that inspire us to connect with the good part
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.000]   within all of us.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.840]   - I'm a big believer that technology is, at the end,
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.760]   the force for good.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.600]   And if you just look, you know,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.920]   not trying to move away from a deep discussion
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.200]   to a more specific, technical one,
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.680]   but if we start a conversation talking about smartphones,
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.280]   and smartphones, really, the first time
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   that you could say that everybody in the world
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.000]   was able to connect to the internet
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:07.920]   and connect to each other.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.400]   And I think what, that empowerment that that provided,
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.280]   it's an incredible force for good.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:18.680]   - Well, the company you lead, the technology you've created,
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.160]   one of them that I'm especially excited about,
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.880]   which is Snapdragon, the whole line of processors there.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.640]   Currently, I would say at about 10 billion transistors.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.240]   If you think about the human brain,
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.600]   it's about 100 billion neurons.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.480]   So I think 11 Samsung Galaxy S22s
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.760]   are already smarter than me.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.080]   And that's being nice to me.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.280]   I'm really honored that you spent
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.720]   your extremely valuable time with me.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.080]   Even though you said Pele is the favorite player,
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.360]   beyond all of that, I think you're an incredible person,
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.240]   an incredible leader, and you lead
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.880]   an incredible engineering company.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.000]   So thank you for doing that.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.840]   - Oh, thank you so much.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.040]   Thank you for the kind words.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.920]   Really a pleasure having this conversation.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.360]   I really had a lot of fun doing it.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.920]   And thank you for having me on your podcast.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.320]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.000]   with Cristiano Amon.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.200]   To support this podcast,

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.960]   And now let me leave you with some words
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.920]   from Stephen Hawking.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.560]   "For millions of years,
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.400]   "mankind lived just like the animals.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.800]   "Then something happened,
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.720]   "which unleashed the power of our imagination.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.080]   "We learned to talk and we learned to listen.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.320]   "Speech has allowed the communication of ideas,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.400]   "enabling human beings to work together
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.360]   "to build the impossible.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.600]   "Mankind's greatest achievements
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.040]   "have come about by talking,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.120]   "and its greatest failures by not talking.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.000]   "It doesn't have to be like this.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.240]   "Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   "With the technology at our disposal,
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.160]   "the possibilities are unbounded.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.520]   "All we need to do is make sure we keep talking."
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   Thank you for listening.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.120]   I'd hope to see you next time.
