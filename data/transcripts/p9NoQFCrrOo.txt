[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's fashion. Thank you for being here in person.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.280]   Thank you for having me.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280]   Yeah. So for people who don't know you, I gave a little bit of an intro,
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.640]   but tell me about how you got into this game.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.320]   Yeah, I kind of started my career in finance, moved into tech,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.860]   did a bunch of startup stuff and then got very obsessed of points,
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.220]   mostly because my player to Mandy wanted to travel a ton.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.400]   And I was like, how do I do all this stuff about paying an arm and a leg?
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.700]   I think one big trip that really pushed it was a last minute Japan trip.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.840]   And we paid something like twelve or thirteen hundred dollars for economy.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.700]   And I'm like, wait, why am I paying so much money for economy?
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.280]   And then I found to this whole points rabbit hole.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520]   I knew about credit cards before, but I was always on team cashback
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.540]   back in the day where I was like, oh, just optimize your categories.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.920]   And that makes the most sense.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   But then I realized you can get so much more value from points
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.060]   and that actually moves the needle the most compared to cashback.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.480]   Like I like cashback.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.860]   I think a lot of people can benefit from it, especially if you have a family
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.820]   and you're not traveling as much or you just don't care about that.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.360]   But I think especially when you're young, points drive so much value
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.800]   and just open so many doors.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.500]   Is there a type of travel you think is necessary for points to be worth it?
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.240]   I think it does lean more towards aspirational business
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.200]   and like first class type of trips are just like more expensive trips
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.500]   for economy stuff.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.880]   I still pay out of pocket generally because the value is not there
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.180]   or I get OK value, like maybe one point five to two cents per point.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.920]   But it's not like the astronomical 10 cents per point.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.580]   So for me, a lot of it is like, how do I as a P get the VIP experience
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.660]   and unlock this whole thing that I didn't think I could do?
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660]   Like growing up, like pretty lower middle class.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.700]   I never thought I'd be able to fly business, let alone first.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.740]   So the fact that I can actually like even even if it's just for a few hours,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.140]   like see what it's like to be on the other side and experience that
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280]   and see these other people who are like dropping 20K on these flights.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.120]   It's I don't know if it's nice.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.720]   It feels really good to sit next to someone be like, how much do you pay?
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   I haven't actually asked.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.260]   I don't know if you ever asked, but I've always wanted to ask.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.220]   How much did you pay for that?
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.760]   I've done that in Bora Bora,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.460]   where we were just hanging out and talking to other people.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.800]   And then some people were like, oh, I pay 30.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.940]   And then someone else was like, oh, you guys are losers.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.960]   We did it through Costco and we paid twenty five thousand.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.480]   And I was like, oh, I didn't pay that much money at all.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   But I didn't want to like burst their bubble.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840]   But you kind of did you kind of just to open them.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.240]   But next time, here's the tricks.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840]   Yeah, I think a lot of people like the idea of points.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.580]   But then like it's one of those things that you keep in mind,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.780]   but you never really act on it.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.580]   I like a lot of people will be like, oh, you can get a lot of value.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.480]   That's nice. Whatever.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760]   Yeah. So it is tough, I think, to like make that switch.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.020]   And like that first step is always harder.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.220]   So I want to come back to these aspirational trips at the end.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.060]   But first.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.800]   I feel like there are very few people that are as in tune
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.500]   with everything that's going on with the points, miles, status world.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.140]   So I wanted to just bring up the topic of where we're at right now.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.600]   We're recording this in September 2023.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.080]   Delta has just kind of told everyone that loves flying Delta
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.280]   that it's going to be a lot harder to get status
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.640]   unless you spend a ridiculous amount of money.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.320]   By this point, we probably already will have covered the major news there.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.480]   But at the high level, status is changing
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.080]   and it has on other airlines over the past few years.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.500]   Where do you feel like things are in the world of points and miles?
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.660]   What's happening now?
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.060]   So I feel like most of the airlines have told people that
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.300]   either intentionally or unintentionally, that they actually don't care
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.500]   if you fly them a lot.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.940]   They care more so how much money you spend with them.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.080]   So even if you look at your net, it's changed from like the old system
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.180]   to the current one.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.340]   It's very much contingent on you spending either a crap ton of money
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.960]   on your credit cards or flying a lot of them.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.680]   But then it's not even economy flying that you want, like premium
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.420]   last minute business class type flying where you might be going to the airport
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.460]   and paying $1,000 for like SFO to LAX.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.920]   So Delta's kind of in that same realm.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.160]   They have simplified the whole process a lot more,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.100]   but it's still very much targeted towards businesses.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.560]   Like even back in the day, you could get two Delta Reserve cards.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.140]   Spending your way there was about $240K, but it was a complicated.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.040]   You were like learning about MQT waivers, MQM boosts and stuff like that.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.980]   And now it's like just spend $400K, spend $400K and you get status or $350K.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.440]   Yeah. A lot of money for most businesses.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.080]   And do you care about status?
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.520]   Is it something that at least let's start with airlines?
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.280]   Is that something you're even trying to get anymore?
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.400]   So I think a lot of people don't rightfully don't like status
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.620]   for a lot of good reasons because they don't get upgrades.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.960]   So back in the day, we were chasing United status.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.800]   And then I think the most we ever got up to was platinum.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.280]   And then we realized that out of SFO, because like 43 or 50%
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.880]   of people flying through SFO like planes are United.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.340]   So you're never going to get upgraded because there's too many people
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.020]   that have one K and global services that you can chase it.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.860]   But you're not it's not going to help you as much as you think it is.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.980]   So you pretty much want to get status with the second or third
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.860]   most like busiest airline from that airport.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.460]   And for us as a fellow, it was Delta.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.900]   And then if you're in Atlanta, obviously you wouldn't want Delta
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.100]   because there's too many Delta members
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.240]   and people who like just have unlimited corporate account money.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.300]   So for us, we got Delta status.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.180]   We liked it a lot because we were getting upgraded for our cross-country flights.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.140]   We also fly during weird times.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.980]   So that kind of helps.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.620]   But like being able to get a decent business class seat
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.580]   for five or six hours is nice with the new change.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.280]   I think we're kind of on the fence about how to play it.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.760]   So next year, we're still going to be Delta Diamond.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.860]   The year after that, I think unless we have some like weird
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.960]   astronomical business spend, it just doesn't make sense.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.660]   And then even then it's like, well, there's an opportunity cost of like
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.260]   should I spend all this money on this card when I can just use a city
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.700]   double cash or like a lot of other cards where you get more value, right?
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.580]   I think we might chase American status mostly because the spend amount
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.440]   seems pretty reasonable for what we for the level that we want.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.180]   And then for that level, pretty much the one below
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.780]   EXP, so I think it's platinum platinum pro.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.780]   Yeah, that one gets you one world emerald status,
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.960]   which gets you in the first class lounges when you're flying abroad.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.200]   So we go to Hong Kong like three to four times a year.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.260]   And if I can scroll up into like the cafe Pacific first class lounge
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.840]   while flying economy or premium economy, that's not bad at all. No.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.580]   It's funny, my adventures with status started with
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.940]   let's try to chase the highest status on United because we lived in
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.840]   San Francisco.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.780]   And then it was, well, we're really only taking short haul trips
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.120]   where I just don't care or really long haul trips or using our points.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.760]   Forget it. No status.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.420]   So for the last four or five years, no status.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.260]   And the one place where it started to bite us back was now we have two kids
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.360]   and we have an au pair.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.100]   And sometimes we're traveling with four people or four, five people, four seats.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.780]   And the reality, we just did a trip with no check bags.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.780]   But the reality is when you're traveling with four, you got to check bags.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.580]   And it was just like an added fee.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.120]   So it's like, do I want to get a credit card to cover the cost?
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.000]   Or there was a challenge for United, which was like just in reach.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.840]   It was like spend $1,200 in in three or four months on United.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.420]   And we had a couple trips planned.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.280]   So I went for it.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.680]   And now I'm worried that I'm like kind of getting caught up in this silver.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.180]   For anyone listening who knows United status, silver basically is like
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.600]   free checkbacks, like economy plus a check in if it happens to be available.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.460]   So it's not special, but I'm finally back on that train.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.240]   And now I find myself doing what I wanted to not do, which was
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.840]   I just want to take the easiest, most convenient flight.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.640]   Now I find myself like, oh, can I take the United flights?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   I'm going to get free check bags.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.040]   I will just get a credit card then.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.440]   I feel like that makes so much more sense.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.540]   You get like all the perks of silver or like even cold status
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.580]   without having to worry about that.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.540]   Yeah, I don't know why.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.780]   I think it's because I had a United card for so long.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.120]   And then I just forgot to put a transaction on it and they closed it.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.460]   And I was like, oh, do I have to really go back and get another new United card?
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.360]   But yes, it's another intro bonus.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.880]   Well, OK, so we'll come to that.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   But yeah, so it seemed like it fit in.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.340]   So I did it.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.140]   We're going to get some free checked bags out of it.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.940]   But at the end of the day, I feel like it's just the credit card
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.520]   can give you the low tier of status, which is like checked bags.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.380]   You're probably not going to get preferred seats with any cards.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.860]   Not with the United cards.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.920]   Delta does get you upgrades even if you don't have status.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.400]   But you're not going to like you're not going to get business or first
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.460]   and even first is domestic first, which isn't that exciting.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.360]   But like you'll probably get like the premium comfort plus equivalent.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.460]   So I'll probably play the play the cards through that.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.740]   What about hotels?
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.280]   We don't talk a lot about hotel status.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.880]   It feels like in the points and miles world, it's Hyatt Globalist or forget it.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.820]   I think a big part of it, too, is because airline status is so hard
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.180]   to get with credit cards while they're kind of given out willy nilly
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.920]   with credit cards, hotel status is given out willy nilly.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.720]   So you have like all these cards that give you either like mid level
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   or even like higher level status.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.400]   Hilton Diamond being one of the prime examples, right?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.160]   Like you're getting a top level status by getting a credit card that runs you 450.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.240]   And then I would argue that the card actually is a net positive
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.400]   because of all the credits and the free night.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.900]   So you have all these people that have status because the math makes sense.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.700]   And like I think people that watch YouTube are like, oh, yeah,
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.680]   if you run the numbers, it's logical.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.480]   So I think the reason people like Hyatt is because that's the one
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.320]   you actually had to chase and had to do, meaning that there's less people
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.620]   that have it, meaning that it's more beneficial because upgrades
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.660]   actually come to you.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.500]   If you have like 10,000 people that have status compared to 1000,
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.000]   that's up, especially in the US.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.160]   Internationally, though, it doesn't really matter
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.560]   because everyone else doesn't have status.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   So like we'll go to like these like other like Southeast Asia,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.140]   like the name or something, and they'll be like, oh, thank you for being like
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.240]   diamond and and for your two stays this year.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.180]   And I was like, yeah, thank you.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.080]   Thank you for having me, because they don't see that many business travelers
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.720]   and their credit cards don't come with status like ours do.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.020]   Yeah, I think we've had that experience in Southeast Asia
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.660]   also with Marriott or the former Starwood.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.500]   Any status was great.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.640]   And I think Marriott, you can also get platinum with one card.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.140]   Mary, you can get it with the Bonvoy Brilliant now
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.180]   before you had to spend 50 K before you had to spend 75 K to get it.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.180]   And now you get it, which I think is good
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   because a lot of hotels can be free breakfast as well
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   and then upgrades up to like standard suites.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.760]   Is there a hotel chain that if you were building loyalty, is it is it Hyatt?
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.460]   I found recently on Hilton, I dug into the terms.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.860]   It was like, even if there's a nice room, they don't have to give it to you.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.500]   Yeah, I think a lot of Hilton's are kind of annoying in that way
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.940]   because they'll lean into the terms
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.900]   and then it depends on who owns the hotel and the upgrade policies.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.440]   But it's they lean very literally on the can give you an upgrade
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.400]   versus will give an upgrade.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.200]   But theoretically, it just depends on the person.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.240]   And then sometimes if you're nicer to them, I find that they are more likely
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.040]   to give you upgrades in the US.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.420]   They just don't like I'll point out sometimes I'll open up the app and be like,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.680]   hey, there is like a junior suite available.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.260]   There's like three of them tonight.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.880]   It's like, can I get upgraded to this?
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.660]   It's like, oh, it's not available in my system.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.020]   Like, OK, like I get that they maybe have sales quotas,
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.200]   but still, it's annoying on that end.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.000]   Are there are there any chains where you feel like you haven't had that problem?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.200]   Because I imagine you probably have hotel status on all of them.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.540]   Yeah, I feel like Hyatt is one of the best ones for that.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.740]   That's why I like Hyatt.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.540]   But their footprint is so much smaller.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.780]   IHG is probably the worst with it, where even if you have like ambassador
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.440]   or like the top level status, they'll try to upsell you.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.120]   Like we stayed at like an intercontinental and it was like empty.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.860]   It was like during Christmas in Houston, and they were just trying to upsell us
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.720]   rooms, we're like, oh, can we get a tour of it?
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   And I was filming the room.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.860]   So I'm like, still get a free review of the room out of it.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.960]   But then it's like, yeah, that'll be an extra two hundred.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.900]   It's like, isn't this nice?
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.540]   I'm like, I think your hotel is not that busy.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.440]   It's like it's Christmas Eve.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.600]   Like, why are you trying to upsell me?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.500]   And so if we look ahead, because I feel like you have a pretty good sense of this.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.280]   Where do you think we'll start with status and then we'll move into credit cards?
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.480]   But where do you think 2024, what are we going to see?
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   Are we going to see lots of big changes to programs?
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.060]   Do you think they've kind of all made their changes recently?
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.760]   Focusing airlines on spend and hotels, I guess, haven't really made too many changes.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.400]   Is anything changing?
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.000]   I think American can be really smart here and like they could actually even do
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.640]   campaigns where they like bring Delta people over and convert them really well.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.400]   So I think they should do that, but they're not doing it.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.880]   I think United's in a good spot where they're like, we don't really care.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.480]   Delta.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.120]   I wonder if Delta will backstep the decision, but I kind of feel like they won't.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.220]   So some people pointed to the fact that like they did make some changes
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.880]   because people complained and petitioned and it took like two years or something.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.020]   But I'm like, is it really worth your effort doing it?
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.960]   Number one.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.760]   And number two, is it like even if they do make a change,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.960]   it's probably still going to be like a mid-step
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.360]   where it's just not going to be good for you anyways.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.600]   So I think there are a lot of people pushing for change
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.680]   and like telling people to call the board of directors.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.900]   But it feels like a fiduciary move.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.640]   Like they make they made a decision that makes sense for the company.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.880]   I've heard the argument that Delta has the best product,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.020]   like the best hard product on the plane, seats, service amenities, everything.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.260]   And so they can kind of afford to do this, because if you live in Atlanta,
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.460]   are you really going to change what you do like or not?
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.300]   And then American doesn't have the best product.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.660]   And so they're like, we're going to make our program work for anyone.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.240]   And Delta is kind of like, look, we're really good.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.200]   We don't need as easy of a program and it might work.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.540]   And I think it will actually attract the people they want,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.320]   because even within the diamond rings, there are a lot of people that have status.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.680]   So by moving the bar higher up, that means there's less diamonds,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.020]   but probably more people that are higher off, like with businesses
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.960]   that spend more money that want to buy these tickets
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.860]   or like who spend a lot on their credit cards.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.960]   So it kind of just works out for them where like they have a better experience
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.460]   within the diamond rank.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.600]   So not everyone here is focused on status on hotels or airlines,
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.660]   but I think a lot of people here are focused on credit cards.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.760]   What do you think is changing?
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.240]   The only big changes recently, and I say big, like if I look back over 2023,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.140]   I don't feel like there was a lot that changed in the credit card game.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.340]   But what do you think?
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.380]   I feel like it's mostly the Venture X coming into the ecosystem
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.720]   and then like disrupting everything.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.920]   And now the Venture X business can disrupting on the business side.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.020]   I would argue that even that card is actually the best business card out there.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.500]   If you can use the credits and points and stuff.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.620]   I think we probably at some point we'll see a bit more devaluation over there
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.760]   because it's kind of the Chase Sapphire Reserve strategy where you come in,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.420]   you like break down doors, but then like you have to take a few steps back
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.140]   afterwards and like either increase the annual fee or like decrease in benefits
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.160]   after you get the market share.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.540]   I think Citi is the big question mark that a lot of people have
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.900]   because they got rid of the prestige card and they haven't really been
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.500]   in this travel ecosystem.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.880]   So like for a long time, they were in that for a long time.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.740]   They were actually in first place and the platinum kind of like pushed past it.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.720]   But I think back in like 2017,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.280]   all the consultants had the Citi prestige because it was like an amazing card
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.220]   where they had this fourth night free perk.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.560]   And if you were traveling for four nights every week,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.020]   you would actually just get a ton of like statement credits
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.800]   and like kind of free money through your credit card.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.540]   So the question is whether they're going to try to like come back
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.240]   into the top three or whether they'll try to go for the top again
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.680]   and how they play that.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.480]   Well, it seems like Citi has there's rumors that a new card is coming.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   Yeah, the Strata Elite and Strata.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.680]   Yeah, but we don't know what it is.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.980]   We have no clue what it looks like or what it's going to do
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.880]   or whether it's going to be competitive, right?
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.220]   Like for the most for all we know, like they could come into the ecosystem
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.520]   and then if it's just like the luxury black card that is expensive
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.620]   but isn't good, then it's going to lose.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.160]   I also think I've heard someone make very, very edge cases for Citi points.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.600]   But if you already have some Amex points or Chase and Capital One,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.340]   adding Citi doesn't get you much new,
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.440]   many new options other than I think Eva Air.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.780]   Yeah, and then Eva Air is not even that good of an option.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.260]   No, I'm not making a case for for like, go get a Citi card.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.960]   So you get some points.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.000]   I just think I think that was the only one that stood out as the unique option.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.560]   And I know I'm a phony there.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.340]   It's great business class, and it is great.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.300]   And the economy is great.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.200]   Like they're just very friendly. Yeah.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.000]   And and I think they make some of their space available just to their program.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.200]   So maybe that's a chase point or a Citi point benefit.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.440]   I think for most people, the reason they go for Citi
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.620]   is because you've depleted all your chase options and then Amex is once
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.180]   in a lifetime, and then it's easy to deplete those options as well,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.160]   because there's only so many MR earning cards.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.860]   So you run and then you do Capital One generally early on.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.300]   So Citi is that next logical step.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.700]   And the fact that they do have
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.460]   some pretty good cards of like catch all options as multipliers,
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.240]   double cash being the good like two X equivalent.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.900]   And then the Citi Premier is also surprisingly good, like as a workhorse,
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.500]   because it earns three X on so many categories.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.780]   Gas is a big one that a lot of other like banks just don't focus on
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.520]   or they know that it's going to be like a money loser.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.620]   So they just don't really focus on it at all.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.880]   And the fact that Citi Premier earns a three X on it and it's uncapped
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.820]   is pretty good.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.920]   And on Citi cards, I'll just you know, for any cards we talk about,
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.860]   if you go to all the hacks dot com slash cards, you can find the links
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.660]   for all the cards we're talking about, except Citi.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.760]   We don't have any partners there, but you do.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.860]   So if anyone here wants to get any of the cards that we're talking about,
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.900]   obviously support me.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.560]   But also, if it's a Citi card, I'll send them your way.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.460]   Yeah. Asksebi.com again.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.160]   Asksebi.com A S K S E B B Y dot com.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.900]   We'll put the link to that in the show notes.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.840]   And what do you think's coming?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.200]   So the only big change.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.240]   So Venture X is a big thing.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.340]   I think we have two of them in our house.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.940]   Venture X business, I'm torn on.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.040]   It's a massive sign up bonus.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.180]   I think it's one hundred fifty thousand.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.580]   But you have to spend thirty grand in three months.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:09.680]   But I already have the spark cash plus, which is effectively equivalent.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.420]   But I would argue that the annual fee there is a bit higher
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.560]   because you don't have that many credits offsetting.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.420]   I think there's one where if you spend like one hundred or one fifty K,
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.300]   you get like one hundred back or something.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.200]   One fifty back.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.240]   I don't know if I put that much on it.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.360]   But basically, there's nothing to help you offset it.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.280]   While the Venture X business has the same three hundred dollars
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.480]   and ten thousand points.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.980]   So for me, that's already like, OK,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.220]   that covers annual fee more or less.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.820]   Or you get five dollars in value.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.280]   So that's cheaper on a net basis.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.420]   And then you also have a priority pass card that works for restaurants.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.320]   So if you don't want to run Chase Sapphire Reserve or JP Morgan Reserve,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.960]   then that's an option.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.300]   OK. And does the Venture X?
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.700]   The Venture X one works for only lounges.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.860]   But the business is.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.600]   The business as a filming works for restaurants as well.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.200]   Oh, interesting. I didn't know that.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.400]   And then I think one of the other big changes was Amex
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.040]   pulling back on Delta lounges.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.540]   And I guess maybe I think it was it was it this year
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.640]   where they also cut back on guest policies.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.600]   So I don't know if you spend 75 K.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.240]   So I think for them, they're just trying to figure out
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.920]   how to make the lounge experience better, because if you have to wait
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.380]   30 minutes to one hour to go into the lounge, then it's like a lose
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   lose for that because people start canceling cards.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.220]   People post on social media that the line sucks and that this is terrible.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.220]   So how do you make it accessible to people,
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.160]   but also like make it a good experience?
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.000]   So I think for them, they've toyed around with increasing the annual fee.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.240]   And I think that is something that we're probably bound to see in 2025.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.380]   But then the platinum has done so well in the last two years
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.740]   because people have started doing the math and realize that it makes sense
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.220]   that there's just so many like the platinum numbers have doubled
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.260]   in the last like four or five years, which is a lot of people.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.720]   And then the lounges have not kept up to it to that.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.120]   Yeah. And then also a lot more people are traveling now.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.860]   And I think there's also like younger people who might be getting it
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.100]   because of the perks or the flex on people and stuff.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.780]   So it's just a lot of people have the cards and the lounge side has not kept up.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.120]   Aside from lounge changes, what do you think happens with cards next year?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.920]   Like, what do you think the you know, in a year from now when we're catching up,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.340]   what is going to be the Venture X thing we talked about?
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.200]   I think a lot of people don't like high annual fees for exchange of credits,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.940]   but I think that's the most logical move for like issuers and like everyone.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.080]   Like it feels like the most win, win, win.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.680]   So what I mean by that is, let's say you have a card that has an 850 annual fee,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.820]   but you have like twelve hundred credits.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.060]   So some people hate that because they're like, well, I can't use all these credits
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.960]   because I think we're conditioned to want to maximize everything.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.900]   But the goal is necessarily to use every single credit to get enough value
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.120]   that you maybe break even for the credit card that way, like it's 815 credits.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.700]   So all the other perks and the multipliers of the card
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.040]   and of just being value on top.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.400]   So like positive expected value from it.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.860]   So I think we're going to see more of that.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.700]   Probably Citi's going to push that.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.080]   But I think that's the most logical move because issuers make money.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.340]   They probably have a bit more room to give you better multipliers, too.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.680]   And then for the people that would benefit from those credits,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.260]   it's also a win because you might come out ahead.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.340]   Like for the platinum card, if you live in certain cities,
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.560]   if you don't use certain products, you might actually be losing money
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.680]   or you might be paying that two or three hundred dollars
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.320]   in order to get the card for lounge access and other perks.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.780]   But there are people that live in New York and the Bay Area
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.900]   who already pay for Equinox where like they come out ahead.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.020]   They're like, wait, I use all these services.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.860]   I use Uber. I use Equinox.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.400]   I like, yeah, I shop at Saks enough that I can use the credit.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.460]   So it's I think we're going to see more of that,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.500]   which might end up pissing some people off, but it's probably a net positive move.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.340]   Yeah, I think.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.300]   I probably come out.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.680]   I wish I used Equinox so that I could get the value, but I'm pretty confident
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.320]   that just starting to use Equinox is going to not be a net net savings.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.360]   So one tactic you can actually do is if you have a friend that uses Equinox,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.060]   you could just let them swap your card in for a month and I'll use up the credit
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.960]   and then they can just treat you to dinner or something.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.720]   That's what kind of I'm doing right now.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.340]   I have like a lot of Platinum cards and then I'm just like, hey,
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.760]   Humphrey, you pay for Equinox already.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.100]   Anyways, I have these like eight Platinum cards.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.160]   Do you want to swap them in every single month
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.240]   to use up the credit and then you can pay for sushi?
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.500]   I'm just going to stand outside of the Equinox in in the Bay Area.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.180]   So it's a portal every month. So it's easier.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.240]   And I feel like there's bound to be a lot of tech people, you know, that have it.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.040]   But it's just a weird conversation.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.940]   Yeah, probably not worth the brain cells.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.580]   Yeah. If I only have one.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.820]   So if I had eight, maybe it would be worth finding that person.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.580]   What do you think happens on the earning side?
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.860]   I know there was a big scare, I guess, when we thought this legislation
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.760]   was going to pass and cause all these challenges.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.200]   It looks like it's not.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.260]   Do you think credit card companies in the next year?
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.240]   Do you think that comes back?
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.940]   Do you think we see kind of legislation to try to limit the interchange
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.040]   that card companies can make?
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.280]   I think people are still going to try to push for it,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.340]   whether it goes through or not is the big question.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   If it does go through, I think it actually kind of destroys
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.480]   their credit card space in a lot of ways.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   I think in the short term,
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.660]   we will see issuers just keep doing the same thing
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.620]   and maybe increasing the multipliers.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.460]   It's really hard to do the opposite of like, like if you if someone told you
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.540]   we're going from 4x to 3x, that's going to piss off so many people
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.840]   and get so much churn from it that you're probably better off
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.940]   keeping the numbers and then trying to make money back somewhere else,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.780]   whether that's like decreasing perks or increasing annual fees,
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.340]   because I think people are used to like that cycle of upgrades.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.580]   And then you can always argue inflation like, hey, technically 250
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.220]   two years ago is now like 350 or 300.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.360]   Yeah, I think one of the hardest parts for cards is all the transfer ratios
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.300]   for the most part are all one to one.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.700]   And it seems so simple to keep it one to one
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.560]   that they can't really pull that lever easily so they can pull perks.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.340]   Do you think we'll ever see cards where it's like here are four perks.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.800]   You get to pick two of them.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.440]   I kind of wish Citi would do that or like any other issuer.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.080]   I think that's like an interesting play and like gamifies it a lot more.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.680]   But I'm not sure if the normal card user that's not a super user
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.920]   would like that because it might sound too confusing.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.820]   I think right now you probably have at least eight
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.120]   priority pass memberships and you don't need them.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.420]   No, not at all.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.300]   Yeah, if I could even take like a $50 credit or something per year,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.260]   that would be nice.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.660]   And I think or maybe a $50 credit for something else
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.460]   for like Barry's Bootcamp or something.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.840]   So I think that would be cool.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.480]   Yeah, but I think it just brings up a different conversation now
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.800]   because for the platinum.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.080]   The whole draw is that, oh, I can get $1,400 in value.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.020]   I might not, but I can.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.080]   So there's that potential of getting outsized value
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.860]   that I think people like latch on to.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.880]   And they love to market that. Yes.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.660]   And I like even for my like calculations and stuff, I'm like,
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.060]   you need to knock it down for your own case.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.900]   Like we have calculators on asksebi.com for this.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.540]   But for I think the moment you're like, OK, cool.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.360]   That's a 900 annual fee, but you have 800 credits, but you have to pick the ones.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.400]   It ends up like not being the best for them,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.000]   for the company or for people that are signing up.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.040]   It's only good for us.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.140]   And I'm pretty sure they're not optimizing for us.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.740]   Do you think the car like the credit card companies
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.380]   like power users because they tell their friends and their friends aren't?
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.920]   Or do they like secretly wish that they could put a red flag
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   on all of our accounts and close us all down?
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.460]   I think we represent such a small number that they probably don't care.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   I think it's kind of like reminiscent of the casinos where there's people
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.860]   that can't count cards, right?
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.540]   Like you actually want people to think that they can go in and count cards
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.540]   and like movies like that to like propagate.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.780]   But like the average person, just even if they mentally can't do it,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.940]   they're not going to spend the time to learn how to do it
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.040]   or they'll think about how to do the process.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.440]   So by having this whole thing, like, oh, you can get money,
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.080]   but maybe they don't do enough research, then they end up losing.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.560]   But the people that watch videos and like read blogs
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.760]   are probably already a lot ahead of everyone else.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.820]   So we talked about how you have eight platinum cards, which is a little crazy.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.140]   And I think one of the things that people often miss about the game
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.800]   is we get so caught up in, OK, well, which card is going to give me
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.180]   the most number of points for how I spend my money?
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.140]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.640]   Like I am, you know, I've created a tool where people can actually go in
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.280]   and put their spend in and figure out the right optimal use of cards,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.920]   because at the end of the day, no one wants to leave points on the table.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.620]   However, when I think about it and I just start doing the math,
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.420]   even with the best card, if you could have a 5X points on everything card
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.260]   and your return was 5X, welcome bonuses seem to be better than that.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.940]   Almost always.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.700]   Is there an argument that all you should be ever chasing is welcome bonuses
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.740]   and you should not be focused on any multipliers and bonuses?
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.000]   So I think it's kind of interesting where a lot of people who spend less money
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.980]   focus more on multipliers when they should be focusing on intro bonuses,
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.440]   because that drives more money if you're spending only 500 a month.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.600]   Getting 200 back for that 500 just makes a lot more sense.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   And you can actually repeat that so many times because there's so many cards.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.200]   But like that 5% on 500 is not material at all.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.820]   So ironically, the people that should be focused on multipliers
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.240]   are the high spenders, the ones that are spending five or ten thousand dollars
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.540]   a month eating out.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.840]   And like, I think some people look at them and be like, that's absurd.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.440]   Who does that?
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.440]   But like there are people that spend a ton of money.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.480]   Like for those people, the multipliers start to matter a lot more
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.700]   because that's already 25,000 points in one month, potentially, depending on the card.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.080]   So for most people, especially when you're starting out, focus on intro bonuses.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   That drives the needle.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.620]   That's like 20% return on spend to 40%, depending on the card.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.260]   But I think once you ramp up, once you have a business at some point,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.620]   like you just run out of bonuses.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.600]   Like if you're if you have an ad business that if you have a business
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.860]   that runs a lot of Facebook ads, you're spending 200k a month.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.140]   It's like there's not enough intro bonuses for you to go for.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.560]   So you do start to focus on multipliers or maybe getting hotel status
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.820]   or airline status with that spend.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:08.240]   Yeah. But if you're someone who has dabbled, right, you've opened two or three cards
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.920]   and maybe you're spending, I don't know, five, seven grand a month.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.080]   So you're kind of on that high end, but you haven't opened up a ton of cards.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.580]   Even if you're a high spender, if you've only opened up a few cards in your time,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.200]   it probably makes sense to focus on intro bonuses.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.420]   I think so.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.800]   I think you can argue that one a lot more because like you're in that weird mid spot.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.720]   But for me, intro bonuses, especially travel ones, just drive so much value.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.880]   And it's like, would you rather spend maybe three or four months
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.060]   of spending to get the same bonus or maybe one month?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.680]   And especially if you are trying to time towards like a honeymoon
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.600]   or any other like big endeavor where you need a lot of points,
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.980]   it just makes more sense.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.180]   So to me, I think intro bonuses are the focus,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.100]   especially when you're young and you like have time to manage stuff.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.860]   Anyways, like we have kids, then obviously maybe that's not worth your time.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.480]   I don't know. I would.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.240]   I would push back and say, even if you're going to spend the time
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.400]   to figure out what card earns the most points,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.860]   you'd probably be better off just getting another card
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.420]   unless you've played the game so heavily that you're out of cards.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.200]   Yeah. So again, which you probably are.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.340]   So my view is you should probably like work your way to like 10,
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.580]   20 or like 50 cards, but obviously like that's not everyone.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.340]   And I want to be cognizant that like some people do have like lives.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.760]   Like I like researching stuff like on a Friday night.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.960]   I think we'll like watch Netflix, hang out, have dinner.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.640]   But then like at night, I'm like just randomly researching stuff
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.840]   and going down rabbit holes.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.220]   Sometimes it's not credit card related.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.060]   Sometimes it's like travel.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.820]   Sometimes it's something completely different, like mechanical keyboards.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.940]   But like I like researching stuff.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.240]   I enjoy learning.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.780]   But like I know some people who are like, no, I'd rather
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.200]   be spending more time with my kids or like partying or clubbing or whatever else.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.280]   So I think it just depends on you.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.740]   And so you said potentially 50.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.200]   Let's pretend someone listening is like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.580]   I was doing this game wrong.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.500]   What is I want to address a few things.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.420]   So one I've noticed from people that have published.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.000]   Here's me opening up a high velocity of cards over a short period of time.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.840]   The impact on your credit is surprisingly positive.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.800]   So I think that's a misconception a lot of people have is, oh,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.760]   if I opened up five, six, seven, eight cards in a year, it would destroy my credit.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.400]   I'm pretty sure my experience from people that have reported it
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.020]   and from the few times where I did that is the exact opposite is true.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.280]   Is that what you've seen?
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.320]   For the most part? Yes.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.060]   I think short term, you might see a dip.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.020]   And then especially if you're a student, you'll see a bigger dip.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.020]   And I think that's when they get like spooked by it.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.080]   But I think especially if you're like in the twenty five to thirty and like
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.080]   especially later on range where you already have these older cards
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.740]   anyways to like be your anchor and your foundation, the impact is so minimal.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.880]   And unless you're like shopping for a mortgage or like something like that,
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.080]   it doesn't really matter.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.220]   Like, oh, no, my credit score dropped from 800 to 750.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.500]   Like that plays no role.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   And that and a 50 point drop like that would not be one card.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.220]   That would be over a series.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.300]   That would probably be over a series unless you had a very thin file.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.020]   Like if you only had like one card and then this is your second card, then yeah,
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.480]   you might see a 50 point drop.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.640]   OK, and so how would you think about that sequence if you were someone
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.480]   that's like, OK, let's get a card, a quarter this year?
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.680]   I think earlier you referenced like, you know, Capital One might be early.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.480]   Is there a high level version of how you would think about where to start?
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.900]   Yeah, I generally think of it as stages.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.520]   So Chase being kind of the first off set of stuff because of Chase 524
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.320]   and how they like limit cards and then also their business cards
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.580]   are pretty lucrative and you can like get a lot of them while you're under 524.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.160]   And we've talked about this at length, but I'll just just for anyone
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.460]   who's who's new to 524 when Chase looks to approve you for a card,
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.340]   they look and if you've opened and it's not a published rule,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.460]   but it's kind of everyone has seen it work.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.920]   If you open more than five cards in the last 24 months across all issuers
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.180]   on your personal, on your personal report, they're going to stop you.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.380]   So if you've opened five and you try to open a business card,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.680]   they're going to say no.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.320]   But if you open a business card, it doesn't show up on your personal report
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   on Chase.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.900]   And so you can you could open up five business cards
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.440]   and then open up a personal card and be OK, because the business card
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.400]   is not going to show up from Chase.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.780]   It will from Capital One.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.400]   Yes. And yeah, some other issuers, but most issuers don't.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.700]   And then that's why a lot of people end up just kind of going.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.320]   Once you're at 424, you kind of go down the ink list.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.220]   And then especially if you have an EIN and like different options there,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.840]   you can technically get a lot of ink bonuses from each of your businesses.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.760]   And we have you have a whole business channel on YouTube
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.600]   that I bet people can go deep, deep down a rabbit hole.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.940]   Ask Sebby business.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.640]   Yeah. And so I think a lot of people would be surprised
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.940]   that they probably do something in their life
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.820]   that would qualify them for a business card,
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.480]   even if they're not running a business with employees.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.160]   So that's definitely something to look at.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.320]   And OK, so Chase is kind of where you start
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.700]   because of their kind of application rules is there.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.380]   So application rules and also number of intra bonuses
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.120]   and then the value of intra bonuses.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.580]   And then the fact that a lot of their cards have downgrade paths
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.000]   and a no annual fee options.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.380]   And also a lot of the ones that don't are just keeper cards.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.840]   So once where you get value every year by keeping it.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.140]   Hotel cards being one of the best examples of this.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.440]   After that, I would do Capital One mostly because they can be pretty hard
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.940]   to get approved for if you have very high velocity and you have a lot of cards.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.640]   So like there are people out there who have an 800 credit score,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.340]   who make like two, 300 K, but who will not get approved for the Venture X
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.060]   because Capital One knows that you're not profitable.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.220]   So you generally want to like get your foot in that door early on.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.940]   Saver, Saver One, Venture, Venture X are all pretty good cards for that.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.480]   And they also just make sense, like they're good cards by themselves.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.400]   If you hadn't opened a lot of Chase cards and you're sitting at zero 24 or 124,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.800]   would you make a case to maybe start with a big bonus on a Venture X up front?
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.140]   I think that's one of the few issuers
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.720]   I would consider like burning a 524 slot for, but.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.060]   Yeah, I would probably I'd probably still go through Chase personally,
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.160]   but depends on you. OK.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.480]   And is it as simple as.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.200]   You know, Chase 524, if I'm at 124, can I just go open up
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.160]   four cards in the next 90 days or you generally want to get a new card?
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.540]   I would say every one to three months and then for business cards
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.740]   every two to three months.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.880]   So you kind of want to just like path it out based off what you're trying to do.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.160]   iXG Premier World of Hyatt are all pretty good cards.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.420]   Boundless is interesting, especially if you want to like in the future
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.120]   upgrade to the Ritz card, which is another rabbit hole.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.880]   United cards are good for the bonuses and downgrade paths and perks.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.000]   If you want free checked bags.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.060]   Aeroplanes just a really good bonus, but doesn't have a downgrade path.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.060]   But yeah, there's like a lot of cards you can get that just provide a lot of value.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.760]   Yeah, I think Chase is probably if you made a list of the
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.400]   the issuer with the most six figure bonuses, it's like always chase.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.560]   Yeah. And then if you look at bonuses across the board, it's like
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.020]   who really has a lot of bonuses, it's American Express and Chase.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.320]   And that's why it's like you want to focus on Chase early on
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.080]   because you want to get those bonuses.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.700]   And then a lot of the bonuses are also on like a 24 month clock, where if you
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.240]   don't currently have the card and you haven't got the bonus in 24 months,
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.100]   you would actually be eligible for that bonus again.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.660]   So a lot of people start off chase, kind of go through everything else,
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.400]   and then you can circle back to chase.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.240]   Yeah. One thing that I think you'll find if you get to your fourth
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.780]   or fifth chase card is you might get denied right away.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.540]   And you can often, at least in my experience, call up.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.080]   And the denial isn't that they don't want to give you the card.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.880]   It's they just don't want to give you any more credit.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.000]   And you could say, oh, well, can you move some credit over from this other card
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.460]   I have that has a twenty five thousand dollar limit?
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.880]   You just put 10 there and bring 15 over.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.980]   Yeah. So chase generally wants to give you about 50 percent of your income
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.220]   as your total credit limit for them.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   That's kind of like what they're willing to risk.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.440]   So if you make 100, then among all your chase cards,
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.560]   total limit should be around 50 K.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.200]   So you can also carve room, which is what I call it,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.820]   where you like intentionally decrease credit limits
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.040]   to just make it easier to get approved.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.580]   So like, let's say if you have a 200 K salary, you know that your cap is 100 K.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.380]   If you already have 100 K and you're not using all your credit limit anyways,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.460]   it's like, why not just decrease one of these cards by five K?
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.260]   Can you do that?
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.520]   Can you just ask them for a credit decrease?
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.380]   Yes, you can.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.980]   And then that makes it easier to get approved.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.720]   And like, obviously, some people will be like, I'd rather call in.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.220]   I don't owe getting credit limit decreases are as dumb.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.440]   Why would anyone do that?
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.860]   But like as someone who doesn't like calling in and waiting on the phone
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.600]   and stuff like I'd rather just send a message saying decrease my credit limit
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.660]   by five K, that's immaterial to me.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.120]   And like if it makes the approval process easier, then that's a win.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.940]   Do you think there's an argument of like that actually working more often?
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.900]   Like, is there a situation where I think that's easier?
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.540]   And I think my rationale is that it's lower risk
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.120]   because I think any time you have more eyes on your account,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.500]   it's a negative thing.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.220]   So I don't want to have to call in and then ask them to move limits around
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.600]   and then have someone be like, why does this guy have 12 chase cards?
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.220]   Right. Like maybe that's another risk flag versus like by me
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.720]   decreasing the limit, then it's the algorithm approving me.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.860]   And like to me, that's just lower risk.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.680]   OK. OK. So you go chase to Amex, I'm guessing.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.940]   No. So you do chase to Capital One.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.100]   Capital One.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.820]   And then I would say Citibank of America.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.940]   Barclays are all kind of in the same zone.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.240]   U.S. Bank, you'd probably want to kind of do after Capital One.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.900]   But I feel like the value of their cards are not as good
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.860]   unless you're on Team Cashback, like the U.S.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.620]   Bank Altitude Reserve Plus.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.200]   I mean, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   So I think after Capital One, you can make the argument for U.S.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.160]   Bank and then the only card.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.460]   There's not that many cards unless you're in Team Cashback, basically.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.540]   Yeah. And all the ones you mentioned, Bank of America, Barclays, U.S.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.880]   Bank, are they all cash back?
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.120]   Bank of America would be for Alaska points, OK?
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.300]   Because that like is super valuable and they have a lot of first
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.220]   business class options with their partners.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.920]   Yeah, we flew Alaska a lot for a few years.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.260]   We had some status and I collected all these Alaska points
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.480]   and I never want to spend them because I feel like they're the one currency
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.140]   that's like there's just no way to get more Alaska points that I know of.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.760]   Maybe Bonvoy transfer.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.360]   It's not really a good transfer, though, right?
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.020]   It's pretty bad value to transfer.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.440]   But yeah, you could.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.020]   There is a case for Bank of America if you're on Team Cashback,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.660]   if you want to have 100K with their brokerage or something.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.740]   But yeah, that's let's come back to cash back. OK.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.780]   And then and then Amex after, basically.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.460]   Yeah. And any nuance with Amex that that I think would be helpful.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.880]   You generally want to start with the platinum card to the like
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.000]   how they use the platinum offers to entice people to come in.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.040]   So generally speaking, if you're not a customer of them,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.680]   you can get the most value, generally like 125, the 150K as an intro bonus.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.720]   And like they dangle that carrot, because when you're not a customer,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.680]   they want to bring you in.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.100]   But then the moment you become a customer, it becomes a lot harder
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.140]   to get that offer.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.600]   You can still pull it up by using something like card match.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.720]   And like we have a whole blog post on assets.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.140]   I'd be walking through a card match.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.860]   But I think a lot of people just don't realize that they get like
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.820]   they see the gold card and they're like, that card makes a lot of sense for me.
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.540]   And then you get that card and then you potentially lose out on 75K.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.500]   So like 25K in MRF bonus from the platinum that you otherwise could have gotten.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.960]   I just got an email today that 150K on platinum
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.140]   through card match is kind of a very open option.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.000]   Like sometimes it's you're lucky if you get it.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.060]   Right now, it seems pretty pervasive for new customers.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.680]   So I'll find a link to card match for the 150K and I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.940]   Yeah. So 150K tends to be if you're not a customer with them,
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.060]   that's generally the easiest way to get the 150K.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.520]   If you are a customer, you still can get the 150K,
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.940]   but it's just a lot less common.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.240]   Yeah. And sometimes you have to literally wait for the flyers to come in the mail
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.540]   like physical paper.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.500]   And after, how do you think about the strategy of going through Amex
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:58.360]   membership rewards cards or MR as you've been saying or all their airline hotel cards?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.500]   I would do the other cards first just because they have so many other rules around it.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.740]   So there's something called the 4, 5, 6 rule.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.540]   So for their credit cards, you can only have four or five or six of them.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.420]   Their charge card, you can't say charge card anymore.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.300]   Their MR cards don't have that rule.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.060]   So you can actually kind of get as many of them as you want at any time.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.400]   So you generally want to start with the credit cards first,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.320]   because that just makes more sense, like to start those clocks,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.740]   because that's going to be like your bottleneck.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.160]   OK, and that's all the Marriott.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.200]   Delta, Marriott, Hilton. Yeah.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.540]   And I mean, there's other cards.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.500]   I think there's like a Cole, not a Cole's.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.380]   There's like a Lowe's card, but like I haven't gone that one
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.080]   because like that doesn't matter to me, but there's cards.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.660]   Would it be there on your quest to 50?
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.580]   Is there an intro bonus?
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.720]   There is an intro bonus,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.420]   but I don't think it matters for me because I don't shop there.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.380]   But yeah, yeah,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.720]   I got my total toilet at Lowe's, so, you know, there's always value there.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.260]   And then what's after that?
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:56.920]   That's it, right?
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.640]   Is there you circle back to chase or you get into the business game?
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.560]   But I feel like that's it.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.140]   We didn't talk about built at all because as great as I think built points are.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.740]   There's no welcome bonus.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.400]   There's like a secret welcome bonus that exists if you like technically,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.520]   if you sign up and then oftentimes in the first five days
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.700]   to like let you earn up to 50 points.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.500]   Yeah, you get five X points.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.740]   And it's now it's first day announced that it's official
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.700]   and then they announced that it's random and it's not official.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.620]   So I don't want to promise it.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:32.660]   But I think if you want a card to earn three X points on on travel
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.240]   and or three X points on dining, great.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.380]   But if you pay rent, it makes sense.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.160]   I would still put it in the back burner after American Express, though,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.500]   or maybe like at the same time as American Express, the rationale being that
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.260]   the intro bonus, like the multiplier sounds nice on the surface.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.440]   But if you're someone that's a low spender,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.860]   you're better off using that rent to help hit intra bonuses.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.680]   So like if you're someone who doesn't spend that much on everything else,
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   but you're paying New York or Bay Area or anywhere, rent
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.320]   that 500 or 1000 or 2000 and spends like you can earn one X.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.520]   That sounds great.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.780]   But like you're better off just literally hitting a full on intro bonus
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.900]   and paying like maybe 2% fees.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.620]   OK, so you're arguing that because the intro bonus is so big,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.240]   let's use a practical example.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.620]   You get a card spend.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.740]   Let's say you live in New York.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.780]   Your rent is 4K.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.460]   You could easily use that 4K to hit the CSP intra bonus of 60K points.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.960]   Maybe put on the belts are getting 4000 points.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.800]   So you're looking at 60000 points versus 4000 points.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   And the fact that most intro bonuses are repeatable, you're kind of better off
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.100]   like you're better off going down the intro bonus list.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.560]   That makes sense.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.400]   And going for an intro bonus each month, even if you have to pay $80 in fees
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.240]   on one card, you're paying 4000.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   You're getting a 60000 point bonus and spending $80 in fees.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.860]   And on the other, you're spending 4000.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.560]   You're getting 4000 points, but no fees.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.740]   Yeah, because the net amount is positive.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.900]   So like even if you use enough credits to offset the fees you're paying,
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.240]   it just makes financial sense.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.620]   Like the math works out.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.920]   Yeah, it's almost what do you what would you say?
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.780]   Have you done the math?
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:10.220]   What is a average kind of percent back in points or intro bonuses?
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.680]   I'd say for cashback equivalent, probably about 20 to 30%
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.860]   for travel stuff, 30 to like 80%, like Southwest ones.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.440]   Like we've seen some pretty crazy offers there
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   because they also have just like lower minimum spends.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.240]   Oftentimes business tends to be about 11.1%, give or take.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.160]   Yeah. OK, so when you say 2025, you mean it's kind of like
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.500]   if your Amex gold card earns four points per dollar on groceries
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.880]   for the amount of money you spend on the intro bonus,
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.580]   you're earning effectively 25 points per dollar.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.000]   You could say that. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.260]   I mean, it's it's different per card.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.580]   And if you spend money past the intro bonus, it's not the same.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.180]   But the argument for so for dining, I feel like that's
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.140]   it still makes sense that introduces are better, but that's still for X.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.680]   We've built you're only looking at one X.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.940]   So like that, that is a pretty big difference to me.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.400]   OK, I think that makes sense.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.900]   OK, that was a lot.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.400]   I think people have probably been convinced at least to look into
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.780]   the intro bonus game a little bit more if they haven't.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.440]   And what's the cap? How many cards are you at?
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.480]   North of 50.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   But yeah. And no problems.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.440]   Like, do you feel like when you were in that home stretch
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.820]   doing the last from 40 to 50, you were still getting approvals?
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.900]   That's why American Express was towards them.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.700]   So like, I think if you actually map out things properly,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.660]   you can easily do that. It's not a problem in terms of managing.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.780]   I think some people will be like, oh, that's a lot of work.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.420]   You can automate a lot of it using either code or just like building your own stuff.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.120]   Or even if you don't want if you want to keep it very manual,
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.200]   you can set a lot of the dates around the same time.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.080]   So, for example, like all my chase cards close on the first of each month
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.260]   or like almost as close as I could make it to like the end of the month
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.300]   because like everything just closes there.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.040]   And then all my Amex cards like close mid month.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.220]   That way, you can. Why does that matter?
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.640]   Mostly just to make your life simpler.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   Like if you are trying to like, hey, like if someone's like 50 cards,
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.300]   like how do I deal with paying these off?
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.920]   And but you're not using all 50 regularly.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.380]   Yeah, I'm not using all 50, but I'm saying I think just even like if mentally,
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.260]   if like it's weird for you to be like,
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.420]   I don't want to look at my cards every single day of a month,
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.560]   potentially for some weird fraud charge or something.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.020]   It's just easier to like maybe set like one or two dates in a month
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.860]   as like dates that you like even look at stuff.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.560]   But yeah, I don't you don't need to use most of the cards.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.980]   I just link all my cards to I use Copilot, but you can use any other tool,
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.400]   link all your cards, you'll see all the transactions come up.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.880]   So, you know, I don't I don't think I've reviewed my transactions
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.420]   on the card issuer sites for a while.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.800]   Yeah. So I think that also works if you have like an aggregator.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.720]   But yeah, for the most part, you don't really.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.300]   I think it's a lot less stressful than you think it is.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.480]   I think if you're coming from zero cards or like three cards to 50,
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.760]   that sounds very intense.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.800]   But if you're someone who's already at like eight to 10,
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.600]   it's you're used to it.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.480]   Like at this point, it's like going to the gym, like, oh, cool. Yeah.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.360]   And so 50 cards, that's easily.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.960]   I've got to assume at least 75,000 points per bonus, give or take.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.120]   Yeah. And I think to be fair, a lot of the bonuses were easier
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.460]   to get back in the day as well.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.840]   Like Bank of America was substantially more lax with their bonuses
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.720]   and like how many cards you could get. Yeah.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.640]   OK. Any any other things to keep in mind,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.820]   especially on Amex, when it comes to how many times you can get a bonus?
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.220]   So it's technically once in a lifetime.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.860]   I think there are some like a form
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.020]   inkling saying that maybe it's like once every 10 years.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.780]   But like, I just don't want to rely on an exception.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:42.480]   Yeah, for most people, I would lean towards American Express
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.460]   towards the end, unless, you know, that you don't want to get that many cards
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.740]   because not everyone does or you're just a very high spender.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.080]   Like if you are somewhat if you're a food reviewer in New York
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.160]   and you spend like 10K a month, then yeah, the gold card probably works out for you.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.840]   Yeah. And and so we said we would talk about cash back briefly.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.100]   If someone's thinking, this is great, I want to earn a lot of value.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.600]   I want to open cards.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.540]   But when it comes to using my points, I just find that I don't get the value I want.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:15.300]   And if you're ending up using your points to just book in the travel portal
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.840]   on Amex or Citi, is it even worth playing the points game
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.180]   or is it worth considering cash back cards?
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.420]   I think you still can go for intro bonuses because that's still
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.480]   it's the same math that drives the needle the most set up wise.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.020]   You might be looking at different cards.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.600]   So I think Chase still kind of works pretty well for cash back.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   Bank of America is another consideration now because they have like
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   these really good cards that you like earn up to five point
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.780]   two five percent on a lot of transactions and like two point two six.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.400]   I think on like six to five.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.900]   Yeah. Two point six to five on everything else. Yeah.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.280]   So I think there is a play for that,
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.620]   especially if you just want something super simple.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.780]   And I think a lot of people get pissed off because they're like, wait,
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.820]   I only get zero point six cents in value for my points.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.680]   And that's not very good.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.000]   You can get the Schwab card in order to get like one point one cents.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.300]   So that's a bit better.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.520]   But the Schwab Platinum.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.640]   But then at the same time, you're like, well, if you don't.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.180]   If you're someone that's focused on cash back, you tend not to travel,
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:21.100]   in which case the Platinum card becomes a lot harder to like recommend and use.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.320]   So it's that weird dilemma where you're like,
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.020]   technically, a Platinum card might make financial sense because I spend so much
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.660]   and that increases my earn rate, but I don't travel.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.620]   So this card is not useful other than for that earn rate bonus.
[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.840]   Yeah, I think if you want to earn points and you want to use them
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.680]   without having to go to the hassle of transferring,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.580]   Chase is probably going to be best.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.300]   Cap one city.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.720]   Cap one, I think it's really tough because you only get zero point
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.920]   five cents per point unless you use like the saver.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.340]   But the Venture X kind of becomes like out of the equation.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.840]   OK, even if you're bringing in their portal.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.220]   If you book through their portal, then you.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.140]   If you're doing some form of travel, then you actually have one side, sorry.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.600]   But if you're like purely, purely cashback, then I would say capital one.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.220]   Other than the saver, a safer one would not be on my list.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.280]   City's also not bad.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:08.480]   Portal's still only one cent, but you can also cash out at one cent per point,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.060]   which is pretty nice.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.600]   OK, and then for people, we talked about rent, right?
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.020]   One way that you could hit these intro bonuses because some of them,
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.560]   you know, spend a few thousand dollars if you don't have that spend
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.080]   or if you want to do it, do a lot of them, even run some in tandem.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.120]   You know, you could just pay fees.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.960]   Are there other ways you've seen people get successful?
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.000]   Are there other good ways to.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.540]   Kind of increase your spend to hit these bonuses
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.120]   without necessarily adding to your expenses for the year?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.660]   Yeah, I think you can speak to this pretty well.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.120]   If you're the group trip planner, that works out very well,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.140]   especially if you have like more wealthy friends for like a bachelor party
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:47.920]   or something.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.600]   If everyone's paying you a ton of money and then you're booking up hotels,
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.260]   meals are obviously another one.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.600]   I think a lot of people also end up starting businesses
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.400]   as a means of earning more points and then eventually, ironically,
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.020]   that ends up becoming like a profit center and say, oh, I can make a lot of money
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:03.520]   here.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.740]   So I've seen people like flip things or like more do more like drop shipping
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.240]   style stuff where you can get a lot of points and also get money.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.080]   Like I run into people who are like, yeah, I run 100K in ads.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.740]   I like make a crap ton of money.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.380]   But it's like I started this because I was trying to figure out
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.500]   how to get more points.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.540]   Yeah, I met someone recently who I think he said makes
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.200]   spent $4 million a month for his business on.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.620]   I can't remember which Amex it was.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.920]   I would be so sad if it was like a platinum card
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.960]   because he could just be earning twice as much.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.300]   But at that point, I'm like, if you're earning four million, four million.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.100]   Yeah, I was going to say I was going to guess the business gold for ads,
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.140]   but then it's all formulas a lot. That's a lot.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.220]   Yeah, I guess Amex might be the only card that would give you a limit to do that.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:49.680]   Capital One Venture X business is also like a charge card where it's uncapped.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.100]   OK, yeah.
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.280]   And two weeks back and everything.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.400]   I know that's what that's what this person should have.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.560]   That's why I think it's like the best new card right now
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.660]   or like the best business card, arguably the same with the Sparkash Plus.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.080]   Yeah, Sparkash Plus had the best intro bonus.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.400]   When I got it, it was 250,000.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.160]   But it's just the fact that it's uncapped because like Amex,
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.540]   unless you're doing like five K plus purchases,
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.740]   then you get one point five X on the platinum business.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.460]   But like everything else is like capped off, like the blue business.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.920]   Plus, that's only 50 K.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.460]   Like you're going to burn through that.
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.720]   Yeah, if you're a high spender, Amex doesn't have a great everything card.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.380]   OK, so we talked a lot about earning points.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.140]   We talked a lot about what's coming.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.060]   Let's talk a little bit about how do we how we use them.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:34.320]   We I think the two of us have gotten a chance to do a lot of exciting
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.440]   international, maybe some domestic kind of these aspirational trips.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.540]   If people are sitting on points and thinking,
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.620]   what are some amazing ways to use them, what are some of your favorites
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.460]   and your highlights, whether it's airline cabins, destinations
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.620]   or specific properties?
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.800]   I think if you have a player to you should probably ask them where they want to go.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.040]   That's a good starting point,
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.720]   because for a lot of people, that's how they actually convert
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.840]   their partner to get into credit cards, because they're like,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.140]   why are you focused on these points?
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.140]   This sounds dumb.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.840]   But when you take them to the place they want to go, they're like,
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.760]   oh, this is really nice.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.520]   Wow. Why were we flying economy before when we can fly business?
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.200]   I think in terms of I lean more towards hotel still in terms of value,
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.160]   because I think you get so much more time there.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.120]   And also you can have two people.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.040]   Flights are fun, but they feel so much more finite.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.880]   I think Bora Bora Maldives are obviously the go to ones.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.960]   And I think some people argue it's a bit overrated as someone
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.720]   that likes to snorkel and like enjoy the water.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.340]   I really like it.
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.760]   And I think the fact that I can check it off the bucket list is fun as well.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.880]   Yeah. No Seychelles yet.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.020]   That's on the list for 2024.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.060]   OK, yeah. Yeah.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.760]   There's the new the new Waldorf.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.940]   Oh, we did two Hilton's there.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.360]   I don't know if they're both still there.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.100]   Yeah, I think we were looking to that initially.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.860]   And then when we heard that the water was opening 2024, I was like,
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.280]   oh, OK, let's just do that instead.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.360]   Yeah. Some of those aspirational stays have been great.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.000]   But even domestically, I feel like you've been done Ventana,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.240]   which is one of the best values of high points out there,
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   despite being a lot of high points.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.000]   Yeah, I think that one's an interesting one.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.920]   It's not for everyone like I've heard.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.500]   You either love it or you hate it.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.540]   So I like it because it's a means for me to like reconnect with environment
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.720]   and kind of like get away from everything as someone who's like
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.960]   constantly connected to like technology.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.840]   So as someone like I grew up like camping and doing a lot of that stuff.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.100]   So it was the closest I could get to that while still keeping Mandy happy
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.900]   because Mandy just does not like outdoors stuff for whatever reason.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.440]   She's also sitting there right now.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.820]   So, yeah, I think that was like the closest she got to glamping,
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.660]   which is kind of funny and also sad.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.360]   Yeah, I I've been there for a wedding and we were too cheap
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.120]   to book a room at the wedding rate and there was nothing with points.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.620]   So we booked over like a room at a hotel down the street.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.240]   And I have not been back yet.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.160]   Yeah, I think it's nice.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   It's probably worth at least like one weekend.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.580]   It's just a nice little escape.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.040]   That's nearby. Yeah.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.620]   So we hit the most obvious spots.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:04.960]   Are there a few properties that aren't quite as wild as,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.800]   you know, these honeymoon destinations
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.180]   that you think are interesting spots to check out around the world
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.260]   or even domestically?
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.180]   So not really a points one, but you can use points to like it.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.720]   They're booking through portals.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.480]   Faroe Islands is like still our favorite vacation
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.760]   that like we pretty much paid out of pocket for.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.820]   So it's like this little islands that is owned by Denmark, I believe.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.320]   That's like between like London,
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.820]   Iceland and like.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.700]   Yeah, like basically up there.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.820]   It's like a tiny islands.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.620]   They have these puffins there. It's beautiful.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.420]   That's kind of what you imagine Iceland to be, but like even nicer
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.160]   in a lot of ways, just super picturesque. Awesome.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.580]   OK, then last, what have been your top airline cabin experiences?
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.740]   If someone's like I'm saving some points up
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.420]   and I just want to have a wild experience in the sky,
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.760]   where do you think your points can take you right now?
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.880]   Because I know a lot of the past, like getting Emirates first
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.500]   used to be a little bit more accessible.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.100]   Fees can get pretty high.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.600]   What do you think is the best bang?
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.020]   The best bang for buck would probably be A&A,
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:11.180]   given just the ways you can book it and like the value of the cabin
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.940]   and also the fact that it's like one of the best first and also business class.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.320]   If anything, it's the best business class cabin right now.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   So I think that's like where the value is.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.280]   I think in terms of like crazy experience,
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.240]   I mean, Etihad first apartments is still nice.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.120]   I don't like their soft product.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.500]   They were kind of mean, but it's fine.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.460]   But the hard product is nice.
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.120]   It's like very big.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.700]   And where can you get what's the way to get Etihad?
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.160]   Etihad, you could book through American.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.120]   Americans, probably the best way.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.680]   OK, or you can book through, I think, their points,
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.680]   but it might not be that advantageous.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.340]   They used to have a lot of more routes.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.640]   But then since the shutdowns and stuff, the routes only recently opened back up.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.020]   So I think London to Abu Dhabi or is it France?
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.640]   The Abu Dhabi is the main one right now that has the new cabin. OK.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.060]   And so American points pretty hard to get.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:05.580]   Is it just is your stash of American points, just American cards,
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.800]   or how did you build up an American balance enough to do it?
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.500]   It's mostly American cards and like we don't have that many anymore.
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.880]   So sometimes we actually even like buy it if the math makes sense.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.940]   So they'll have like promotions where they'll be like,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.760]   we'll give you an extra 40% points.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.060]   So for us, I'm like, OK, cool.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.740]   So that means I can book first class for about like twenty two hundred dollars.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.400]   I'm like, that still makes sense.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.700]   So like, I think there is a stage where if you're comfortable,
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.120]   especially for like reviewing stuff, there is a case of buying points
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.460]   because like at a certain point you do run out of points.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.660]   Yeah, I actually I watched someone do the math on Wyndham points.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.960]   And so Wyndham points using the book of a Casa, you can get some good deals.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.180]   But at times, and I think recently there was one of those times
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.600]   where you could book Wyndham points for less than a penny a point.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.760]   And so to transfer your points to Wyndham was actually a worse deal
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.100]   than to redeem them for statement credits and just buy the Wyndham points.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.360]   Yeah. Same thing with IG, where like their points are terrible value wise.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.700]   And like there's almost no use case.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.280]   We're getting at least one time per point.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.000]   So you're better off either just booking through the portal
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.080]   or just like cashing it out.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.380]   But that's also why I'm kind of like wanting to switch from Delta,
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.040]   because I have a lot of business spent anyways.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.840]   And I'm going towards status.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.420]   I'm like, do I like for my end result, do I want to have,
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:23.600]   let's say, 200000 Delta miles or do I want 200000 American?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.200]   And American has so much more value while I'm sitting on like one point two.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.540]   I'm sitting on an astronomical amount of Delta miles
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.340]   because I haven't had a good use case.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.040]   Like I've been waiting for Delta flash sales to come back and they just did.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   But like other than that, like I don't want to spend 400K
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.000]   for a business class one way flight.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.140]   So if someone's listening and they have half a million Delta points,
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.340]   how do you use Delta points to get good value?
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.520]   It's either Delta flash sales or kind of treating them like cash
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.940]   and like Southwest miles where you like get fixed value.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.280]   And if you're fine with that, that's great.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   Like for cashback focused or like economy travel, it's not bad.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.740]   But like if you're looking for outsized value, it's tough.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.200]   Is there ever a way that you'd find?
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.040]   I remember we took our honeymoon to the Seychelles
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.540]   and it was 120000 Delta points on Air France partner awards on Delta.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   Are there deals ever to be had?
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.760]   So there used to be a lot more and it was a lot easier back in the day
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.260]   of partner awards, and it's not really the case anymore.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.720]   So Delta flash sales is like the main thing
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.980]   that they discontinued for like three years during the shutdowns.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.140]   And it just brought back in August.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.060]   That's generally when they have either Delta or partner flights
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:33.020]   that just have a lot of availability that like people aren't flying.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.980]   So they end up having a sale for it.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.320]   And it's better value. Yeah.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.240]   I've been getting a lot of value from Delta points on just short domestic flights.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.040]   But it's it's like fixed value.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.500]   Like for that, you're getting like one point three to one point five.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.080]   Like you're not getting crazy value.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.200]   You close to two cent values on Delta
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.180]   to Mexico booking on Delta through Aeromexico.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:01.480]   And it was actually like a two, two and a half cent value, even in business.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.680]   So there is also another trick that I think I haven't talked a lot about
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.360]   because I wasn't sure if it was a good idea.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.060]   But if you actually don't fly from the U.S., if you leave from Mexico,
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:15.360]   you can still get good value from business class on Delta, on Delta
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.780]   and through partners.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.700]   So like if you flew to like Mexico City to fly some other airline,
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:25.600]   it's like Korea or something, then it's not going to cost you 400,000.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.740]   It's about only cost you like 100,000 points.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:31.580]   OK, so if you live in Texas, it might be a good deal.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.540]   Get to Mexico City and go.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.460]   If you live on the West Coast and have kids, it might sound like them.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.880]   Yeah, I don't think I would do that if you had kids.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.260]   Yeah, it's not on the table.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:41.920]   Awesome.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.720]   Any any other cool deals, hacks like that,
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.220]   you know, in the miles world that you want to share before we take off?
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.740]   Um, nothing I can think of too much right now.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.460]   Yeah, I think for the most part, that's it.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.540]   This is so awesome.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.880]   If you want any links to any of the cards we talked about,
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.580]   you can go to all the hacks dot com slash cards, except a few.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.880]   Sebastian, let people know where to find those and everything else you're working
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.060]   on for city cards or for other cards where you want to run the numbers
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.020]   and play off the calculator.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.220]   We have that on AskSebi.com.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.600]   You can find me on YouTube and AskSebi and then AskSebi Business.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.780]   Yep. We'll link to everything in the show notes.
