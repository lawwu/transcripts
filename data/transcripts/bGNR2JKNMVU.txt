[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   My mission with Journey Mexico was to share the beyond the beach destinations. And we've seen a
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.000]   lot more focus on a lot of the more cultural, more off the beaten path, more remote destinations.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.360]   But I always wondered why people had never been to Mexico City or people had never been to Oaxaca,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.040]   people hadn't been to Chiapas or the Yucatan Peninsula like Merida, the Haciendas, Campeche.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.800]   These are all incredibly culturally, historically rich destinations that people often hadn't heard
