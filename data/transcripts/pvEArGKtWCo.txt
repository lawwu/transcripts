[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   How hard is money laundering?
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.080]   If you want to look at probably the most sophisticated money laundering in history, he's currently a guest of the U.S.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.920]   government. But wherever SBF is staying, he was eventually caught.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.200]   He was not caught for laundering tens of billions of dollars round.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200]   He wasn't even under suspicion for laundering tens of billions of dollars round.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.640]   There's many other ways to launder money.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:28.120]   You can do things like say I establish a shell corporation and I buy a piece of real estate in New York City and then I rent that real estate out to people and I collect a stream of rents from that to a totally legitimate person.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   This money is clean and the money that I like put into the system to buy this on behalf of the shell corporation, I'm just going to like wire it to a lawyer and the lawyer is going to answer any question from the bank with I don't know where it came from.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.560]   I don't have to tell you I'm a lawyer.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.600]   It's a real estate transaction.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.120]   What do you want for me? In one sense, that's money laundering.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   If the original money was the proceeds of crime.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.320]   In another sense, that's how every real estate transaction goes down at those scales.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.240]   I think I would be really good at money laundering.
