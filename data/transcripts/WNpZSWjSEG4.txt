[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Ryland, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this, "Do we need to be listening for God's
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120]   voice to speak to us outside of the Bible?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.660]   Does He desire to speak to us audibly like He does to certain people in the Bible?
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.280]   And if so, Pastor John, how do we know if it's God's voice we're hearing?"
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.840]   I really want to say something positive here and not just negative.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.480]   In fact, most of what I have to say is positive.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.880]   And the first and main thing is to say, "God really has spoken."
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.960]   And this word is living and active.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   It's not a dead word.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.960]   He really speaks today through the inspired scriptures.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.540]   He really, really does, Ryland.
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.200]   He really does.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.300]   Not just with information, but with Himself, by His Spirit.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.740]   First Samuel 3:21, "The Lord appeared at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel at
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.020]   Shiloh by the word of the Lord."
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020]   That really happens.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:25.360]   God stands forth from His inspired word as we read it prayerfully and dependently.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.120]   And I would add this, that word in the Bible is more sure than anything you can hear outside
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   the Bible.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.660]   I base that on 1 Corinthians 14, 37.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.420]   If anyone thinks he's a prophet or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.940]   writing to you are a command of the Lord.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.420]   If anyone does not recognize this, he's not recognized.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.420]   That's amazing.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.680]   Paul is saying, "You can call yourself a prophet and get messages from God.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.220]   You can call yourself spiritual and be tuned in to God.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.060]   But if anything you say doesn't accord with what I say, you're not recognized."
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:20.100]   Which means that outside the Bible, we have fallible, uncertain impressions and messages.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.720]   Inside the Bible, we have rock-solid, dependable messages.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.620]   So there are treasures and wonders and glories and dimensions of God to be seen in the Bible
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.340]   that we have scarcely seen.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.340]   It seems to me to be folly to crave the lesser authority and the lesser riches outside the
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.540]   Bible than the riches and the greater authority that we've barely tasted, let alone digested,
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180]   inside the Bible.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.820]   Now, having said that positive thing about the Bible that I love, I just love the Bible
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.220]   so much and I know that after, what, 60 years of reading my Bible, I've barely scratched
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.980]   the surface of glories.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.620]   So I kind of get ticked, frankly, at myself and others who are craving stuff outside the
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.600]   Bible as though there's something better to be had out there.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.260]   Having said all that, I don't see anything in the Bible that would say God can't communicate
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.700]   with us in extraordinary ways outside the Bible.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.280]   He can.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:42.380]   And if He does, we should test it by His infinitely authoritative written Word, and we should
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.740]   commend it to those whose lives show a deep, long wisdom in Christ.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.180]   There's this community dimension to testing all things.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.460]   Like Paul said, "Don't despise prophecies.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.900]   Test all things.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   Hold fast to what is good."
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   That's just not a private thing.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.260]   That's something we do with others as well.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.980]   But I'll close with this.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.820]   Beware, Ryland.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.620]   Beware of craving the sensations of a voice.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.340]   Jesus warned against those who seek a sign.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.500]   So here He is.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.900]   He's standing there in front of the Pharisees and scribes, speaking.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.020]   And they say, "Give us a sign."
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.020]   What does that mean?
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.220]   It means that the voice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, wasn't adequate.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.740]   They needed something more.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.700]   They needed to feel more, touch more, see more.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.020]   They wanted more, and Jesus wouldn't give it to them.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.540]   And I think we're in a situation today not unlike that.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:05.100]   We hear more of the Son of God than anybody in Jesus' day ever heard, because we have
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.460]   all four Gospels, and those people got it in snatches.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.660]   Therefore, we have the wholeness of the revelation that Jesus meant to communicate, and it's
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.700]   speaking to us every time we read the Bible.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.460]   And if we turn away from that and say, "But I need a sign.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.460]   I need a sign.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460]   I need a voice.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.300]   I need a tree to fall down in the woods when I'm talking.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.020]   I need something."
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.900]   We're putting ourselves in the position of those who demanded a sign.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.140]   Instead, I think our heart should be, "Oh God."
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.700]   This is the way Paul taught the Ephesians to pray in chapter 1, verse 17.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.740]   "Give my heart's eyes sight.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.100]   Open my eyes to your power.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.780]   Open my eyes to your wisdom.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.660]   Open my eyes to your inheritance.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.220]   You say stunning things that should blow me away, and give me a sense of your worth beyond
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.660]   anything any message outside should give.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.980]   So Father, if I'm not seeing, if I'm not hearing, have mercy upon me and open my eyes."
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.140]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.700]   And on a related note, see Pastor John's article, "The Morning I Heard the Voice of God," which
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.620]   was published back on March 21st of 2007.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.460]   A provocative title and a provocative thought.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.980]   You can find it at desiringgod.org, along with thousands of free books, articles, sermons,
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.180]   and other resources from John Piper.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.180]   We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.300]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
