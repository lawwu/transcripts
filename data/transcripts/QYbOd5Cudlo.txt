[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   [Music]
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.820]   We have an email from a young man, Stephen, who is currently enrolled in the very fine institution called
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.580]   Bethlehem College and Seminary. Stephen writes in to ask this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.100]   I was born and raised in Minneapolis, and I happen to be an African-American.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.180]   I am convinced that all believers should view the Bible with Reformed eyes.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.920]   No race is disqualified from enjoying the goodness of the gospel with a Reformed mindset.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.600]   So why do you think that black people like myself are few in Reformed circles?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.320]   I'm not bitter, nor do I question God. I'm just curious how you view this phenomenon."
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.360]   Well, I view that question with a lot of thankfulness,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.720]   because anybody who, number one, cares about the issue of racial
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   harmony and cares about biblical doctrine and who's not bitter and who's not questioning God, what a great
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.720]   combination. So, praise God, and I'm thankful.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.300]   This is risky to talk about. Anything to do with race is risky,
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.880]   but
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.720]   this one especially, because it's so easy in answering a question like this to fall into stereotypes
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.180]   in both directions, white or black or any other ethnicity.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.840]   But I settled it a long time ago, and I would invite other folks to do the same.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.760]   I settled it a long time ago
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   that the risks of
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.760]   wrestling with these issues out loud for others to hear are more hopeful
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.320]   than the risks of keeping your mouth shut forever
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   about these issues and supposedly playing it safe.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.600]   That's what a lot of pastors do and a lot of leaders, a lot of people that just don't want to get attacked,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.120]   and so they don't say anything, which I think in the long run is less helpful.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.880]   So, my first response to the question is to say I'm not the only or the best
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.560]   person to address the issue.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800]   It's being talked about
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.520]   regularly these days. There are great discussions at, for example, the Gospel Coalition
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.160]   website. I just watched a panel with Trip Lee and Lecrae and Eric Mason just a few days ago on this very issue,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   and it was helpful.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.600]   Books have been written about this issue by Anthony Carter, Thabiti Anyabwile, Carl Ellis.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.480]   Good books, solid, helpful books about what that's like for the Reformed tradition to emerge or flourish in the black
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.620]   setting. So, I would just say seek out, whoever's listening, seek out
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.160]   African-American brothers who have thought this through and are working it through every day
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760]   about what it's like to
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   function in
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.800]   Reformed circles or embrace Reformed theology. So, here are my four answers to the question.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.920]   I did have four specific answers to the question, all of which, no doubt, are going to need
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.480]   nuancing
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.000]   by people with sharper eyes than mine, and here's the way I'm putting the question. It's a little different.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.440]   It gets at the same thing, but I'll tell you why I'm shifting it. I'm going to say, "Why are
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.120]   there not more blacks embracing Reformed theology?"
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.720]   And I choose to ask the question that way instead of saying, "Why so few?"
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.960]   Because I think there are more than we think, and it skews the question to put it like we know there are few, really.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.760]   Comparatively speaking, I'm not so sure of that.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.240]   So, just say, "Why not more?"
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.000]   And I choose to say, "Why not more embracing Reformed theology rather than functioning in Reformed circles?" Because circles are a little bit
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.200]   unclear to me, and I don't want to replace a theological
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   conviction with a sociological place.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   So, that's the reason for my asking my question, "Why are there not more blacks embracing
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.600]   Reformed theology?" And here are myâ€”and before I give my answers,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.920]   we really need to say, you know, it's just as interesting a question to ask, "Why aren't more whites embracing Reformed theology?"
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.200]   And why aren't there more Asians? And really the most important question, "Why aren't there more humans
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.360]   embracing Reformed theology?" Okay, but that's not what he asked, so I'll go to his question. Number one, in history,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.200]   blacks were excluded from white churches where Reformed theology was articulated, as
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.440]   they were from virtually every other kind of white church. This is to our shame.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.320]   It's not news.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.240]   Why it happened is a huge issue for another time, but it is utterly
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.920]   relevant to the question. You can't exclude a whole people
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.440]   from the rigors of weakly Reformed preaching and expect the doctrines to flourish, at least not in the same way
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.120]   they might if seeds of truth are watered every week in that kind of church. That's number one. Number two, in
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440]   history, blacks were excluded from equal
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.080]   formal education,
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.440]   especially at the higher levels where systems of thought are
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   discussed and refined.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   Reformed theology, in its historic fullness, is a synthesis of biblical truth, and
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.280]   the work of synthesis assumes an enormous
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   wealth of knowledge that is passed along certain serious educational lines.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.480]   These lines produce teachers and preachers who then spread the synthesis by speaking and
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   writing for subgroups they represent, and if blacks are
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.240]   excluded from this long
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   tradition, then it will not surprise us that leaders will emerge in their churches,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.160]   where they're allowed to go,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.960]   along different routes and with different approaches to the Bible.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.920]   But here's where I want to stick in a
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:28.440]   caution not to overstate the absence of Reformed theology in the black tradition. If you change the
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.080]   angle on your lens and
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   start seeing crucial truths of Reformed theology, apart from the systematic structure and
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.320]   terminology,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   one could argue that the central lines of Reformed theology were
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   pervasive in the Christian black tradition in America. Just take the sovereignty of God, for example.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.360]   The preaching and the singing of
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   black slaves and post-Civil War black churches
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.800]   virtually never
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.280]   questioned God in the miseries of their lives. It is amazing.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   Egypt was horrible.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.680]   Suffering was pervasive.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.560]   Slavery was unthinkable. Whites were culpable, but God,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:29.200]   He was the deliverer, and He was never portrayed as helpless, like "Where was God while we were in chains?"
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.320]   No, but you don't ever find a spiritual that sings like that.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.160]   The spirituals are shot through with the sovereign Lord of history.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:45.480]   Carl Ellis has just an incredibly helpful take on this in his book "Free at Last," where he describes the kind of preaching and
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.840]   theologizing that distinguished white and black churches in this history where blacks were not welcome in classical academies.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.360]   He said, "White preaching is like playing classical music,
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.040]   meaning the score is
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.080]   written on
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.800]   paper and the notes are there and the preaching happens by following the score. In black preaching,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.480]   it's like jazz, not classical music, like jazz, and a huge part of jazz is
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.240]   improvisation. Now, when both are done well,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   great skill is required, very different skills. And the point here is that the kind of preaching and
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.400]   theologizing that grew up outside
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.040]   the academies
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.080]   would not have the same classical forms, but may indeed have profound
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.120]   reform convictions at root.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:47.720]   Number three, for hundreds of years, the burden of people's attention is on their survival.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:56.040]   They will not have the privilege of relative comfort and leisure granted to the dominant culture, and a lot of
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.600]   systematic doctrinal reflection
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   requires
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.200]   that kind of freedom from press of survival urgencies. And only in recent times,
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.240]   I'm talking
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.400]   60-80 years, only in recent times
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   have the doors opened for blacks to do the kind of work that doesn't demand the sweat of their faces from dawn to dusk
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.600]   with evenings needed for recovery, not rigorous theological reflection.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.120]   Lastly,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.080]   and I'm sure there are a lot more than these, but these are the four that came to my mind,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.360]   I would mention that one reason today there aren't more blacks embracing
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.920]   Reform Theology, though there may be vastly more than we think, is that the current
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.600]   Reformed awakening, say the last 50 years,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.960]   starting with the Banner of Truth, Puritan reprints, Martin Lloyd-Jones, J.I. Packer, that awakening has
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:02.920]   flourished first among white Westerners, which means that it has spread around the world and
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.720]   encounters
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.200]   obstacles.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.640]   What has to be overcome is that when a young black man
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:19.120]   considers this truth, he has to overcome the fact that for him it may look intrinsically white.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.280]   Then it
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   follows
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.120]   that he's not going to be real quick to jump on board.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.600]   Some of the black brothers who are persuaded
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.240]   by the Bible, not because any white man said any particular thing,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.440]   they look to some in their community like they're sucking up to the white
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.080]   establishment, and it takes a lot of courage and
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.760]   assurance of who you are in Christ and in the Bible to stand in that situation.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.600]   So those are my four reasons for why I think more blacks aren't
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.560]   embracing Reformed Theology, and I think it would be more fruitful and
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.680]   encouraging to ask the question,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   "How do we explain the incredible growth of
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.440]   black and Reformed?"
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.000]   But others would do a far better job with that than I, and that wasn't the question that was asked.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.320]   Wonderful. Thank you, Pastor John. I appreciate your willingness to tread here, and
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.200]   we're gonna break for the weekend now,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.440]   but we will return on Monday to address a question haunting a listener about why God would threaten judgment for anyone who fails to
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.000]   delight in Him.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   Doesn't that sound inhumane and maybe a little bit manipulative? I'll ask Pastor John to address that on Monday.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.760]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you then and thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
