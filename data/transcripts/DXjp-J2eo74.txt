[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   [silence]
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.680]   The serotonin 2A receptors are located
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.320]   in multiple brain regions,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.480]   but they have a tremendous amount of expression
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.000]   in the so-called neocortex,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360]   the outside of the brain that includes things
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.520]   like our prefrontal cortex,
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.280]   which is involved in understanding context, right?
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.440]   Which behaviors, thoughts, and speech patterns
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.920]   are appropriate for certain circumstances,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.680]   how to switch context and category switch
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.040]   when you go from, you know, playing sports
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.840]   to hang out with friends to being in a professional setting,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840]   you change your behavior and the way that you speak
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.400]   and perhaps even the way that you think.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.640]   You might think some things that are out of context,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.280]   but you probably keep those to yourself,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.000]   and your ability to keep those to yourself
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.560]   are dependent on a functional prefrontal cortex.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   There are a lot of 5HT2A,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.440]   and by the way, 5HT is the abbreviation for serotonin,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.360]   so there are a lot of serotonin 2A receptors
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.720]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.960]   Also in other areas of the cortex
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.120]   that are associated with sensation and perception,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   that is hearing of sounds,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.960]   that is seeing of particular things,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.960]   and in particular, there is a very, very, very high expression
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.720]   of serotonin 2A receptors in the visual cortex.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.240]   And that is one of the reasons
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320]   why psilocybin triggers visual hallucinations.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.360]   And provided psilocybin is present
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   at sufficient enough concentration,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.600]   that is taken at a sufficient dosage,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.320]   one will experience profound visual hallucinations
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   regardless of whether or not their eyes are open
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.520]   or their eyes are closed.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.680]   Now, that's an important fact
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.240]   because it explains one of the major effects of psilocybin
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.720]   that people experience while they are on the drug.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.180]   Now, as I'll talk about a little bit later
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.320]   in terms of what constitutes a useful psilocybin session,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.160]   useful meaning that it's leading
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.680]   to adaptive improvements in mood,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480]   adaptive improvements in creativity and cognition, et cetera,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.520]   is that people not have their eyes open
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   for at least the majority of the psilocybin session.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.760]   This is something I've discussed with several experts
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.180]   who are running clinical studies
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.860]   on psilocybin in their laboratories,
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.040]   some of whom are going to be guests
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.960]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast in upcoming episodes.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.160]   Again, I can't underscore this enough.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.820]   Because your visual cortex contains so many
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.760]   of these serotonin 2A receptors,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   and because psilocybin binds so strongly
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.680]   to that serotonin 2A receptor,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.160]   you're going to experience a lot of visual hallucinations
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.120]   when you are under the influence of psilocybin.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   There's no surprise there.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.040]   This has been known for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.120]   It's one of the main reasons why people take psilocybin.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   However, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.160]   these hallucinations occur even when the eyes are closed.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   And it's now fairly well-established
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.040]   that if people are to take psilocybin
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.360]   and have their eyes open, much of their cognition,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.800]   much of their thinking, much of the time spent
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   in that psilocybin journey is focused
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400]   on the altered perceptions of things
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.960]   in the outside environment.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.740]   Sometimes this looks like a sort of a fracturing
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.920]   of the outside world into kind of geometric shapes.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080]   Sometimes it appears as a kind of melting
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.280]   of things in the visual environment,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.480]   including people's faces or a morphing of people's faces.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.920]   All of that has a strong, let's just call it a draw
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.160]   for a lot of people who are looking
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.120]   for a highly unusual experience
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.160]   inside of the psilocybin journey.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   But I think if one's goal is to derive
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.920]   the long-lasting benefit from the psilocybin experience,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.080]   it's very clear that having an eye mask
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.360]   or some other eye covering or something that ensures
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.600]   that one's eyes are closed for the majority,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   if not the entire psilocybin session,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.880]   is going to be very useful because it's going
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.960]   to limit the extent to which one is focused
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600]   on those outside changes in visual perception,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.280]   aka hallucinations, and rather will allow the person
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.840]   to go inward to combine whatever it is
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   that they happen to be seeing in their mind's eye
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.080]   with the different thoughts and memories
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.840]   and changes in their emotions that are occurring.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.520]   And that going inward by staying in the eye mask,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   at least for the majority of the time,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.040]   seems to be a very, if not the, critical feature
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.600]   of making the psilocybin journey effective
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.020]   in the therapeutic sense.
