[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Welcome back to the podcast on this holiday week
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960]   here in the States.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.760]   Well, we go to school to learn.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.000]   And when it comes to prayer,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   we sometimes need to be enrolled in the school of prayer,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.920]   God's school of prayer.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.440]   And that school of prayer is described for us
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.760]   in the Old Testament in a book we don't go to very often.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.940]   It's the book of Zechariah.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.720]   It's there that we find a key text
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.240]   in John Piper's understanding of how we learn to pray.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.760]   Zechariah 13 verses eight and nine,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.960]   a text never mentioned on this podcast until today.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.880]   Here he is to explain the importance of this text
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.560]   is John Piper in a sermon he preached to his church
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.000]   in the final days of 2008,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.740]   looking ahead to the new year of 2009.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.700]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.220]   - Okay, Zechariah.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.760]   You know where that book is?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760]   Second from the last book of the Old Testament.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.960]   If you go to the end of the Old Testament
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.880]   and flip back about four pages, you'll be there.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.440]   Zechariah chapter 13 verses eight and nine.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   And we'll wrap it up here with this.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.400]   What did I get hit with in Zechariah
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   that gave this message the twist it's now getting?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.280]   On prayer.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.360]   I don't think I'd ever seen this before.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560]   (sighs)
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   This is a couple of verses about God's school of prayer.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.160]   If you're not praying the way you should,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.400]   then probably he's gonna sign you up for this.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600]   So let's start at verse eight.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.320]   In the whole land, declares the Lord,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.160]   two thirds shall be cut off and perish,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.200]   and one third shall be left alive.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.160]   So stop there.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.640]   Don't worry about when this happens in history right now.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.020]   Just leave that one aside.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.400]   Just look at how God works.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   So he takes the whole and two thirds of them perish.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.840]   They get wiped out.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.340]   And God saves a third.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.720]   So you're in that third if you're a Christian.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.920]   Just symbolically, you're in that third.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.320]   So you're in that third.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   God's remnant, faithful, imperfect, weak, lousy prayers.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.800]   He saved them.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.660]   What's God's remedy for their weaknesses?
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.000]   Verse nine.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.040]   What's his school of prayer?
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.320]   Verse nine.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.160]   And I will put this third into the fire
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.320]   and refine them as one refines silver
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.200]   and test them as gold is tested.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.920]   So now notice carefully what's happening
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.840]   'cause this is surprising.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   In his great love, he rescues them from the hole
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   and he includes them in his elect third,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.260]   symbolically third.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.800]   He's got a third and he loves them.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.640]   He saved them.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.440]   He didn't let them perish.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.240]   And then he takes his loved ones,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.280]   his cherished, the apples of his eye,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.780]   and he puts them in the fire.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080]   Why?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.100]   Now this is normal Christianity.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.200]   Well, that's the Old Testament.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.320]   He doesn't do that anymore.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.560]   Listen to 1 Peter 4, 12.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.720]   "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   "when it comes upon you to test you
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.480]   "as though something strange were happening to you."
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.600]   That's crystal clear.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.320]   This is normal, not strange Christianity.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   God rescues us from hell and puts us in fire.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.160]   Got that?
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.840]   That's normal Christianity.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.760]   God rescues us from the flames of hell
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.640]   and puts us into refining flames.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.000]   Why?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.280]   Now, I don't want all the answers from all over the Bible.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.320]   I just want the answer from verse nine
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.880]   and it's crystal clear and it's simple and narrow and small
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   and big and huge and glorious.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.680]   It's about prayer.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.520]   So let's finish reading verse nine.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.240]   "I will test them as gold is tested.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   "They will call upon my name and I will answer them."
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.640]   That's all.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.200]   Nothing about getting their sex lives burned clean.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.800]   Nothing about getting their money mismanagement burned clean.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   Nothing about getting their power struggles
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.520]   and relational mess ups fixed.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   Just, "Then they'll call on me and I'll answer."
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.640]   God puts us in the fire to awaken earnest prayer.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.240]   Please, this is a plea now.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.640]   I'm pleading with you.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.200]   This verse is in the Bible to help this plea
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   that I'm about to make to you come true.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.840]   This verse is in the Bible so that the plea
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.400]   that I'm about to make to you will come true.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.480]   I can't make it come true.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.040]   This verse, by God's grace, with his power,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.960]   can make this come true.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.560]   I plead with you not to be among the number
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.820]   who gets sent to this school,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.720]   which is designed to awaken prayer
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.480]   and the school becomes the very reason you abandon prayer.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.200]   Thousands go to this school and turn on prayer.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.280]   If he treats me like this,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.100]   I'm not gonna ask him for anything
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.760]   because I asked him to keep me out of this
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   and he didn't do it.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.120]   And the very school designed to produce depth,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   trust, God-focused, man-diminishing, worshipful prayer
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:55.180]   is turned on its head and the school is hated.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.920]   And I'm pleading with you.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   This verse is in the Bible to help that not happen.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.980]   That's why it's here.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.220]   So that when you look around you
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.580]   and the flames are burning and you wonder,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.460]   God, what's up?
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.860]   This is up.
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.220]   This is up.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.880]   Don't teach him how to teach.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.720]   Submit.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.580]   Let me close with a quote from John Calvin.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.200]   I read Calvin on this text
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.760]   because next year is his 500th birthday.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.460]   So I'm poking around in Calvin a lot these days.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.560]   This is what he said and it's more true today
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.060]   than it was when he wrote it.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.520]   "It is therefore necessary that we should be subject
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.660]   "from first to last to the scourges of God."
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.800]   Scourges of God, the fire.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.380]   "In order that we may from the heart call on him.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.760]   "For our hearts are enfeebled by prosperity
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:15.360]   "so that we cannot make an effort to pray."
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.040]   If that's not the American church, I don't know what is.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.480]   "We are enfeebled by prosperity
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.280]   "so that we can scarcely make the effort to pray
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.680]   "because so many other good things,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.300]   "prosperous things, right things,
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.760]   "fill our powerless lives."
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.000]   So would you resolve with me
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.540]   that this simply will not happen to you in 2009?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   This meaning our hearts are enfeebled by prosperity
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   so that we cannot make the effort to pray.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.480]   Would you resolve with me, that's not gonna happen.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.700]   I'm not gonna let that happen.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.960]   Whatever it takes.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.860]   I'm not gonna be enfeebled by my prosperity.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:20.100]   I will put in place whatever it takes.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.720]   And may the Lord be gentle with us in the fires of 2009
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.440]   because they will come.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.560]   I hope you don't turn on him when they come.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.800]   - Sobering.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.760]   This clip was taken from John Piper's sermon
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.280]   on December 28th, 2008, as you heard
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.360]   nearing the end of the year
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.600]   and looking ahead to the new year of 2009.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   The sermon is titled,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.360]   "Put in the Fire for the Sake of Prayer."
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.240]   It's available online in its entirety at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.520]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.280]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.480]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.320]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.520]   and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.140]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.820]   Well, we've been working through Bible questions,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.500]   tough Bible questions from the first two chapters
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.740]   of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.540]   The third one is up next time on Friday.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.380]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke,
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.080]   We'll see you in a couple of days.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.240]   (upbeat music)
