[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   So wait a second, you guys I saw
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.360]   that you were at a CO2 conference or a TPG
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.320]   conference or at some banking conference, SACs.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.000]   Brian, I were both at the CO2 summit
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.240]   CO2 CO2 is a large investor is in a hedge fund private equity.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   There are late stage fund. It's a big late stage fund
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.320]   summit's a really big word. Was that a summit? Or is it more
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.880]   like a meeting?
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.640]   Well, it's like a two day conference in Santa Barbara.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.840]   Oh, nice.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.680]   They've done a number of years in a row now. Last year, Brian
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.480]   and I went and we met with SPF.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.000]   They were telling that SPF story.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.320]   No, let's go. Who's got crazier hair right now? You or SPF? Give
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.640]   us a quick take that hat off for a second. Take that Moncler off
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.640]   for a second. Let's get a side by side. Oh, my god. SACs is
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.680]   using no product.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.560]   It's not that bad. You're starting to look like the
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   Emperor, like Senator Palpatine from Star Wars. I mean, people
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120]   are having a field day with this crazy hair. But what was the
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.440]   vibe? If you said there was a vibe two years ago, the vibe was
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.720]   crypto mania. SPF was the bell of the ball. I suppose will be
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.320]   the bell of the ball when he goes in the who scout as well.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.720]   No, it looks like he's getting off. He's getting up. I thought
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.360]   he was getting off. I guess the fix in is the fixes in God. I
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.200]   agree. Can you imagine if he gets off? He's almost as
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.280]   protected as Hunter Biden.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.120]   Here we go. Okay, everybody. freeberg's not here this week.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.160]   Insert jokes and conspiracy theories for the mids. There's
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.520]   going to be about 8000 messages on a subreddit about freeberg
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.680]   missing this week and sacks missing last week. I'll let you
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   guys all read into it. But what would you say Brad? Brad
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.560]   Gerstner back? Of course, if bestie, Brad, what would you
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.080]   say the vibe was at this one? If it was SPF lunacy two years ago,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.280]   what was the vibe this year?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680]   Well, you know, first, they put on an incredible events called
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.240]   East meets West. And it was really about bringing, you know,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560]   CEOs and founders from China to the states and connecting them
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880]   with founders and CEOs in the United States. Listen, I think
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.080]   it's somber, right? There's a recognition that we've seen a
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.800]   bounce in the public markets, you know, off of this
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.520]   devastation in 2022. But I think listen, they gave a great tough
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.800]   love speech discussion with the 1400 unicorns that are out there
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.720]   and they said, Do not expect your own profitable tech company
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   to bounce like one of the magnificent seven, right? Those
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.680]   are highly profitable companies traded 1920 times earnings. And
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.440]   if you are burning cash today, there, you can't come back to
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.200]   the well. So you need to either figure out how to get profitable
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.520]   figure out how to get fit. Or you need to sell your business.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.160]   Because you know that there's not an endless stream of money.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.880]   So I thought it was a sober view. You know, Larry Summers was
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.480]   there. And I think a lot of the people called 22 right, we're
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.600]   looking for a hard landing in q1 of this year, probably
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.400]   including, you know, Larry was probably more in that camp. And
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.640]   I think everybody still views this distribution of
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880]   probabilities over the course of the next four quarters. And,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.280]   you know, whether it's Druckenmiller Sternlicht this
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.240]   morning on CNBC, or whether it's Larry Summers, they're all
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.600]   saying, well, we could 30% chance of a hard landing q4 q1.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.160]   So I would say it was so yeah, I could tell it was sober, Saxe.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.120]   But you want to say something?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   Well, I would say last year, it was somber in a different way.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.280]   Because you got to remember, in the first half of 2022, you had
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   this huge decline in the markets around growth stocks, because
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.640]   interest rates had started going up, we had the whole regime
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.600]   change. But I don't think founders had internalized the
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   way that it applied to them. And then the thing that has happened
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.720]   over the past year is that sales have been hit, you know, every
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.880]   software company I know is re forecasting down. It's so much
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   hard to grow customers are consolidating vendors,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.400]   sharpening their pencils, seed expansion has been replaced with
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.120]   seed contraction. So
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.560]   negotiations are hard, right? Yeah. So
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.440]   it's, it's much harder now to sell software than it was, let's
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.680]   say a year ago, you know, two x is now the new three x, if you
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.600]   can go to x in this environment, it's basically it's going through
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.200]   x before it's funny to me that how much the feds actions impact
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.360]   buying behavior, that's the thing that I
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.760]   understand. Cology is distinctly different. Yeah,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.720]   yeah, the psychology really is different. Yeah, I mean, we knew
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.640]   that the feds behavior influence valuations and sort of capital
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.920]   markets, but the way that it influences the business outlook
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.520]   and how willing companies are to spend money
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.480]   and CO2 is no different. I see they hired Billy McFarland from
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.680]   fire festival to do the food. What is this? I mean, coach who
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.320]   should be ashamed of themselves. Look at this focaccia. Some
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.280]   vegetable soup with the broth trained out super
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.920]   stimulating. So wrong. That is so wrong. Look at this. I mean,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.880]   it looks like a dog went to the bathroom.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.240]   Brian and I opened our lunchbox and we're like, let's let's go
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.400]   somewhere else. We got to go to on a budget. Wow. It look a
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.440]   surprise that someone to put a surprise in our
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   box. Friedberg's dog. Surprise in the coach to lunchbox. Wow.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.400]   Well, listen, it's good coach. He's very happy looking at that
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.640]   $7 lunch that they put out there. I mean,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   right. Should we tell the SPF story from last year summit? I
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   mean, last year, we talked about the maybe founders hadn't
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.680]   internalized yet, but the markets had corrected but the
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.080]   one founder who was super bullish and optimistic and
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.200]   talking about how he was spraying money all over the
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.440]   place and he was acquiring companies and who was followed
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.560]   around by minions and had everyone like a beehive
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.280]   surrounding him and trying to talk to him was SPF. And so I
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.640]   remember Yeah, so I remember thinking like, who's gonna be
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.160]   this year's SPF? You know, somebody here was somebody with
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.000]   an AI was Sam Altman there.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   So basically, the CO2 conference went from bullshit to dog shit.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.960]   I'm like, look at Brad is so uncomfortable. Brad's like, I
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   like this invite. I got a good invite. Chamath and I are
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.120]   invited to nothing. We give no shits about CO2 or their budget.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.600]   They do put on a really good event. Incredible firm. And I
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.400]   think that the message they gave to founders for the event this
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.160]   year and last year was great. It was actually really appropriate.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.320]   Whether founders choose to listen is a different story. But
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.920]   the message they've been conveying is similar to the
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.760]   message we've been conveying for the last year and a half
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   HM off any more jokes we can make about CO2 since you and I
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.840]   get invited to nothing.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.560]   No, I mean, I'm not making fun of CO2. I was just making fun of
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.960]   the fact that we went from literally bullshit with SPF to
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.080]   what looks like dog shit.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.000]   By the way, I bet they would invite you if you wanted to go.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.440]   I'm pretty sure they would send 10 invitations if I if I even
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.840]   fainted desire to go. But I'm in Milan right now. The pods very
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.880]   popular there. By the way, I know you did a focus group. Tell
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.200]   everybody I can we play the focus group or was that I think
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.640]   we can play
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.960]   it just a fan a fan came up to me. I mean, when I say fan, this
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.880]   is like a very high profile person. This woman works at
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.280]   Netflix. She works at Netflix and her husband is the founder of a
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.840]   startup. She said she's a fan of the pod. So I started asking her
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.160]   questions about it. The focus group because you know, we've
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.720]   been having this debate over the last couple of weeks about what
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.400]   issues we should be talking about. And certain people on the
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.960]   pod never want to discuss politics. It's not like I only
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.440]   want to discuss politics. I just don't want to exclude it. I
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.320]   think we should just be talking about whatever the biggest
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.040]   issues are in the world in any given week current events. Yeah,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.320]   I mean, whether it's business markets or politics, and she
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.280]   confirmed that was basically right, don't change it. So I
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.640]   don't know why we would want to change the formula for the pot
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.240]   at this point.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.640]   Every week, sex. There's a group of people who are like, stop
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.200]   talking about politics. And then there's another group of people
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.920]   and their feedback is why didn't you talk about a hundred Biden
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   Ukraine, Ukraine, Putin, China, whatever. And so the docket is
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.520]   the docket just to let the audience know, not that it's
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.160]   like all that big of a deal, it should be fairly obvious.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.240]   Everybody has equal input on the docket. So it's not like anybody
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   owns the docket. If you want to talk about something, you talk
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.920]   about something, but some people want to not talk about politics.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.280]   Some people want to talk about a lot of politics, the
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.100]   magnificent seven for those people who didn't catch the
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.400]   reference is I think something Kramer has been talking about on
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.560]   CNBC. Seven stocks make up the most of the gains this year
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.580]   meta Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.400]   Can I tell you guys my welcome back to Milan story? Oh, yeah,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   absolutely. So I'm back in Milan for the summer on his throne.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.800]   So chef Stefano and if you could say hi to Stephanie, all my
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.920]   friends, butlers, everybody tell you're back in Italy because the
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.760]   buttons are gone. I'm working from my office here. But this
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.400]   morning, I went to Coppola, which is my stylist, my
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.600]   hairdresser. Oh, and the thing is, there's like a hierarchy,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.000]   the hairdressers. And so Roberto, this guy, Roberto, he's
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.520]   like the sort of top of the ticket. And Nat has first dibs
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.640]   with Roberto. And I have this other guy who's excellent. His
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.440]   name is Joaquin. Oh, yes. You guys will see Joaquin in a few
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.780]   weeks. Anyways, the best thing about the haircuts at this
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.680]   place, Coppola is you get a hair fluffer, which means that as
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.880]   your keynote Roberto cuts your hair, a guy comes in, he just
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.240]   like he like does this and then he like, you're padding your
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   hair in a very he he fluffs your hair. Very uncomfortable. It's a
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.480]   laughing that doesn't exist anywhere that will never get
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.080]   disrupted by AI. And it's incredible. A hairstyling for
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   the hair fluffer, the air buffer gets like a 50 euro tip doesn't
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.680]   matter what he does. Wow, when sacks rolls in, you're gonna
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.560]   need to fluffers with that. One on each side. I mean, the tufts
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.160]   are getting crazy. Saks tell me if you want your keynote to cut
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.880]   your hair because when you come because he will do it, he'll do
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.280]   an incredible job and I'll ask him to bring the air fluffer.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.760]   All right, listen, I think we just going back to the CO2
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.440]   thing. I know we're in a high interest rate. lunch environment.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.900]   The herb environment is hard right now for everybody, but we
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.920]   did get the feedback. Let's play the feedback.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.760]   Hey guys, I'm at the CO2 summit and just met a fan who wants to
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.400]   explain the magic of the pod because you guys keep wanting to
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.440]   change things and mess things up. So
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.320]   my husband and I were listening to your podcast pretty much
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.920]   religiously. And there is this incredible magic that the four
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   of you have the repartee back and forth. It's super
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.080]   informative, but you're all sort of rooting for characters
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.880]   almost. So it's almost like a scripted show in some way. So I
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.720]   have my favorite character. My husband has his favorite
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.760]   character. I won't say who's who. I want you all to stay
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.920]   together and keep doing the show. But it's fantastic. And we
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   love it.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.840]   And you work at Netflix, right?
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.640]   I work at Netflix back in the day I produce shows. So pick up
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.880]   the show. I was just telling David trying to get that magic.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.920]   You can put any number of scripts together. But once you
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   get the cast on the floor, and actually start getting you know,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   that chemistry going, that's when the magic happens. And you
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   guys kind of just nailed it.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.200]   Alright, so that's a professional right there. So
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.880]   stop screwing with the formula. Stop protesting.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.400]   Oh,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.760]   I mean, the camera really does that 10 pounds, doesn't it?
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   I take two things away from this. Number one, she's much
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.040]   more charismatic on camera than sacks. She stole the show. She's
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   delightful. And then to that sweater. Oh, my Lord.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.560]   What's fantastic. No, the sweater is fantastic. The shirts
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.040]   fantastic. I just think they may not have been. I don't think the
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.480]   intention was to mesh the two together. But there are too many
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.680]   buttons for you to mouth. No, bro. When you have a cream
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.320]   colored sweater, you can't wear a red checkered shirt. It's just
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   not. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Red Striped. Anyways, it's a Yeah. I
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.560]   mean, it looks like you're wearing an Italian tablecloth
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.640]   under there from a pizzeria. Combined with like an $8,000
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.600]   sweater. It's great. But the hair, I mean, the hair is out of
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.840]   control. I think there's fantastic. I do. Do not cut the
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.640]   hair. Don't let your kino touch your hair, bro.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.880]   I'll just get a fluff. I'll tell him just flop it. Don't just
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.360]   let your winners ride.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.200]   Rain Man David Sack.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.240]   And instead, we open sources to the fans and they've just gone
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.640]   crazy.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:38.520]   Let's talk about the Zuck Elon cage match.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. This is a little worried for my friend
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   here. Yeah. So I don't know if he's on is completely up to
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.400]   date on what kind of shape Zuck is in. Zuck is in tremendous
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.320]   shape. He's got like a dojo at his house. He's been getting
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.480]   training in you know, mixed martial arts from jujitsu
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.680]   increases or whoever, you know, Brazilian jujitsu. Yeah,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.720]   competing in events. Zuck is in tremendous shape. And no joke
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   here. Now. Elon's a big guy. Elon's a monster. But I mean,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.320]   Elon's not he was not in this kind of shape. You don't have
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.400]   time to work out like this. I hope you get some sort of Gracie
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.880]   on your team to train you up for this thing. Also, Elon has a neck
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.000]   injury that he got. Yeah, from that sumo thing years ago. Yes.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.280]   And he's had to have surgeries on it. So it really suck if that
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.440]   would get re triggered.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.840]   Here's the thing, though, he did take on a sumo wrestler. We were
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   there for that at his birthday party. And he held his own
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.720]   against the giant sumo wrestler. If you want does get on top of
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.080]   and do the waris on top of zuck zuck has no chance. You're
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.280]   telling me what he should do is
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   abandon the mission to Mars. Yes. Stop electrifying the
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.560]   world. And stop free internet around the world. Yeah. So he
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.880]   can beat up Zuck.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.840]   I mean, to a vote.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.000]   He got suckers number one.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.480]   This is the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard in my life. Oh my
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.800]   god. I love the banter between the two of them. And let's just
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.440]   say we can all agree out of all the companies, right? There's
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.600]   only one contender to zuck getting fit. Right getting that
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.320]   company fit getting himself fit. Zilon Yeah, 75 80% of the people
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.360]   gone and product velocity is on fire at Twitter. So this is
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.440]   this would be a cage match between the two who have
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.480]   defined this era of getting fit.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.800]   All right, let's get to the docket here. What the fuck are
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.840]   you talking about? He's using the fitness guy burned a quarter
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.240]   trillion dollars and then found a way to stop it.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   That's very different than firing on all cylinders and
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.800]   three companies.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.440]   By the way, I am the only one of anybody I think that knows. Well,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.280]   maybe sacks. Well, it's kind of like, you know, if you've got
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.400]   like a faucet running, and it's spilling over the sink, and then
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.280]   you turn it off. That doesn't make you a firefighter.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.560]   plumber.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:22.240]   Stop spending money on there's this feature of a bathtub where
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.320]   when you get into it, and the water gushes so violently over
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.400]   the over the outside of it, and then there's a drain at the top
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.000]   as well as the bottom. And so then eventually it just stops.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.000]   Yes, you could.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.120]   Yeah, but Chamath raised a good point, which is look, Elon's a
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.360]   big guy. If he got training in MMA, I'm sure he'd do fine. But
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.600]   we don't want Elon spending two hours a day for the next six
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.400]   months or whatever. Because that's been doing MMA, I guess
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.920]   for a while, a couple years, maybe years into it. Yeah. All
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.800]   right. Well, listen, there's been some updates.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.200]   This war
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   between Russia and the Ukraine or the invasion of Ukraine by
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.240]   Russia. You wrote a piece about it in what was it the Federalist
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.320]   I think this week titled the truth about Ukraine's falling
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.840]   failing counter offensive and the peace that could have been
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.320]   why don't you give us an overview of what you wrote and
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.080]   what your take is on the state of affairs right now?
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.280]   Well, the thing that's been going on since around June 4,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.520]   or June 5, is this long awaited Ukrainian counter offensive.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.440]   This has been touted for a long time as is going to reverse
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.080]   Russian territorial gains. Ukraine's gonna use all this
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.720]   modern Western equipment, these leopard tanks that have come
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.920]   from Germany and Bradley's from the United States, and a lot of
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.480]   other NATO or American equipment, and they're going to
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.040]   push Russia out of their country. This has been told to
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   us since the fall of last year, since that sort of car key
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.840]   counter offensive, produce some Ukrainian territorial gains,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.400]   you've had former generals like Ben Hodges and Petraeus say
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.760]   that this counter offensive is going to be highly successful.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.920]   Where it stands right now is that around 18 or 19 days into
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.720]   it, it has produced minimal gains. In fact, it's been
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   somewhat of a disaster. It's hard to get conclusive estimates
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.240]   of personnel and material losses. But I think as many as a
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.920]   quarter of the tanks and armored vehicles have already been
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.720]   destroyed. And the casualties may be as high as around 10,000
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.160]   out of an army that was trained up for this purpose of around
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.560]   50,000. So so far, it has not gone well, the the Ukrainian
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.320]   army hasn't even made it to the first line of defense. So what
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.120]   the Russians did is they created three fortified lines or belts
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.040]   of defense. And then in front of that is what they call a gray
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.600]   zone or security zone or crumple zone, which is an area they can
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.080]   test, but it's not technically a fortified line. The Ukrainians
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.640]   are still in that sort of gray zone, they are not punching
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.000]   through they are not even at the first Russian fortified line to
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.280]   give you some idea of what's involved here. The Russians have
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.520]   these obstacles, there's basically trenches have been
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.280]   dug, there's ditches that would stop tanks or sort of force them
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.440]   to go in a certain direction, steer the traffic, there's
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.680]   extensive minefields, they've got these things called dragon
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.920]   teeth, which are concrete bollards that stop tanks or move
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.200]   them in a certain direction. Then the Russians have massive
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.440]   amounts of artillery, they've got infantry on the ground that
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.280]   helps spot the artillery. And if all of that doesn't take out
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.960]   these Ukrainian tanks, they've got these attack helicopters that
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.280]   come in almost uncontested. Because at this point, it
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.000]   doesn't look like the Ukrainians have any air defense. And
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.800]   they've also got fixed wing aircraft that are capable of
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.840]   dropping precision munitions. So it really seems like the Russians
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.880]   have fixed a lot of the problems that they had last fall in their
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.840]   army. And so far, it seems like this counter offensive is not
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.520]   going anywhere.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.800]   We're 16 months into this trim off and clearly fatigue is
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.520]   setting in. It's not commanding the new cycle here in America.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:19.480]   And on a percentage basis, even the neocons and Republicans are
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.160]   dropping their support for this at a pretty precipitous rate,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.200]   which is predictable. Americans don't want to be in forever
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.120]   wars. We all know that. So what's your take on how this
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.960]   winds up, especially in relation to a, our budget and be this
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.800]   upcoming election, which this seems to be will be a major
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.840]   issue if this isn't resolved. By the time we get into the 24
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.560]   election cycle.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.520]   As part of answering this, I have a question for sacks. But
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.720]   is it true that there was a ceasefire like Putin had a press
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.640]   conference where he showed a document that he said was a
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.280]   ceasefire that then the United States apparently sent Boris
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.040]   Johnson over to Russia, Ukraine to basically blow up blow up
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.720]   the agreement.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.200]   This is a this is finally correct.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.800]   This wasn't a ceasefire. This was a peace deal before the war
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   started, correct? No, it was a claim.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.760]   There were rounds of negotiation before the war. Notably, there
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.520]   was a round of diplomacy between Blinken and Lavrov in January,
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.680]   the month before the war, where Blinken said that we cannot
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.840]   compromise on NATO's open door policy, that that sort of
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   diplomacy fell apart. But then after the war, there was a
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.880]   meeting of the Russian delegation and Ukrainian
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.640]   delegation in Istanbul, under the supervision of Erdogan in
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.800]   Turkey, Naftali Bennett also had a similar process. In both
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.000]   cases, the West rejected a peace deal.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.680]   Allegedly, we don't this is Putin we're talking about.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.920]   Hold on a second. Let me come back to the evidence for in a
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   second. But yeah, what the deal would have provided is that the
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.480]   Russians would move back to pre war lines. If the Ukrainians
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.760]   would agree not to become a member of NATO. However, the
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.000]   Ukrainians could still receive specified security guarantees
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.880]   from the West. That was the deal. Now, well, we have now
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   multiple data points. You've got Naftali Bennett saying that he
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.640]   thought a deal was on these lines, but it was rejected by
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.480]   the West. You also have now Putin showing the very document,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.800]   which was signed by the Ukrainian delegation. So this
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.720]   was the document document, right? Nobody has this document.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.280]   It hasn't been released yet. I hope the Russian government
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.600]   releases it for the purposes of history. So we can inspect it.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.680]   But nobody can test this document is real. Remember, if
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.720]   he's just making this up, you would think that Erdogan would
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.960]   basically come forward and say, No, this is fake. There's too
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.240]   many people who are in that room who'd be able to say this
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.040]   document is fake. No one has done that. So I think there's
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.800]   every reason to believe this document is real. Now, it is not
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   a final agreement, it appears to be a preliminary agreement or an
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.560]   outline. But the outline is that Russia is saying we will move
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.200]   back to pre war lines, if you agree not to become part of NATO
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.400]   and that deal was rejected when Boris Johnson flew into Kiev,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.000]   and basically told the Ukrainians, we do not want to
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   make a deal with Putin, we want to pressure Putin. And the
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   source for that is not the Russians. The source for that is
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.520]   a Ukrainian publication called Ukrainian Pravda, up. And they
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.000]   ran an article in May of 2022 that I can put on the screen.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.960]   And it is the source for saying that Boris Johnson came in and
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.080]   told Zelensky, we do not want to make a peace deal. We the West
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.000]   are not ready to make a deal with Putin. We want you to fight
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   Putin or pressure Putin. And if you do, we will give you advanced
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.400]   weapons systems. And that is when the deal fell apart. If you
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.360]   look at the timing of it, this is this has been so this has
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.960]   been lightly sourced here. So let's go there. But you have to
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.440]   consider the source here. This is a pro Ukrainian publication,
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.280]   writing in May of 2022. Now, the tone of the article and what they
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.440]   basically say in this article is that Zelensky accepted Boris
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.800]   Johnson's offer. In other words, he took the gamble. And at this
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   point in time, you've got to remember, this is two months
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   after the war started, it looked like the Ukrainians were doing
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.600]   well. So up was essentially praising Zelensky in this
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.800]   article, for taking the West up on this deal to pressure Putin
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.720]   rather than make peace. Now, a year later, it looks like this
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.760]   gamble was a disaster. Yeah. And so that is the real conclusion
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.880]   here. A deal was available, but the West chose not to take it. By
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.720]   the way, Fiona Hill, who is a Russia hawk. And you could
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.000]   almost put her I'd say, neocon adjacent has basically said that
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.480]   this type of deal was available. The West did not want this deal.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   I think Jason, maybe to give you an answer. My thought is that
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.880]   this week was a very bad week for establishment politics and
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.760]   institutions. Because on the one hand, if you take the Russia
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.280]   incident in the Ukraine war, what you saw was that there were
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.480]   ample numbers of off ramps that we chose, frankly, to not take
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.840]   so that we could engage our enemy in some long drawn out
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.320]   war on the hopes that it just depletes their resources. That's
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.800]   kind of rolling the dice, I think, in a very dangerous way.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.720]   I think this week, we also saw some published stuff on COVID
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.880]   and the COVID vaccine, which also debunked a lot of widely
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.760]   held truths. And it turned out that folks that may have been
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.040]   conspiracy theorists, quote, unquote, were right there as
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.400]   well. So I think it's just an uncomfortable set of facts that
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.760]   again, just reinforce that if you're not really thinking for
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.720]   yourself, you're not going to see the totality of what's
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.760]   actually going on. I think with respect to Russia, Ukraine,
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.800]   everybody has moved on. And so sadly, the only people that are
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.720]   left over are the people that have to fight the war, we're
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.800]   still separated from their families, there's the people
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.240]   that are dying. There was an article I think today, they
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.680]   recruit prisoners, right. So obviously, some of the prisoners
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.560]   that Russia users are still pretty crazy. That person went
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.920]   on some rampage inside of a train, killed a couple people
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.160]   stabbed some other people, there was just pictures of blood
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.520]   everywhere. I mean, this is just a horrible situation. And it's
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.400]   still not clear to me why we didn't take the offer. If in
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.320]   fact, it's real. So I just want to keep putting that disclaimer
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.920]   out there. Because Putin flashing a document doesn't make
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.160]   all this true. It doesn't mean it's not true.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.640]   What about Ukrainian Pravda?
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.720]   Well, Jason, I would say what about I am just being clear
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.240]   here that none of the data points you need, I would say
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.480]   what are you talking about? Naftali Bennett confirmed it.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.640]   What incentives the Israeli former Israeli leader have to
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.560]   lie about this?
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.280]   Here's what I would say, Jason, I think that something like that
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:49.800]   is so profoundly important, that if it were not true, I think it
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   would have been very important for the powers that be to
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.360]   discredit it almost immediately, so that they didn't have to look
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.200]   like they were warmongering unnecessarily.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.720]   Can I also up level and connect to this point about the
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   establishment? Because I think there's been a lot of pushback
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.240]   to even challenging the status quo, even having a conversation
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   about Ukraine or having a conversation about COVID. And I
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.640]   think if there's one thing this pod represents the fight going
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.760]   on at Twitter represents is the need to have this conversation.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.600]   If we look at the wars the US has engaged in since September
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.760]   11, it's estimated three to 4 million people have died in
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:44.360]   Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, we spent $8 trillion. Inflation
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.200]   adjusted, we spent 4 trillion in World War Two. 8 trillion
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:56.120]   represents 25% of our entire national debt. And I've yet to
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.360]   meet a single parent who said to me, I care so much about this
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.680]   Ukraine situation, I would be willing to put my children in
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   harm's way to fight for the defense of Europe. Okay, so
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.080]   those data points tell me at a very minimum, we need more of
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.120]   this discussion, more of this debate, not less.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.640]   The idea that that we could be tiptoeing closer and closer to
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.200]   some land war in Europe unnecessarily. And I think the
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.760]   bigger issue is and you can't trust what you're being told.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.200]   And I think that that's what's very
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.520]   problematic is a bigger picture. And just so we're clear here,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.920]   I'm not saying I'm on either side of this. I'm just pointing
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.320]   out that this is all still very thinly sourced.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.640]   No, it's not.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.960]   Until the West confirms any of this, I think expect the West to
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.040]   do you expect the State Department to issue a press
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.480]   release saying, yep, we fucked up. It's on me.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.920]   My theory. My, my theory has been I and I've been very clear
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.560]   on this podcast. My theory has been since the beginning, they
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.160]   want to deplete Russia and they want to deplete their army and
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.680]   not capabilities and have regime change and Putin. I'm not saying
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.040]   I'm for that just for the people.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.120]   I'm not no no no no no.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.400]   Encole Putin. That was a crude language.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.920]   That is what they that is what they plan on doing. Yes, I think
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.720]   that's what they're doing. And I
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.440]   believe Austin, our Secretary of Defense said that our purpose
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.920]   was to weaken Russia. Yeah. So to knock it out.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.080]   I agree. That's what our purposes. Yes. I think they
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   want regime change. Yes.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.920]   That's what Boris Johnson went to Kiev and said, we want to
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.600]   pressure Putin not make a deal with him. So they ordered this
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.920]   war they they prefer
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.480]   that's been my theory since the
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.840]   beginning preferred to fight a proxy war of choice. That was
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.040]   not
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.440]   I'm not endorsing that. I'm not endorsing that.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.080]   Take NATO expansion off the table.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.520]   This is not about you, Jason. I'm asking a simple question.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.440]   But Saks just said it was too much. So I'm just clearing. He
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.640]   just said that was your position. And I'm correct.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.760]   Okay, fair enough, Jason.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.120]   Have the right to correct you. That was not my position. I
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.320]   said,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.000]   I actually agree with you. If you're saying that that was our
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.680]   government's objective, which was to weaken Putin. I agree
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.640]   with you. They've chose to fight an optional proxy war of choice
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.400]   that was easily avoidable if they just take a NATO expansion
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.640]   off the table, because they thought it would weaken Putin.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.840]   But here's the rub on this. It has not weakened Putin. It has
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.200]   weakened the United States and our allies. Anyway, you want to
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.880]   look at this thing, look at just the weapons and munitions. So we
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.400]   are out of 155 millimeter artillery shells, we cannot
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.160]   produce enough. This is the crazy thing. We spent 800
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.720]   billion a year plus on the Pentagon and our national
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.920]   defense. We're out of ammo. I mean, we must be getting so
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.000]   royally ripped off by the military industrial complex.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.680]   Okay, we cannot produce ammo fast enough. That's why
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.640]   Ukraine's losing this war. The balance of artillery favors
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.040]   Russia. Russia is basically using about 20,000 shells a day.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.280]   The Ukrainians are using somewhere between three and 6,000.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.960]   We are out of ammo, we cannot produce enough.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.520]   And this actually dovetails nicely with another story this
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.880]   week. There is a journalist named Matt. Euglesius is that
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.360]   his pronounce his name? Yeah. Euglesius. And he said, I mean,
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.600]   he literally said the quiet part out loud. And I'll just quote,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.720]   because he was criticizing you and Chamath for hosting RFK,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.240]   we'll get to that in a second. But he basically said, this is
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.720]   actually a really good idea for us. Basically, NATO equipment
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.840]   plus Ukrainian lives are being traded for Russian equipment and
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.440]   Russian lives, which leaves NATO coming out ahead. That's doubly
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.600]   true, because NATO is much richer than Russia. So we win a
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   long term game of everyone explode their weapons as fast as
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   they can make them again, though, what makes that really
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.960]   true is NATO material is killing Russian soldiers, while Russian
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.160]   material is killing Ukrainian soldiers. That's a deal in our
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.840]   favor. I mean, that is a cynical
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.800]   to be clear of that. Yeah, he wrote that last year in defense
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.120]   of the war, basically, like all the neocons, he's sort of an
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.320]   establishment approved intellectual, they think he's
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.480]   smart, I think he's really foolish. He basically wants to
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.600]   fight the last Ukrainian here, for the sole purpose of blowing
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.440]   up Russia's stockpiles. The reason this is so dumb is Russia
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.200]   can always make more, those lives aren't coming back. But
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.080]   they can always produce more artillery, more weapons. And in
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.560]   fact, the Russian war machine is now ramping up to full
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.360]   production. Okay, they are ramping up the number of people
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.320]   in their army, I think it's estimated that by the end of the
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.160]   year, they're gonna have 750,000 men under arms, they've ramped
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.960]   up artillery shells production, they're at something like one
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.480]   and a half million. At the beginning of the war, we were
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.120]   only producing 14,000 artillery shells a month, mostly for
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.560]   training purposes in the United States. We've since ramped that
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.840]   up to 20,000. But that's still massively trails what the
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.760]   Russians can do. And they're trying to hold on, they're
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.560]   trying to ramp it up to 90,000 a month. But that's going to take
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.040]   till 2028. Because, you know, it takes time to build it, you got
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.240]   to build up new factories, new production lines, you got to
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.600]   issue contracts to suppliers or vendors, it takes time to do
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.000]   this. But the Russians have ramped up their war machine. And
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.720]   then the other thing that's happened is that Russia and
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   China have entered a de facto alliance, and including Iran. So
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.280]   you now have the cementing of this giant alliance in Asia,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.160]   between China, Russia and Iran. They're sharing equipment now
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.240]   together, Iran is producing drones for Russia, Russia is now
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.480]   going to be giving advanced fighter jets to Iran. So this
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.880]   idea that this war has made the West stronger is depleting the
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.160]   West over an objective, we didn't need to fight this war
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.920]   was easily avoidable. And we have now created, I think, the
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.520]   most fearsome opponent that America has ever faced, we have
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.400]   never faced a adversary with a combined manufacturing capacity
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.640]   and raw materials of China, Russia and Iran. If we were to
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.400]   get in a war, a new world war against this sort of new axis,
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.200]   we could lose, they actually have more manufacturing capacity
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.280]   to produce weapons of war, and munitions and ammo than the
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.080]   United States does.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.760]   China has been clear that they're not going to provide
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:02.360]   weapons to Russia. And so I'm not sure that that alliance is
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.400]   exactly accurate.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.360]   They've given us no such assurance. All they've said is
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.320]   they haven't done it yet.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's a theoretical thing that you're talking about here that
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.000]   could be very serious. I think your point and this is to Brad's
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   point, we should be having a very thoughtful discussion here.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.800]   Because if China did pick Russia, which they haven't, and
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.200]   they went to war, it would be worldwide.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.600]   Well, we should talk about the China relationship, actually.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   Yeah. Okay. Lincoln just went to China. And this was the first
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.800]   trip for an American Secretary of State. Since 2018. Obviously,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   things have been strained with the spy balloon and the visits
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.120]   to Taiwan. Blinken gave some basic goals for this engagement
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.080]   with China, the fentanyl problem, some detained Americans
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.560]   and protecting US citizens working in China. Those were
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:58.760]   kind of the easy checkboxes. But they wanted to create also an
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.880]   open line of communication between our militaries, which
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.560]   China wasn't super stoked on wouldn't agree to.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.440]   Tony did a great job. Yeah. Okay. I think what's really
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.080]   disappointing is that while Tony's over there doing this
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.240]   hard work, which is must be tough to do, because it must
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.800]   have been a little bit like dancing on eggshells a little
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.720]   bit, right? He had to be intense. Yeah, he had to be very
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.640]   thoughtful, very measured. But as far as I could tell, he did a
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.120]   fabulous job. Now, full disclosure, he's a friend of
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.200]   mine. So maybe I'm biased. But then over here, Biden at some
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   mid level fundraiser in California is calling she a
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.760]   dictator. How hard must it be for you to try to do your job
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.320]   when your boss is just like, completely undisciplined, like
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.840]   here. And here's the problem with that is that if the United
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.240]   States actually thought that she was a dictator, do you think
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   that a mid level fundraiser that we were all invited to in
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.480]   Northern California that none of us said yes to is the place to
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.680]   announce a foreign policy shift like that? Absolutely not. So it
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   just means that again, there's just more evidence about Biden
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.000]   being very undisciplined. Now, again, that could be an age
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.440]   issue, it could be a mental acuity issue. We don't know
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.080]   because we're not given a chance to really prosecute that
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.240]   problem. Meanwhile, Tony's there trying to do the best job he can
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.280]   and the sand shift underneath him. Thank God he was able to
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.680]   get the trip done before this thing happened is what I think
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.960]   but that gap was a very big gap and a very big problem. I think
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.600]   because whatever goodwill he built up was practically flushed
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.800]   down the toilet if you saw the reaction from the Chinese, which
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.160]   was to be deeply offended. And it makes no sense to poke. Yeah.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.520]   When he went to see NPS and they had to negotiate a fist bump
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.240]   versus a handshake. Like what is all of this either unplanned or
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.840]   undisciplined theater? Why are we engaging in any of this stuff?
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.400]   It doesn't make any sense to
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.880]   moth Joe, Joe Biden's always been known for being a liability
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.480]   in terms of these statements. When he worked for Obama, he was
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.400]   the VP. He also said things you know, he shot from the hip a lot
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.720]   you should not be calling him a dictator when you're trying to
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.520]   do this critical work. It's a stupid move. I think everybody
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.960]   can agree. You were gonna say something, Brad?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.960]   Yeah, I was just gonna say, you know, kind of market reaction
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.040]   going in. So the K web, the Chinese index was up about 20%
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.520]   heading into the series of meetings. Now, notably, Blinken
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.840]   was not scheduled to have a meeting with she. And so what
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.360]   happened is on day one, there's a meeting with the foreign
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.840]   minister, right? And it seems that there was some positive
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.000]   trend lines coming out of these first two meetings with the top
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.160]   diplomat with foreign minister, which led to the meeting. And
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.400]   notably in the meeting, he did say, the United States has not
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.240]   changed his policy on Taiwan, we don't support Taiwanese
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.560]   independence. Now, the market reaction post visit was down 10%.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.640]   And I think this is owing to what Chamas said that people
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.800]   felt like maybe we took a step forward here that we at least
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.840]   had a meeting, but then it was a another step back. And so I
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.880]   think where we sit at the moment is there probably going to be
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.400]   some follow on meetings coming out of this. This was not, you
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.120]   know, a path back to where we were, but I think it was a
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   stabilizing moment. And, you know, again, we were just at the
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.520]   East meets West conference, where there are a lot of Chinese
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.160]   CEOs and founders who were there. And I think the idea there
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.880]   was like, things are stable, like not getting worse. And by
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.240]   the way, six months ago, there was a real concern that things
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.000]   were deteriorating quickly. So I think it's, you know, you can
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.800]   see something constructive coming out of this,
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.520]   not getting worse was how I felt coming out of it. And then
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   Biden then makes it worse is really it is a I agree, it's
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.800]   just a stupid gap.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.520]   Let me tell you about some of the reporting from the Chinese
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.720]   side. So after these diplomatic events, and you're right,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.920]   Blinken met with Wang Yi for seven hours, then he got an
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   audience with Xi Jinping. They do these readouts where each
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.560]   side basically produces a public summary of the meeting. In the
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.760]   Chinese readout, they said that US Chinese relationships are at
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.440]   the lowest point they've ever been. I mean, since I guess,
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   diplomatic relations were kind of reestablished under Nixon, so
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.920]   that from the Chinese standpoint, they believe that
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.400]   relationships are at the worst they've ever been. Moreover, the
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.840]   US sought to put Ukraine on the agenda. The Chinese response to
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.440]   that was we are not interested in discussing our relationship
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.160]   with Russia, that is none of your business. So this idea,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.520]   there's been this neocon fantasy, that somehow China
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.200]   would help us in this war between Russia and Ukraine. And
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.800]   I've said all along that the last thing China wants is for
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.880]   neocons to achieve their objectives with respect to
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.040]   Russia, because then China alone will be in the gun sights of US
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.440]   talks. So China will do what it has to do to support and even
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:02.640]   prop up Russia, if they have to. Remember, China, and, and Russia,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.360]   and specifically Xi and Putin. They're the two leaders who've
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.560]   met with each other more often than any other leader, and
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.920]   they've called each other their best friends or most I think the
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.560]   language they use was most besties. Well, most bosom
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.120]   friends was what they called it. Okay, that's a little weird.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.440]   Those are buddies. Yeah, but
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.760]   there's somebody great TV show. Good. Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.440]   To give people exactly what happened. Biden, when he was at
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.280]   this campaign fundraiser in NorCal that, again, yeah, we
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.400]   were probably invited to people on the show. He was talking
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.560]   about the military, Chinese spy balloon, and he said she got
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.240]   very upset, quote, that this was a great embarrassment for
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.960]   dictators when they don't know what happened. And he continued
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.200]   to say that she didn't know the balloon had been over the
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.080]   continental US and was off course near Alaska. And this is
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.640]   the kind of thing where he's basically saying she is stupid,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.920]   or, you know, whatever. Or there's some level of
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.240]   incompetence over there. It's exactly the wrong message you
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.120]   want to send, calling him a dictator and calling him stupid
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.080]   and saying he was embarrassed. Like, why would you provoke
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.760]   that? To raise money or to be a tough guy? It makes no sense. I
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   mean, it sounds like Trump's version of foreign
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.200]   from the Chinese standpoint, they thought the whole balloon
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.360]   thing was a travesty. I mean, I don't know what the truth of it
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.120]   is. But they feel like it was just this continuous drumming up
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   of outrage on the American side against China. And they wanted
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.360]   to put that behind us in terms of the relationship. I heard
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.800]   Blinken interviewed about this term. I agree with you. I have
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.760]   no complaint with Blinken in terms of how he handled this
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.560]   meeting. I have a complaint about how I have a complaint
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.520]   about how he's handled Moscow, but but not Beijing. But they
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.560]   wanted to put this balloon business behind them. My guess
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.960]   I've always said that it never made sense to me that the
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.680]   Chinese would use such a ham fisted way of conducting
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.800]   espionage to fly, deliberately fly a balloon over the US. It
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.200]   never deliberate. It never made sense to me. Yeah. And it became
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.080]   this cause celebre in the US. And I think the Chinese at a
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.240]   minimum wanted to put it behind us. And then Biden reopened the
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.360]   issue. Like this submarine tragedy, the balloon is like
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.920]   made for network television, because it's a live event where
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.120]   you can put live cameras up. And you can cover 24 seven. It's
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.880]   just like, we better be really careful. It's just media. It's
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.520]   for the media. It's catnip for them.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.760]   We have to be very careful. Now, I think in our relationship
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.680]   with China, because again, you now have this Asiatic alliance
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.960]   between China, Russia and, and Iran. It is the most capable,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   let's say, average 30, the United States ever faced
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.280]   remember, that when we face the Soviet Union, their economy was
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.720]   never bigger than one third of the US economy, the Soviet
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.080]   bloc versus the Western bloc, the Chinese economy, on a
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.880]   purchasing power parity basis is roughly the same size as the US.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.240]   And they've got more manufacturing capacities. If you
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.920]   think about the type of manufacturing capacity United
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.160]   States had during World War Two, that now belongs to China, not
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.680]   the US we have hollowed out
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.640]   I just don't understand why, why our foreign policy, Brad, I'll
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.400]   bring you into this discussion, why our foreign policy isn't
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.080]   being driven by some of the things that we could do
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.800]   together to collaborate on, like we have global warming, we have,
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.800]   you know, issues on this planet that we could collaborate on.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.720]   And it seems like we're spending no time on those issues and
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.040]   saber rattling Cuba, another example, why can't we set a goal
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.840]   for the United States to normalize relations with Cuba
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.400]   and get them on our side, since they are the equivalent of,
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.720]   let's say, Ukraine, David, to America, you've, you've brought
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.400]   it back comparison, why don't we make peace with Cuba? Why can't
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.480]   we have a peace based foreign policy where we're trying to
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.160]   build bridges, God, Cuba and United States could do amazing
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   things together. And we should be trying to win that
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.080]   relationship instead of living 50 years in the past over it.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.200]   I'm not sure
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.400]   there was legitimate outrage over the past week, because we
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.880]   discovered that China was planning on they already have an
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.360]   intelligence outpost in Cuba, listening outpost, but also
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.560]   they're thinking about doing training of troops in Cuba. And
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.000]   that would be a violation of Monroe doctrine. And we should
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.440]   basically get our backs up over that the Monroe doctrine states
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.640]   that no disengraved power can bring troops, weapons or bases
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.920]   into the Western Hemisphere. United States spent over 100
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.120]   years basically enforcing Monroe doctrine, it would greatly
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.400]   diminish us security, if we allowed any foreign great power
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.200]   to have troops in the Western Hemisphere. So we deserve to
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.920]   have our horns out over that the problem is that we have our
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.320]   horns out over everything. And so we're not really taken
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.760]   seriously. We've cried wolf so many times. I don't think we're
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.600]   really taken seriously by the Chinese on this. And this should
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.080]   be a teaching moment to the foreign policy establishment,
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.440]   because this is Russia's objection. Russia's objection
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.720]   is to having American troops, weapons and bases directly on
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.960]   their border. This is our objection to what China is
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   seeking to do in Cuba.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.160]   Okay, Brad, you want to add something to that? Or can we
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.360]   move to
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.000]   code? Just real quickly, I would say, yeah, there's a real
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.320]   appetite in the business community to be engaged this
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.920]   idea that we're going to decouple the world never have to
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.360]   deal with these folks, right is just a farce. ByteDance bought a
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.640]   billion dollars worth of Nvidia chips announced this week,
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   right? Like, like the world is entangled. And I think we would
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.160]   be better off having our political and business leaders
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.600]   in more sync over how to achieve this long term safety and
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.440]   prosperity, as opposed to what feels like a disjointed foreign
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.560]   policy relative to the global reality around AI and, and
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.880]   what's happening on the business front.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.200]   I agree. Well said, yeah. And I mean, it's just so obvious, why
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.160]   can't we be collaborating on stuff? And we see when you and I
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.400]   made our trip to the UAE. And then we see the Saudis, you
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.640]   know, bringing movies back, we have certain regions, we're
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.840]   doing a pretty good job of engaging with engagement. You
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.960]   know, reasonable engagement is a good idea.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.840]   It's because and I think RFK has said this, we have created a
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.560]   very dangerous revolving door between our most critical
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.080]   institutions and the largest industrial companies in the
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.440]   United States. And that revolving door creates all kinds
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.960]   of conflicts of interest. And those things get sorted out via
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.440]   revenue and dollars and profits, incentives. And so those
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.600]   incentives will drive us if it's the military industrial complex
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.400]   to go to war. And you're seeing that it'll complicate our foreign
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.360]   policy. So this is why I've always said, the most important
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.000]   thing that we're doing is something that the military
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.080]   industrial complex cannot stop, which is our energy
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.440]   independence. And when you have energy independence and abundant
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.600]   costless energy, I do think that the biggest thing you get is
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.080]   this peace dividend, you stop fighting these wars, you become
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.680]   much more rational abroad. And you're like, Okay, I don't need
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.600]   to fight with all of these people. Because, you know,
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.480]   things are so great within our borders.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.040]   You're so right, because we actually have stopped those
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.480]   wars. And now we've created two other ones, Russia, Ukraine, we
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.680]   can't help on China. What's that?
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.720]   We can't help ourselves. And we'll use the scarcity of
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.360]   commodities as a boogeyman to basically incentivize us to go
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.680]   in these foreign misadventures. And it really has to stop, by
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.160]   the way, just two quick points on that on Taiwan, there's an
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.840]   election next year. And it looks like right now that the pro
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.800]   China party might actually take power right now the party that's
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.640]   in power is more of a pro Western Party. And the reason I
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.960]   think is that the Taiwanese are looking at what's going on in
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.520]   Ukraine. And they're looking at the corpses of the Ukrainian
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.240]   youth pile up. And they're thinking maybe it's not such a
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   great idea to be an American proxy state. Or in the words of
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   Henry Kissinger, he wants quip that it's dangerous to be an
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.040]   American enemy, but it's absolutely fatal to be an
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.520]   American friend. I think that this war may be backfiring in
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.760]   terms of the incentives is creating around Taiwan.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.640]   Remember, Biden said that this war would basically help protect
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:01.960]   Taiwan by deterring China, it might actually deter Taiwan from
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.480]   opposing China. So we'll have to see how that plays out.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.400]   All an able bodied person in Taiwan, a voting age needs to
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.080]   do is read the newspaper and understand it in the last two
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.200]   and a half years, we've essentially started a
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.040]   multitrillion dollar program to deliver ourselves from all the
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.200]   critical resources that China and Taiwan gives us. And so if
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.560]   you're a Taiwanese citizen, the writing is unfortunately on the
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.440]   wall, which is that we are giving ourselves the
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.760]   optionality to not have to do anything. So to your point,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.920]   David, if you're a rational, thinking Taiwanese person,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.440]   unfortunately, you're forced to be in a position where you may
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.080]   have to head your bets. And if the United States can basically
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.640]   have chip supply that comes from Europe and Mexico, now all of a
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.960]   sudden, the criticality of TSMC goes away. To wit, I publish this
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:51.840]   tweet yesterday about Buffett and his trades in Japan, right,
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.000]   he bought these five trading companies. And so just a really
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.320]   novel carry trade that I've really fallen in love with just
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.240]   understanding it. But the kodak to that is that when he did
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.840]   this, and going long Japan, what he actually also did was he
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.280]   delivered himself from China, he had a long position in TSMC. And
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.520]   he said, I'm out. And when they asked him why he sold TSMC, he
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.760]   said, this is a very complicated thing. And he basically said
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.600]   that it's not a bet that's worth making. And I think underneath
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.440]   that, if I had to guess what he's trying to say about Taiwan
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.680]   indirectly, through his sale of TSMC is the odds are that we are
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.280]   not going to get into a land war over there, which means that
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.920]   that asset and its equity value is in danger, and I don't want
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.880]   to own it. And I think that that's a very clinical summation
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.240]   of his rational action. So to your point,
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.360]   well, here's what Blinken said speak with their dog. I think
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.600]   this is very important. You know, the one China policy says
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.280]   Taiwan is part of China. It's not an independent country. But
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.440]   we've had a very ambiguous and tolerance for this ambiguity of
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.920]   Taiwan acting as its own nation, while saying we support the one
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.640]   China policy. And that ambiguity has served us very well in the
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.960]   China relationship. Here's a blanket set at the press
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.560]   conference, quote, we do not support Taiwan independence, we
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.560]   either side. The status quo he's referring to here, Brad is that
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.320]   they get to be independent in Taiwan. But we don't say they're
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.360]   independent. They are obviously acting in an independent manner.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.600]   But it is not our business to tell the Taiwanese people that
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.960]   they're independent or not. It's their decision to determine if
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.640]   they're independent or not. Any thoughts on the trade by Buffett
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.040]   and Blinken? I think that last comment at the press conference
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:40.840]   and this ambiguity,
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.200]   I think we want to maintain the ambiguity, I think we're
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:49.920]   basically saying to China, don't change the status quo, at least
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.680]   for now. Right? While we rebuild these chip fabs in Arizona and
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.600]   other parts of the world, I think most of the wealthy
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.560]   families I've talked to, from Taiwan believe that five or six
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.160]   years from now, the US will no longer be in the position where
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.520]   they will need Taiwan and Taipei as much as they do today. And
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.200]   they're worried
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.960]   you think it will take to be independent, say it one more
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.640]   time and explain it.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.840]   Well, it's not about being independent. It's how much
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.960]   longer will Taiwan have what they believe to be de facto
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.320]   protection from the United States. And I was told by one
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:30.120]   very influential Taiwanese family that they believe when
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.600]   the fifth chip fab comes online in Arizona, which I think is
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.880]   scheduled for 25 or 26, they intended to have most of their
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.040]   family members out of Taiwan at that period in time. Now, I
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.760]   think most Taiwanese don't envision this being, you know, a
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.160]   violent invasion of Taiwan, it's more of a take under in the same
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:56.840]   way that Hong Kong was. And so I don't see an American president
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.520]   frankly going to war, nor would I want them to go to war over
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.080]   Taiwan. But I think it's in all of our interest to maintain that
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.400]   status quo, which is why taunting the Chinese over the
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.800]   course of the past few years over Taiwan has seemed like a
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.040]   policy that's not fit with our goals.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.440]   Right? Well, if you look at skin in the game, the fact that the
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.240]   chips act went through so quickly, the fact that Warren
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.760]   Buffett, as you pointed out, Schmott made his bet. And this
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.360]   family that has obviously, you know, skin in the game, quite
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.000]   literally, are making these decisions. I think we know where
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.680]   this is headed, you can just follow the bets. And if you look
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.640]   at the bets in five years, dollars, follow the dollars, I
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.200]   mean, and also where people put themselves, geographically,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.520]   everybody left Hong Kong, when the turnover happened or before
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.880]   it, they went to Singapore, they went to UAE, they voted with
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.200]   their feet and their dollars. And that's obviously what's
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.160]   going to happen here. This is a good pivot. Because this
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.880]   criticism of the Ukraine policy by Matt, that sacks pointed out
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.800]   came because there is a belief on his part and others, that the
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:09.320]   pod here, all in, is putting its unilateral support behind RFK.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.360]   And that is not true. There are two people on the pod, who
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:18.080]   hosted a fundraiser last week. And here is what Matt
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.400]   incorrectly said, because I have not put my support behind RFK. I
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.880]   think he's very interesting, and I'm glad he's in the race. And
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   neither has Friedberg, but Schmock and sacks did host one
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.200]   and I'll hand it over to them. But here's what Matt said in his
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.760]   sub stack. And even though it's not the subject of this post, I
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.160]   do want to say that I think it's really sleazy and gross for the
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.920]   hosts of the all in podcast to be engaging in this Kennedy
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.120]   booster ism as a bang shot way of harming Joe Biden's
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.440]   reelection prospects, notwithstanding the recent
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.520]   convergence around Russia policy, Kennedy represents
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.560]   precisely the strand of progressive thought that right
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.480]   of center business people have highly have rightly spent the
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.400]   better part of the century bemoaning his is an anti
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.040]   progress anti technology, ultimately anti human worldview
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.560]   that stands against biomedical progress, against progress and
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:09.840]   against
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.200]   the guy who wants to blow up as many Ukrainians as possible as
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.440]   an old lead. Yeah, exactly. This is anti human. Listen, I don't
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.080]   even think we should be giving him this much time.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.200]   Well, no, but I think it is important that because people
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.720]   now have connected this pod with the rise of RFK. This was the
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.000]   first
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.920]   major either. What a glacey Iglesias is accusing us somehow
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.480]   of do of supporting RFK not because of issues, but somehow
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.920]   because it's a bang shot for Donald Trump, which is
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.040]   ridiculous. None of us support Donald Trump. He's not even my
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.320]   preferred candidate in the Republican lane.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.080]   Well, what he said was a bang shot against Biden, just to be
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:44.360]   clear.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.080]   I would prefer I prefer your against. I prefer RFK to Biden.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.760]   It's that simple. What's what's wrong with that? He's not even
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.360]   making any arguments here. Look, we've explained in a lot of
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.040]   detail. And I explained in my response, all the issues where I
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.160]   support RFK supports free speech over censorship, he supports
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.440]   civil liberties over the surveillance state. He supports
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.920]   peace instead of war. He supports sealing the southern
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.800]   border virtually alone among Democrats and talking sense on
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.320]   that issue. And I believe that he's completely correctly
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.440]   diagnosed what we're doing in Ukraine. So on the
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.440]   issue, disagree with him on some issues, right? You disagree with
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.280]   him on nuclear, and you may disagree with him and his
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.800]   anti-vax stance, if he is in fact anti-vax.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.320]   I just hold on, let's finish those.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.600]   I think he was right about COVID lockdowns. And I think he was
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.160]   right about right COVID, the so called COVID shot that wasn't
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.840]   even a vaccine that that should not have been required.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.320]   But what about those two issues? You obviously disagree with him
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.360]   on some things. Do you disagree with him on his anti-vax stuff
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.480]   and his nuclear stuff?
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.640]   I don't know enough about those issues to have like a firm
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.720]   stance. What I would say is that every candidate represents a
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:57.120]   bundle of issues. And you support the ones who are aligned
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.520]   with you on the issues that are most important to you, on the
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.160]   issues that are most important to me, which are these
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.440]   questions, the great questions of war and peace, and the
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.800]   questions of free speech and censorship. And even I would say
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.880]   the question of the economy and who do we prioritize, because he
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.840]   wants to prioritize the middle class. On those big questions, I
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.560]   feel like I'm aligned with RFK. Perfect. So that's why I support
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.760]   him. Let me go to China. By the way, do you think Jack Dorsey is
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:28.960]   is supporting RFK as a bank shot something or other? No, he's
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.960]   supporting it because he agrees to RFK on these questions of war
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.240]   and peace. Okay. And free speech.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   Great. I'm just letting everybody be very clear about
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.320]   their position since this is becoming the support of RFK by
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.800]   this podcast, or two of the four people in the podcast is now
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.200]   becoming kind of national news.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.680]   Iglesias is even making any arguments here. He's just
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.640]   applying derogatory labels to us. Yeah, what this is, this is
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.920]   a disciplinary tactic or a shaming tactic. Yes, by the
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.200]   sort of enforcers for the establishment, right? Want to
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.480]   prevent independent thinkers from stepping out a line. I
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.640]   agree. That's what this is about.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.560]   It looks like this outsider went to the Dalton School, University.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.480]   So there you have it.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.600]   Yeah, you got a $2 million education doesn't know what a
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.560]   basis point is.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.480]   He's the guy with the basis points, right?
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.720]   Good luck with your substat.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.320]   My god,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.120]   Chamath, you are pro nuclear. You've been very clear about
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.920]   that. Although you're pro renewables. Mostly, you've been
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.400]   clear about that on this podcast, and many conversations
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   I've had with you. You are also pro vaccine, but you're anti
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.920]   what happened with the lockdown. So maybe you could expand upon
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.880]   your support of RFK, why you held a fundraiser for him and
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.480]   what things you agree with him on and maybe what things you
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.960]   don't necessarily agree with him on?
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:51.240]   Well, first, I actually did what I think a lot of people haven't
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.760]   done, which is just listen to him just stop talking. zip the
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.600]   old yapper. And there is an enormous amount of long form
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.880]   content where you can really understand where he stands on
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.800]   some of these topics. He's right about the war on Ukraine, we
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:17.040]   shouldn't be in. He's right about free speech, which is we
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:25.200]   should have it. He's right that the COVID vaccine was not a
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.320]   vaccine. And really what it's done is actually discredit the
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.200]   word vaccine, unfortunately, in a lot of people's minds. He
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.920]   actually is a person that is pro vaccine for all these other
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.720]   vaccines. He himself is vaccinated, his children are
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.060]   vaccinated. You would all know this stuff. If you just took two
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.760]   minutes to just listen to it. He is against the COVID vaccine.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.340]   And what I would say is, I'm very sympathetic to that. I'm
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.240]   very sympathetic to the job the FDA had to do. And I think they
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.920]   generally did do a great job. But we ran something through and
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.760]   we allowed it to be labeled a word that misappropriates what
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.280]   it is. It's not a vaccine. And the problem with that is that it
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.000]   now makes people mistrust the measles, mumps and rubella
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.720]   vaccine. That's crazy. You shouldn't mistrust the MMR
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.680]   vaccine or DTAP. But because those things are lumped in with
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.240]   the same thing as a COVID vaccine that is at best 30 or 40%
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.400]   efficacious. We have these problems. He calls that out
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:34.460]   pretty honestly. So I like the fact that he actually speaks in
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.740]   nuance. I like the fact that when I listened to him, I find
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:45.380]   that the talking head think police are generally lying. It
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:49.220]   confirms what I believe about them. Because he just says
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:54.440]   things in a very plain spoken, intelligent way. And I think
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.380]   that there are a lot of folks who don't want to think who want
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:02.660]   to be given the simple answer, who want to just reject what he
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.480]   stands for and just take the establishment view in the hopes
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.780]   that they'll get, I don't know, maybe accepted by the
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:13.300]   establishment, the establishment just wants to curate power. And
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.800]   I just think that people should be thinking for themselves. If
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.320]   you listen to the Rogan podcast, if you listen to the Jordan
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.940]   Peterson podcast, there are millions and millions and
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.580]   millions of links and page views and discussions and thoughts.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.180]   And there's probably 1000s of minutes of RFK explaining what
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.180]   he thinks on basically any topic you can imagine, you can get to
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.740]   your own conclusion. And I think what I think you'll find and
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:42.580]   this is true for me is there's 10% of stuff you are just the
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:47.260]   he immensely supportive of 70% of stuff that's like quite
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:51.980]   reasonable and fair. And then there's the rest, which is a
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.100]   spectrum of things I disagree with. But then you're left with
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.980]   a blended expected value where you're like, man, this guy is
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   really better than all the other alternatives. Brad, I'll let you
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.460]   go. And then I'll give my position.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:08.380]   What I find most insidious about the opposition to this
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.140]   discussion is people are upset that you're not swearing an
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.700]   allegiance to a dogmatism. Right? The truth of the matter
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:22.620]   is this group has hosted dinners for Ro Khanna. For Senator
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:27.580]   Manchin. We've hosted dinners for DeSantis. Right? Had I been
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.660]   here, I would have put my name on the dinner for Kennedy
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.260]   because I want to gather information. I'm an analyst, I
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:40.340]   want to think for myself, how can we spend trillions and put
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.980]   ourselves into potentially harm's way without having a
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:49.580]   real conversation in Congress and on these pods about the risk
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:55.060]   of war? Why can't we have an authentic postmortem about the
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.820]   efficacy of the COVID vaccine without being shame? The
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.940]   revolution going on in this country, which is fantastic, from
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:06.660]   my perspective, is that there is no longer a monopolistic control
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.980]   over the discussion. And that's why this podcast and this
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.460]   friendship, and the conversation we all had here is resonating
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:19.020]   with people because they also want to hear all the different
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.940]   sides because most people are capable are way smarter than the
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.140]   elites on the coast thing. You know, I'm from Indiana, lots of
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.100]   smart folks who think for themselves in Indiana, but
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.620]   they're told told by coastal elites what to think. And they
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.580]   reject this. And that's what you're seeing in this discussion
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.020]   and so many of these others. It's not about that. It's not
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   about vaccines. It's not about a war. It's about their control
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.340]   over how you think and them wanting to force you to swear to
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.220]   an orthodoxy.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.300]   I think that's really well said.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.140]   Yeah, yeah, that is well said. But the way they try to control
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:58.500]   what you think is by labeling candidates so as to exclude
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.820]   them or make them sound crazy. So J Cal, I mean, you kind of
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.380]   introduced RFK as an anti Vaxxer. I don't think that is
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.860]   the correct way to describe his position, or the singular way
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.900]   that he should be labeled.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.100]   No, I don't. I don't believe that I said, Here are the things
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.580]   he believes that we agree with. And then I gave the things that
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.740]   the media is saying, you know, so I was trying to present the
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.420]   totality of it. And I said, he is obviously in favor of the
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.260]   middle class and all this stuff. So I want to be clear on my
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:31.500]   position here. So I am in support of vibrant, long form
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.980]   debate like we have here. And I'm in support of anybody who
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.780]   takes on the establishment, because there are crazy
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.140]   incentives as we talk about here, incentives matter. And we
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.820]   are long overdue for discussion on vaccines. But it's very
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.860]   important that everybody understand here that everybody
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.020]   on this podcast took the COVID vaccine. And everybody here, our
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.140]   kids have been vaccinated. It's not a vaccine. Exactly. So they
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:54.740]   took the
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:59.980]   experimental mRNA treatment because we got hoodwinked by the
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.780]   media into thinking it would prevent us from ever getting
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   COVID which it did not do. I think I got
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:12.260]   vaccines are good. And the COVID thing was not very good.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.740]   And it reduced death in older people and probably was the only
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.500]   group of people and we'll we'll know when we do a postmortem.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.860]   But do not
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.540]   have this mRNA like flowing through our bodies, who knows,
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.580]   it might be a time bomb.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.420]   Well, and then for people who are wondering, like if we
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.580]   should even be having these discussions, the hypocrisy of
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.300]   the media, I think is very important to look at here
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.460]   because the media is gonna be attacking this podcast over and
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.020]   over again, not that it matters. But when we moved into the top
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:46.340]   100 top 50 top 10. That's when the knives came out. And I would
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:51.140]   like to remind the media of the long history of investigative
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:55.860]   journalism and debates what was once a conspiracy theory often
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.260]   goes on to win a Pulitzer Prize. And, you know, the hypocrisy
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.420]   here is crazy. Because if you look at some of the greatest
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.460]   stories and investigative journalists pieces, they started
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.060]   with these debates, rumors, etc. Abu grab. That was the New
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:15.340]   Yorker. Ralph Nader reporting that was supporting and he can't
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.620]   now they're right, they can't get the time of day for his
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:22.300]   report on who really destroyed Nordstrom, the Catholic Church
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.300]   sex scandal, the Boston Globe, the mainstream media does not
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.460]   perform the function that you're describing anymore. They act as
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.860]   the bodyguard for the elite for the establishment. They
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.220]   actually have even a layer of stenographers for the people in
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.700]   power. Not exactly true. They have actually done incredible
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.980]   reporting, but there is a group of them which is towing the
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.540]   party line because you have the New York Times in their expose
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:49.500]   on the taxi commission that won a Pulitzer in 2020. And then you
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.940]   look at apps. I know you don't follow Pulitzers or
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.220]   investigative journalism in 2020. Brian Rosenthal at the New
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.820]   York Times did a massive expose on the predatory New York City
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.660]   taxi industry. And that
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.580]   there's a few other issues that might be more important to the
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.060]   nation. It was an example of protectionism and rent seeking
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.860]   the Enron scandal, big tobacco 60 minutes. What about the
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.540]   pretzel monopoly in the south part of the Bronx? What about
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.860]   that hot dog vendor on? You guys are uninformed. didn't have all
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.500]   those licenses up to date. I thought there was a whole lot
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.980]   about the big expose on that. You guys are the fact is at the
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.300]   same time that the New York Times CNN were attacking what
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:38.580]   Uber was doing. The New York Times won a fucking Pulitzer for
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.940]   their coverage of predatory loans by rich, powerful people
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.060]   right in New York City.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.500]   I bet they also did a great story on the guy selling
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.220]   trinkets outside Penn Station without a license. He was a man
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.300]   of the people like yourselves actually should actually be more
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.060]   informed. Okay, well, what they should be reporting on, for
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.340]   example, but if they really, if the Pulitzers work the way they
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.220]   should, is where patient zero came from on COVID.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.740]   Because Michael Schoenberg just reported this over the last
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.020]   weekend, it got picked up by the Wall Street Journal, that
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:13.900]   patient zero, it turns out, was a researcher at the lab, who was
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.780]   performing gain of function research. Yeah, shocker. Another
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.860]   conspiracy theory proven true,
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.780]   and will wind up being a Pulitzer.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   He deserves a Pulitzer.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.460]   He does. And the crazy thing about this quote unquote
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.820]   conspiracy theory turned out to be true is like it brought
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:35.220]   together the most odd bedfellows Rand Paul and john Stewart, when
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.300]   rank Paul and john Stewart can be in a room and agree on
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.660]   basically the totality of a topic, we should all just pay
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.580]   attention because it's not it's not a normal world in which
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:49.300]   these guys would otherwise get along. Right. And both of them
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.820]   nailed it from day one,
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.980]   right to have the same name. But now connect the dots further.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.820]   Okay, why was the truth suppressed? Why did it not come
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:02.100]   out? Because Fauci had funded gain of function research at the
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:07.820]   Wuhan lab via EcoHealth Alliance. So he knew that if at
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.620]   the beginning of this pandemic, it turned out that he had been
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.460]   partially responsible for the creation of this virus that had
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.340]   now turned into a pandemic around the world, his career
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.220]   would have been over
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:24.060]   and it's worse. It's even worse than that. 46% of the
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:28.860]   advertising on TV news comes from farm and we did not always
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.020]   allow pharma spending. And this is may not be one to one, it may
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:37.940]   not be that a specific person doing a report at CNN or Fox or
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.060]   any of the networks is saying, Oh, I'm going to lose my job if
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.300]   I write something critical of pharma, but they're not doing
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.460]   the investigative pieces on I can tell you this on the people
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:51.020]   who have 46% of their advertising revenue, unless it
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.100]   really, you know, gets to the final inning on something and
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.260]   right and that is something that we need to question, right? The
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:05.980]   media is funded 46% by pharma companies, and pharma companies
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.580]   were given a pass. And if you criticize any of the pharma
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.020]   companies, the media is going to come for you. And so listen, I'm
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.420]   not a tinfoil, but you do have a
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.620]   lot of oil. Listen, the media is funded by big pharma and its
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.260]   primary sources are these high level government employees who
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.460]   have been there forever, who leak them information. That is
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.580]   why the New York Times was carrying water for Fauci and big
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.740]   pharma. This is the marriage of state power and corporate greed
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.820]   that RFK Jr denounces. Yeah.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:40.900]   Well, there you have it, folks. So and he believes he could be
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.420]   assassinated by the CIA.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.860]   No, he didn't say it like that.
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.820]   He didn't say it like that. He was asked what what is his
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:51.740]   strategy on campaigning and all of that stuff? And he said,
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.100]   Look, I'm going to do as much as possible. But one thing that
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.180]   I'm going to avoid are like these open air parades just
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   because there's just a lot of folks that we can't control
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.660]   crowd control. Yeah. Okay. Reasonable.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.180]   Yeah, I mean, the conversation on Rogan went something like
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.820]   this. Rogan was asking questions about the Kennedy assassinations
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:16.580]   and RFK believes like something like 60% of the American public
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   believes that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. Then Rogan
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.580]   asked him, well, do you ever feel afraid? Running for office?
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.100]   And his answer was basically no, not really. It's not something
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.540]   that I'm preoccupied with. But yeah, I'll take precautions.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.220]   Does that mean he thinks the CIA is going to assassinate him? No,
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.820]   that's not what he said. But that is how the media reported
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:39.980]   it, including Fox News that became the soundbite.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.780]   Well, the soundbite from this podcast was that he believes his
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.580]   uncle was and his father were that the CIA was involved.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.940]   I don't believe that Jason, a lot of people.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.300]   I am not giving my opinion. I'm giving his opinion on it. He said
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.700]   it on this podcast, and the CIA won't release all the
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.340]   information to this day, even though they've been commanded to
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.500]   do so. So make your own decision, folks. According to
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.060]   Bloomberg, there is a ton of action for startup shares in
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:05.340]   secondary markets. If you don't know what a secondary market is.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.060]   That's when one investor buys shares in a company that's not
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.380]   yet public directly from another investors on the cap table. So
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.740]   if stripe which is not yet public or Reddit, there are
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.140]   shares floating around in those companies, either previous
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.060]   employees or previous investors, one firm might see an
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:24.420]   opportunity there and buy them. As this process of bottoming out
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:28.140]   has occurred, pitch book reported, Tiger Global told
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.540]   secondary investors and that's a class of people who like to buy
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.020]   these, that they could bid on any individual private company
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.860]   in its portfolio. They tried to sell a bundle of these shares,
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.300]   about 30 startups at a time. But they couldn't find buyers
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.180]   according to the reports. So now they're allowing people to bid
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.660]   on per company on a per company basis. Some of these are being
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:52.740]   marked down a third 50%, etc. Here's the quote from
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.060]   Bloomberg, as of May 31 shares of startups were trading at a
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.300]   median discount of 61% compared to valuations at their latest
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.580]   funding rounds, according to report by forge global holdings.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.860]   A 16, according to the report is actively buying shares in
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.500]   secondary Excel Bain Bessemer Kleiner are also using secondary
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.300]   to grow stakes in their existing investments doubling down. As it
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.660]   were crossover firms like cotu Tiger grow global. And even
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.100]   Brad's altimeter are actively searching for deals. So Brad,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.500]   your thoughts on this is this sign of a bottom? And why are
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.380]   you doing this? It's
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.980]   Yeah, it is. It is true. I mean, our job is to look at all these
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.940]   companies understand their value. Okay, you know, I'm
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.340]   sitting here looking at a list that I was given this morning
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:39.580]   125 companies secondary, you know, the Goldman Sachs
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:45.100]   unprofitable tech index in the public markets is down 64% as of
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:45.580]   this one,
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.540]   unprofitable public,
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.900]   they put together a basket, they track unprofitable public
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:55.860]   companies down 64% off of its peak as as of this morning. So
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.060]   you just quoted the Bloomberg article saying, yeah, these
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.940]   unprofitable tech companies in the private markets are down
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:06.580]   about 60 61%. That smells right to me. The repricing have to
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:12.060]   occur. These have to occur. Right? There are 1400 unicorns
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:16.820]   at the end of 2022. And 100% of them will likely do a down run.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.980]   And if you said what is the average that they're going to be
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:24.580]   down? It's over 50%. You saw the repricing out of some of the
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.340]   best ones, like a canva or a stripe where it was down, let's
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:32.220]   call it 30 4050%. But you know, they're going to be companies
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.300]   like in the public markets that are down 80 or 90% and
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.020]   disappear altogether. So we didn't see the repricings. Okay.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:44.700]   And by the way, when we say, you know, that article quotes,
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:50.140]   forge, that is what the sellers are offering to sell shares for.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:55.780]   That is not where transactions are clearing. Right? So why has
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.740]   an altimeter purchased any of this because the prices aren't
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.820]   low enough to induce me to get off the sidelines to purchase
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:05.620]   the shares, but we're within kind of, you know, we're
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:09.900]   starting to get in the zone where we can underwrite to a
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.500]   margin of safety competitive or better than the public markets
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.020]   for companies that we think are great companies. Now out of
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:20.820]   those 414 100 unicorns at the end of 22, there are probably
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.060]   less than 5% of those companies I would even want to own at the
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:29.380]   right price. Right? So it's a small subset of companies, the
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.900]   price has to get to this clearing point. But you know, I
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.060]   think over the course of the next 18 months, we're going to
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.940]   see an acceleration of market clearing events as these
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.140]   companies need to raise capital as their employees want to get
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.460]   liquid on shares. And it's probably see some great
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:51.140]   opportunities. But most of these things that get put on sale
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.460]   should not be purchased, right? Most of them, even you know, the
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.740]   first sale price is never the last sale price, the markdown
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.500]   on the black t shirts will continue.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:04.300]   Tomatha sacks, any thoughts? Are you buying in secondary? Are
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.220]   you looking at this? Yeah,
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.900]   we'll look at secondary deals. It's not primarily what we do,
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.820]   but we're open to it. But Brad, if you were to categorize the
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.420]   1400 unicorns into one of three categories, what do you think
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.060]   the percentages would be those three categories being zombie
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:22.580]   corns, like unicorn companies that just don't deserve to
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.620]   exist in our product market fit, they're going to go away.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.620]   Category two would be viable companies that are just over
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.220]   pricing are headed for a down round. And the number three
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.500]   would be the ones that are actually headed for an up round.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.300]   Yeah, I'd say 30 to 40% are these companies that were valued
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.620]   over a billion dollars that don't have product market fit,
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.540]   they'll disappear.
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:46.100]   zombie companies that will disappear.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:50.860]   Right. And listen, just just to be fair, let's explain. Most of
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:55.820]   these companies, right have less than 200 million of preference,
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:59.820]   preferred shares that venture capitalists invest into the
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:03.980]   company. And many of those companies in that 30 40%. There's
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.900]   a team, there's some asset of value, they may be able to, you
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.020]   know, sell the talent of the team and recoup, David, let's
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.420]   call it 30 40% of the prep stack, right in that
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.900]   transaction, we're starting to see some of those occur. Then I
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.700]   think the lion's share of the companies that are left, let's
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:27.660]   call it, you know, another 40%. These are companies that should
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.860]   never have been marked at these prices, right, but they do have
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:34.260]   a business, and they're going to be marked down, you know, 50 to
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.300]   80%. But all of the like, none of those have been able to grow
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:42.220]   through it, then there's less than 10% of the companies,
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.820]   right, whose growth has been so robust through this period, that
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:51.300]   they've actually grown into or within 10 15% of those prior
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:55.900]   prices. And if you do all of that work, it puts us back on
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.820]   trendline. Right. The only thing unusual here is how far off
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:05.980]   trendline we had 1400 unicorns, right in 2020. We had I think
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.820]   145 IPOs. In the last two years, we've had four. Okay, so there
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.780]   is a huge backlog. These companies aren't getting public
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.420]   why because public market buyers, like ourselves, we're
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.940]   not willing to pay the prices that were in the private
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:24.540]   market. So the first step is to just have these clearing events.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:28.260]   And it's David, you and I heard sober talk over the course of
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:31.060]   the last couple of days, I think they, you know, said to the
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.020]   founders very clearly, you need to sell your businesses or you
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.500]   need to get profitable. There is no middle ground.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.860]   In other news, Ford has been issued a conditional $9.2
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.860]   billion loan from the US Department of Energy to build
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.780]   out 3123 EV battery factories specific alone is coming through
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:51.900]   the Department of Energy's LPO. That's the loan programs office
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.780]   got about 400 billion to lend out. You might remember this
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:17:01.820]   from 2010 when they gave cylindra a 123 batteries, which
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.340]   eventually went bankrupt and got bought by a Chinese company, I
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:08.260]   believe, and Tesla, a $465 million loan, Tesla paid it
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.620]   back. The other two didn't test payback with interest. Jigar
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.900]   Shah, the director of the loan program office described the
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.700]   lending moves as a way to onshore and reshore
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:22.340]   manufacturing. The goal of the program is not innovation, but
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:26.900]   to get more of the supply chain to be manufactured in the US
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:31.740]   guests. Some people are criticizing this just out of the
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.100]   gate with why should we be giving these loans to companies
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.380]   shouldn't this be the private sector doing it? What are your
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.380]   thoughts here? Is this a good idea? A great idea? Neutral
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.700]   idea? It's a great idea.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.820]   Spline, it's us using our balance sheet to make sure that
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.180]   we get to energy independence. So this is actually a perfect
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:57.020]   role for government. It's shaping incentives so that
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.420]   capitalism can do its job. What this does for Ford is Ford has a
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:07.220]   partnership with SK. And so SK has a lot of capability in Korea,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.500]   but they can bring that know how now, domestically on short of
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.140]   the United States, you'll be hiring 1000s of people, you'll
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.940]   be building battery factories, or it needs batteries, their
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.660]   forecast is they'll be selling two and a half million electric
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:23.340]   vehicles by 2026 2027. So whatever Ford does, you can
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:27.460]   expect GM will also do you can expect all of the other big
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.860]   companies to do so this is all just great. And at the end of
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:35.340]   the day, for people to not over this is 9.8 billion, I guess it
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.380]   sounds like a lot, but we're probably spending $9.8 billion
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.100]   a day fighting wars. So this is a day of just taking a pause
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.380]   on all these dumb wars, and actually becoming energy
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:53.460]   reliant, carbon neutral, fixing the climate. It's great jobs,
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:57.020]   energy independence and less dependency on autocratic
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.900]   nations. It seems like good idea.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.980]   Everything should be how about instead of thinking about it in
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:06.260]   terms of wars, let's think about it in terms of so if the the DOD
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:13.220]   budget is $800 billion, okay, per year, what is that 2.6
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:18.660]   billion a day 2.7 billion a day. Okay, so we're talking about
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.500]   three days, four days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.180]   you want to say
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:30.180]   private should be doing I agree with your mouth about the wars.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.980]   But this is all money we don't have. I mean, we shouldn't be
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:35.420]   spending the money on wars. And we shouldn't be spending it, I
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.220]   think, on industrial policy. So first of all, one of our friends
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.500]   who's an energy investor, we should keep his name, but was
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:46.740]   telling me that the energy subsidies that were in the, you
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.980]   know, misnamed inflation reduction act, it is like the
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:54.980]   biggest bonanza of all time. He said that the energy sector is
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:59.420]   going crazy now trying to figure out how to exploit these
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.900]   incentives. And his view is that although I think it was supposed
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.500]   to cost about $350 billion, he thought that it would ultimately
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.620]   cost the government somewhere around a trillion, because the
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.900]   way these subsidies work is that you just qualify for them. And
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.060]   then you get the subsidy. It's not like the credits run out. So
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.460]   if you qualify, you get it. So this could end up costing the
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.140]   government way more than what was originally projected. And so
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.580]   the question is, what are you going to get for all this money?
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.060]   And in this article on Ford, they were talking about these
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:34.780]   7000 jobs are being created at a cost of $440,000 per job. So
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:38.020]   it's great that the jobs are being created. But if you look
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:42.060]   at the efficiency of that, that spend per job doesn't really
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.820]   make sense.
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.860]   I don't understand how you get that number. You take the
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:50.060]   article said it, the article said for 440,000. Do you take
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.540]   9.8 billion and divided by 7,000? What do you do?
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.860]   I'm just quoting that paragraph of the article. So yeah, so the
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.060]   job creation is good. But you got to look at the efficiency of
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.540]   the job creation. The other thing is, the question I would
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.900]   ask you guys actually is, who wants one of these Ford EVs? Do
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.340]   you want an EV by Ford?
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.740]   I think there are a lot of people that drive a Ford pickup
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.700]   truck. We talked about this before. So that's one 50s coming.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:19.340]   Yeah. Very popular. There was a an article in the Wall Street
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.940]   Journal a few months ago, which talked about the brand
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.140]   consideration cycle that has been going on. And there was a
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.980]   large look, we're friends with Elon, but we should acknowledge
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.180]   there's a large number of people that are frankly a little bit
[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.100]   turned off by him. And they've been very clear that they want
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.220]   an alternative to Tesla because they don't want to buy Tesla
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.820]   because they don't necessarily prefer him as a brand ambassador
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:45.180]   for their car. And the reality of life is that even if you're
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.380]   like maximally incredible, unless you find some clever way
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.980]   of creating a monopoly, in which case you can be a douche or
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:56.860]   evil, you're only ever going to capture 30 plus 40% maybe have a
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:00.020]   market Coke, Pepsi is a good example. And so there's always
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:03.260]   going to be long tail alternatives. And, you know, I
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.140]   had a chance, for example, in Vegas to drive a Rivian, I was
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.860]   surprised at the quality or drive in a Rivian, I was
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.420]   surprised at the quality of Rivian only because I've been so
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:15.340]   focused on Tesla my whole life. So yeah, I think there are a lot
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.860]   of people that will buy Ford's doesn't well take anything away
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.580]   from what he wants doing. But I do think there are a lot of
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:20.340]   people that will buy it.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.020]   My problem with industrial policy is this, you think about
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.260]   that EV summit that the White House did, they didn't even
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.660]   invite Elon. And that that was for political reasons, union
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:32.140]   reasons. Yeah, partly because of his views on speech, but I think
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.380]   mostly because he's not a union shop. And so that's the real
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.940]   reason why Ford is being doled out this sort of nine point
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.900]   something billion dollar loan is because they're politically
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:47.620]   connected with the right people in this current administration.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:50.140]   And that's the problem with industrial policy is that the
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.020]   money gets handed out by government to the politically
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.740]   connected in this case, as opposed to the companies that
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740]   may be producing the best products.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.300]   The fact is Tesla did get one of these loans in 2010 when it was
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.340]   a very nascent company. So you got to give them some credit.
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.500]   They took a big risk there.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.420]   But let's think about that for a second. Okay, because I know
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.740]   that example comes up a lot.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.780]   And a 123 and cylinder.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:13.700]   Yeah. So Elon was basically a fluke. I mean, you get like a
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.900]   once in a generation entrepreneur who happened to be
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.700]   working on this EV problem, and he got that loan. If you're to
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.460]   take Elon out of that government portfolio, it all looks like
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.460]   Solyndra. Yep. So the question is, like, what is this
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.540]   portfolio going to look like? Is there really gonna be another
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:32.660]   Elon in there? Because if not, there's gonna be a lot of
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.380]   cylinders.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.700]   But even if they break even,
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.380]   there's gonna be a lot of subsidies to companies like
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.620]   Ford, which are politically connected. And I think a point
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.580]   freeberg would make if he were here, is that at some point,
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.300]   you're gonna have to turn off the subsidies because we can't
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.660]   afford it. And then at that point, is that factory gonna be
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:53.060]   self sufficient? Brad, you want to you've heard the two sides of
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:53.500]   the story here?
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:58.260]   And listen, while generally against industrial policy, I
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:01.380]   come down on Chema side, I think this is a once in a generation
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:07.260]   opportunity to reduce our national security, risk profile
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.300]   and to achieve what is really a national security imperative,
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.580]   which is energy independence. It's not going to happen just
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:18.620]   according to the invisible hand of the market. We see our
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:21.980]   you know, great power competitors who are using this
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.140]   against us, frankly, and have robust industrial policies. So
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.620]   I'm willing to stipulate that there will be those
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.060]   inefficiencies in this system. But I was lucky, lucky enough
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.900]   last night, I was having dinner with the Deputy Secretary of the
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.140]   Treasury while the Adi Amo who was out here meeting with
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:42.220]   founders, including battery founders in Silicon Valley, on
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.260]   this very subject. And I know some of the companies who are
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:48.540]   getting checks from the US government to scale up, right,
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:53.180]   innovative battery technologies in innovative chip
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.540]   manufacturing. And I have to say this is the best of America, I
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:01.820]   see some really great public private partnerships that are
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.100]   on shoring vital national interest in chips and batteries.
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:09.140]   And so I'm happy to see it happening. But I also know there
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.580]   will be grift and there will be waste along the way. But compare
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.780]   that David to the 8 trillion we've spent over the last 20
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:19.620]   years on war policy, and what we've gotten from that. So you
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.660]   know, you'd rather see us take chances here on innovative
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.260]   battery technologies, there's still potential waste, but not
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.180]   as wasteful as a war.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.300]   Well, of course, I mean, the first thing we got to do is
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.860]   turn off all these crazy wars, but that can't be the bar
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:36.140]   because that's a very low bar. Anything's more productive than
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:39.500]   war wasting the money blowing up other countries that we don't
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.100]   need to be involved in. I mean, remember, we do have a $32
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.220]   trillion debt, I think a great thing to do here is what they
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:48.740]   should have done with Tesla, which is when they give that
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.420]   $500 million loan to Tesla, they should have gotten 10% of that
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.460]   in warrants to buy Tesla shares at the IPO 50 million at that
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.300]   IPO would have gone what 200 x. And that would have been an
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.860]   incredible payday. So if they give this 9.2 billion to Ford,
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.420]   why not get 900 million in one share?
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.540]   Government become a VC?
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:12.100]   No, I want them to get a little participation in the upside of
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.060]   the company. I don't want them to own it. I want to be
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.660]   potential participation. Well, I'm giving a modest number here.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:18.740]   So right now,
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.260]   they're a VC without participation. But
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.220]   right now they're alone, that gets paid back with interest.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.740]   And I'm saying give them some upside in the equity, even if
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.540]   it's a small piece. Would you object to that sex?
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:31.460]   You basically want to make them a venture debt provider? Like
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.820]   SVB? Basically, yeah, like venture debt. Give them a pot
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.900]   sweetener. Yes. Yes. Give them a pot sweetener. Why not
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.620]   work out so good for SVB? You may not remember that, but
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.740]   it would have worked out incredibly well with their
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:42.260]   pressing.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.620]   My problem, you might drive a better deal for the US
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:49.100]   government in that case, which is fine with me. But it doesn't
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.900]   solve my objection, which at the end of the day, these decisions
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:54.820]   are gonna be made based on political criteria. Got it.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.300]   Okay, and we're gonna end up with crony capitalism and state
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.740]   capitalism, as opposed to entrepreneurial capitalism.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.820]   But this is in support of that, because this is a deal where
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.900]   that 9.8 billion does come over. But these are basically like
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.020]   loans and loan guarantees, and you still have to put up the
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.820]   equity yourself. That doesn't solve anybody's problem, meaning
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.300]   you need to still be entrepreneurial. And there needs
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.380]   to be risk capital. In this case, the risk capital is coming
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:19.100]   from Ford and SK. And I think that that's my understanding of
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:19.380]   this.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:24.540]   percent of the cost or 95% of the cost. So there's not much risk
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.860]   capital here from Ford, or SK. I mean, it might be opportunity
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:31.100]   costs, but it's not the full cost of these three factories,
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:35.580]   almost $13 billion. So there's still a non trivial amount of
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.100]   risk, risk capital that has to get put to work here, man, I
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:42.460]   would love to only have to put up 20% on the dollar. 30 cents on
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.500]   the dollar my investments.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.340]   I think Brad does make a good point about the security of our
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.140]   supply chain. I'm more willing to use this sort of industrial
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.500]   policy. We're talking about something that is vital to the
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.740]   security of the United States. I think you can make your you
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.860]   can make that argument with chips. I don't think electric
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.980]   vehicles rise to that quite that level.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.620]   Batteries might? I don't know.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.260]   I wouldn't say batteries do. But I think obtaining a secure
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.980]   supply of the rare earths that are needed to make batteries,
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.060]   that there's maybe a role for government.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:15.380]   The reason batteries must is because the only way to wean
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:19.900]   ourself off of the dependence we have on fossil fuels around the
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.340]   world, and even though we produce, and we're now a net
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:27.820]   exporter of oil, the reality is we're still in entanglements
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:31.460]   around the world, because the world is dependent upon those
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.260]   fossil fuels. And so I do think that that is a national security
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.020]   interest having, you know, energy independence, not only
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:39.620]   for ourselves,
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.700]   if Germany was energy independent and kept their
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.420]   nuclear running and didn't have Nord Stream, we'd have a
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.740]   different situation here. And we'd have a much different
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.260]   situation.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.420]   We got plenty of oil and gas over here.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.020]   All right, everybody. There you have it from the architect
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:56.100]   drill. Trigger warning. I like to read a Thunberg tweet.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.460]   Some off. That was a really good tweet. Shout out. Oh my god,
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:03.260]   the number of number of people I mean, did the mids like it or
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:05.380]   the mids hated it? What happened? Can I just address
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:08.580]   what this means? So when I think of somebody as a mid, it's
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.500]   somebody that is just a hapless, impotent cuck that can't think
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.420]   for themselves.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.940]   Matt Iglesias.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:22.380]   And so what I what I mean is that, you know, you become a
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:25.300]   billionaire every week. You know what this is? It's the all in
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.020]   podcast for clicks. If you 10 people have started, can I
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.740]   finish? Yes, good. It has nothing to do with your
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:36.060]   financial status. It's just everything to do with your open
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:39.780]   mindedness. And there are these people that are just so reactive
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:42.900]   on Twitter. I feel a little bit sad because I can a few years
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.780]   they'll still be very unaccomplished and yet still be
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.340]   wondering who they can blame now. And it'll just be them
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.180]   blame themselves. So I would just encourage these people to
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:57.420]   just fucking do some work. Put your head down, do the work. My
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:00.660]   God, build something, make something. So anyways, most most
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.020]   of the comments were really great and interesting. And then
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:05.100]   there's a couple of people who are like, Oh my god, how dare
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:09.700]   you? You know? And it's like, how dare I what? How dare I what
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.220]   exactly
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:14.220]   you can tell that this podcast has truly become successful when
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.780]   the mainstream media fights up and punches up to try to get us
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.980]   to respond to them to get more people to subscribe to their
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.140]   sub stack while playing Matt.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:24.180]   I'll play the funniest thing. The funniest thing was I did
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:28.060]   this tweet about Buffett. And then people are like, Oh, but I
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.420]   thought you compared yourself to Buffett. And I was like, No, no
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.220]   comparison, just benchmarks. And the thing I tweaked about the
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:38.660]   word comparison versus benchmark. And then Carson
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.620]   block jumps in and I texted Carson on the side. I was like,
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:45.620]   bro, I'm just trolling the mids. Just don't worry. This is all
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:49.100]   bullshit. It's all just for shits and giggles. I do it. I do
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.500]   it when I'm either pooing or I haven't jet lagged.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.860]   One of the it's on ambient or while taking a dump or both. No
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:03.100]   ambient, no, or the dictator, the architect, and bestie Brad,
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.680]   the fifth bestie, and our mass our new mascot, Matt, the
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.980]   mascot, who will be writing three more sub stacks about us.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.460]   I am the world's greatest moderator. Can we make that
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:21.140]   shit bread logo our logo? Yes. To co choose. austerity measure
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:25.700]   lunch. We salute you. The all in lunch will not be a standard
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.740]   way. Did you guys touch it? Do you know what it was? Was it
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:31.460]   bread? Did you touch it? I didn't touch it. No. What was
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:35.580]   it? I abandoned it immediately. Is a vegan pretzel. I don't know.
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.820]   Is that what they call dog poop now a vegan pretzel?
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:43.340]   Friedberg was gonna be there. A vegan.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.140]   Well, I mean,
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:50.300]   the WTF wants us eating insects. So this is I think that's
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.500]   probably what it looks like a vegan donut slash a doo doo.
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:32:01.140]   It's like a face when he opened that box. He just dropped it
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.540]   around. Like literally let
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:08.780]   I thought my seven year old had played a trick on me because
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:10.420]   types of like
