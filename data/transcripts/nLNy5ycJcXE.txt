[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   If I'm in a great mood, if I'm just going to be playful, a couple of really huge personal
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.440]   negotiation wins recently was when I was just trying to be playful.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.720]   I was in a great mood, and I'm joking around.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.280]   Great negotiation is not exciting, it's astonishing.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.640]   We're in conversations right now with a possible non-scripted TV show.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.400]   I was telling the producers, "This ain't going to be Real Housewives."
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.640]   To make the show properly, there ain't going to be any screaming.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   It's not going to be Bar Rescue where we're yelling at people.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.340]   We're not going to be Hell's Kitchen where we're yelling at people.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.040]   It's never going to be exciting, but it is going to be astonishing.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.860]   You'll get outcomes where suddenly you find yourself in a place like, "What in the world?
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.800]   How did that just happen?"
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.200]   I lose a suitcase in an airport the other day.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.560]   I'm walking into a lost luggage place, and I'm in a great mood because I'm home and I'm
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.560]   happy to be home.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.680]   I'm going to get a good night's sleep, and even though it's late in the day, I'm just
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   happy.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020]   I get ready to walk into the lost luggage store where these people are battered children.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.880]   They know that you expect them to wave a magic wand, and poof, your luggage is going to be
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.880]   there.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.400]   For whatever reason, that's what I say when I walk in the doors.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   Young lady says, "How can I help you?"
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.520]   Well, first of all, how you could help me is obvious because I'm in a lost luggage.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.600]   There's only one reason I'm in here, so that's kind of a silly question.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.640]   I go, "I need you to wave a magic wand."
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.540]   She just laughs, and she looks at me.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.240]   She ends up walking me out to the carousel, climbing up on the carousel, and she walks
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840]   down a ramp the luggage comes out of.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.200]   I guarantee you they're not supposed to do that.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   She sticks her head, and she looks around.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.520]   She comes back out.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   I've never seen any of these people leave the office, let alone walk back to the carousel.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.160]   She says, "Wait here."
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.960]   She disappears into the bowels of the airport, which looks like a superhighway down there.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   God knows what it looks like underneath the airport.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.240]   Pretty soon, the carousel starts up again, and my bag and another bag pops out.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.160]   This other poor schmuck is sitting there waiting.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.880]   I'm like, "I have never seen anybody do this, ever."
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.120]   Normally, they say, "Here's a number.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.320]   We'll call you in 24 hours.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.200]   It might show up at your house."
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.560]   I look around.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880]   There's another young lady there, and I say, "Please tell her thank you for me.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.200]   I got to go because she doesn't come back out for almost 10 minutes."
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.720]   On my way out, she comes out the door, and she high fives me.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.600]   She says, "How's that for waving a magic wand?"
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.160]   That was the magic phrase, and I never would have said it to her if I wasn't playful in
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.840]   a moment.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.080]   I've got a couple of others like when I was just playful, and I'm joking with people almost
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.440]   at my expense, it's shocking, astonishing what you can get people to do if you hit them
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.340]   the right way.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.340]   So interesting.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.900]   I wonder what it tapped into, but it sounds like it might have tapped into her sense that
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.280]   everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability, but finally, somebody just
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.620]   said it directly, and that would be fun to actually play that role because normally,
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.680]   they're restricted to their keyboard and their phone.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.240]   I love that.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.840]   On the opposite side of that spectrum, if ever you're feeling tense, stressed, jet-lagged,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.120]   angry, I can think about negotiations where people are trying to keep their egos in check,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.480]   they want to be right, breakups, negotiations, not necessarily romantic breakups that could
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.040]   include that, but also professional breakups, the dissolution of a contract or something
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.320]   like that, do you ever have to check yourself like, okay, I need to – I mean, I imagine
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.520]   being calm is better than not being calm for most all things.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.600]   Do you have a process of doing that?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.280]   You seem like a pretty steady guy.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   I've never seen you –
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   Overall, I'm pretty steady.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   The late night FM DJ voice that – I'm not sure that I coined the phrase, but kind of
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.560]   famous for – to calm you down also calms me down.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.960]   So if I get bent out of shape, I will – and the conversation gets heated, I'll switch
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.000]   into that voice with the intention of calming you down because that's the hostage negotiator's
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   voice.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.840]   But it'll calm me down too.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.640]   Intentionally going to that voice tamps down the negative emotions, which I'm convinced
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.280]   make me dumber in the moment, interfere with my capacity to process information.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.320]   Got reasons for that, layman's reasons, no scientific, academically rigorous studies
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.800]   that have been in any journals.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.840]   Well, after you're done, I'm going to tell you something that will perhaps be astonishing
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.300]   to you as to why there's real neuroscience behind that late night FM DJ voice having
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.080]   an impact on other people's brains.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.760]   But yeah, and I'll do that because it calms me down.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.940]   Now if I can make the shift, the hard part is to shift into a positive mindset.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.120]   If I can make that shift, but I can only make it from a calm voice.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   I also think it's – the emotions are kind of a rock, paper, scissors sequence.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.240]   I don't think you can go from sadness to elation directly, sad, depressed, down.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.580]   I think there's something to getting angry to pull you out of sadness.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.660]   And I think if you're angry, you've got to go to calm next.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.920]   And so – but if I can get out of anger and go to calm, then I can say something to myself
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.240]   like the reality is this is a luxury problem.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.780]   Or I was in a negotiation with a counterpart that I knew was deceiving, lying to me.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.600]   And I remember saying to myself, you know, I'm lucky to be in this negotiation.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.560]   I mean, they wouldn't be trying to hustle me if we weren't really good.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.280]   If we didn't have a product that was phenomenal, I wouldn't be targeted at all.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.560]   So I'm actually lucky to be in this conversation.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.920]   So if I can make that next shift emotionally, then I'm good.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   The hard part is making those shifts.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.040]   I'm going to just share with you what I learned recently about sound and emotion.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   I'm researching an episode on music in the brain, fascinating topic.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.920]   Believe it or not, there's a lot known.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.800]   And the auditory system has this property where of course there are neurons, nerve cells
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   that respond to different frequencies of sound, low frequency, you know, deeper tones and
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.280]   high frequency squeals and that sort of thing.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   Okay.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   That's pretty straightforward.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.320]   Just like we have neurons that respond to different colors or different, you know, angles
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.800]   of light in the room.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.120]   But what I learned and I confirmed with a good friend of mine who's an auditory neuroscientist
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.880]   and neurosurgeon, his name's Eddie Chang, he was a guest on this podcast previously,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:44.040]   is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is, that late night FM DJ voice
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.840]   are responded to in the brain by neurons, no surprise there.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.760]   But the frequency that those neurons fire is also low frequency.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:02.400]   In other words, when you speak in your low voice, the other person's brain hears that
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.760]   and starts firing in a low frequency tone.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.160]   In other words, it entrains to your voice, not just the timing, but it's actually like
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.380]   you're essentially playing an emotional piano down in the low keys of their mind.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.760]   Now when you go up to the high frequencies, the neurons can't follow that high frequency.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.420]   So there's something special about low frequency sound that actually changes the emotional
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.020]   tone of the people that hear that low frequency sound.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   This is wild, right?
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.160]   I mean, of course the content of the words matters too, but anyway, there's real neuroscience
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.440]   to support the voice that you were endowed with and that you employed for your work.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.000]   - Well then, and then also the point then too is it's not, the other side is not making
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   a choice.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's an involuntary reaction.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   - That's right.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.640]   This is not something one can override, except by perhaps plugging their ears.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   - Right, right, right.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.320]   - So when they're hearing that, their mind is getting shifted toward a state of low frequency
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.640]   oscillation, which is one of more calm.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.920]   So that's a real thing.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.300]   And were you to have a high squeaky chipmunk's voice, you might not have been the negotiator.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.720]   You would, although who knows, maybe there'd be another tactic there.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.440]   I mean, I think back to the, I guess it was during one of the Gulf War campaigns, weren't
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:31.120]   they trying to squeeze out Saddam and some of his people by playing like Milli Vanilli
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.040]   at high volume for hours and hours?
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   Is that tactic actually used?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.140]   - So that was Panama when they were trying to get Noriega.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.200]   - Okay, so I'm only a few, I'm only a few countries over.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.800]   - You see, you know, I get the trivia, you know, I was telling you before, and the wacky
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.000]   yet fascinating useless information around terrorism and stuff like that.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.080]   I tried that at Panama and for whatever, the military guys, they were playing music and
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   sounds.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.480]   And then also among the many stupid things that the FBI did at Waco, then late at night,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.200]   they tried that in the Waco compound too.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.640]   And it was just, that was one of the things that the hostage negotiators were adamantly
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:20.760]   against, adamantly against, but they got overruled by on scene command among the many stupid
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.360]   things that were done at Waco, that was also done at Waco.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.400]   It was stupid, it's counterproductive, hostage negotiators were always against it.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.280]   - So for those of you who don't remember Waco, Waco was Branch Davidians, David Koresh, right?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:41.600]   - Yeah, there was a Netflix series that was out about it recently that's fair about how
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   it went down.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   - It had a sad ending.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.160]   He eventually set the building ablaze, killed himself and everybody else.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.120]   - People inside set the building on fire.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.600]   - Including a lot of children perished.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   - Including some children.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.480]   There are some FBI agents that have still not gotten over that.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   (upbeat music)
