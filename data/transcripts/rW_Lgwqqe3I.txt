[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   70,000 years ago there are half a dozen different human species all around the world that are
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.640]   pretty different.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.320]   And then this group that's descended from the people in Sub-Saharan Africa just explodes
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.680]   all across the world.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.680]   So something seems like it changed.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.680]   What do you reckon it was?
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.800]   I'm very sympathetic to the idea that it's hardly genetic.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.640]   So I think that this is cultural innovation.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.380]   It's very natural to think that this is cultural innovation.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.840]   The whole continent of Sub-Saharan Africa and probably Eurasia at this time is full
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of little groups that are communicating hardly
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   at all with each other.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   In every group of human beings of hundreds of people, which is the size of a band or
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.480]   sometimes a thousand of people, they accumulate shared cultural knowledge, shared knowledge
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.360]   about tools, knowledge about life strategies.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.040]   And they build up a shared knowledge more and more and more and more.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.120]   If you have a limited sized group of people that's not interacting with a sufficiently
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.080]   large group of people, either occasionally this group has an information loss, there's
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.080]   a natural disaster, key elders in the group die and knowledge gets lost and there's not
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.580]   a critical mass of shared knowledge.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.100]   But once it goes above some kind of critical mass, the group can get larger, the amount
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.360]   of shared knowledge becomes greater, and then you have a runaway process where an increasing
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.600]   body of shared knowledge of how to make particular tools, how to innovate, patterns of innovation
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   and so on, language, conceptual ideas, run amok.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   So what you actually have in the world is 50,000 years ago is tens or hundreds or thousands
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   or tens of thousands of different human groups, each of them possessing local knowledge, rarely
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   exchanging with each other.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.360]   When we get lucky in ancient DNA and sample them, they're quite isolated from each other
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560]   and they have reduced diversity in the last tens of generations.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.640]   The great majority of them go extinct.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.120]   The great majority of them are wiped out by encounters with natural disasters or other
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.660]   groups of humans or other animals.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.040]   And so what you have is a vast experiment with an archipelago of these groups.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.180]   And what might be happening is that you just have a process of accumulation of cultural
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.800]   knowledge and loss of cultural knowledge.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.400]   But since there's many of these experiments going on, maybe something takes off somewhere
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.360]   and maybe that's what happens 50 to 100,000 years ago in people who all have the capacity
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.800]   to do these things.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.440]   So I'm attracted to that idea without being an expert on this topic.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.240]   I understand if like a new cultural technology is developed by this Near East early tribe
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.400]   that like then they expand out through Eurasia and I get like that might enable them to be
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   so dominant.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.440]   What I don't understand is how is it that none of the other ones survived, like not
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.720]   even one tribe of Denisovans or like one group of Neanderthals and one group of Hobbits.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.200]   There's no niche in which they could just like fend off.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   Everywhere this one tribe of humans, one tribe of African humans, just dominated.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.000]   I don't know if I asked the question and how did none of them survive?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.200]   I mean I think it may be a numerical issue.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.600]   I mean if you look at the part of the world where we have the best data in the Holocene,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.280]   in the last 10,000 years, there are places of long-term survival of hunter-gatherers
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.560]   for a few thousand more years than elsewhere.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   In the Netherlands, for example, hunter-gatherers survived for several thousand more years than
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.880]   in the surrounding areas, probably because they're exploiting the wetlands, but they're
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.640]   gone soon enough once something happens.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.240]   At some point, each of these places is encountered by the spread of modern humans at high densities.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   The other thing is it's not even clear to me what expansion means.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   So if you want to make strong arguments, you might argue that non-Africans today are Neanderthals,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.880]   who just have waves and waves of modern humans from Africa mixing with them.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.680]   Like who are the ancestors?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.960]   So that might sound like a silly kind of philosophical statement, but like genealogically, I don't
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.960]   know if this happened before or after my books.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   You probably don't know about this, but there was a super interesting series of papers that
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.240]   came out which made it clear, many things became clear, but one of them was that actually
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.560]   the proportion of non-Africans ancestors who are Neanderthals is not 2%, which is the proportion
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.460]   of their DNA in our genomes today if you're a non-African person.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.840]   It's more like 10 or 20% of your ancestors are Neanderthals.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.760]   And what actually happened was when Neanderthals and modern humans met and mixed, the Neanderthal
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.380]   DNA was not as biologically fit, and the reason was that Neanderthals had lived in small populations
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.700]   for about half a million years since separating from modern humans, which had lived in larger
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.720]   populations and had accumulated a large number, thousands of slightly bad mutations, such
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.360]   that in the mixed populations there was selection to remove the Neanderthal ancestry.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.960]   And that would have happened very, very rapidly after the mixture process, and there's now
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   overwhelming evidence that that must have happened.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.800]   And so if you actually look at the ancestors, if you count of your ancestors, if you're
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.680]   of non-African descent, how many of them were Neanderthals, say, 70,000 years ago, it's
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.840]   not going to be 2%, it's going to be 10 or 20%, which is a lot.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.260]   And maybe the right way to think about this is that you have a population in the Near
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.120]   East, for example, that is just encountering waves and waves of modern humans mixing.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.900]   There's so many of them that over time it stays Neanderthal, stays local, but it just
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.840]   becomes over time more and more modern human, and eventually it gets taken over from the
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.920]   inside by modern human ancestry.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's not even obvious that non-Africans today are modern humans, they're just, maybe they're
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.040]   Neanderthals who became modernized by waves and waves of admixture.
