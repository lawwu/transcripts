[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   (beeping)
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:18.060]   (music)
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.140]   This is Portfolio Rescue. Before we got on the air, Duncan and I were just talking about
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.260]   how impressed we are by the caliber of questions we're getting from people. People seem to
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.820]   have their finances in order. I'd like to think it's because they're following our advice,
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.440]   but I think actually they follow this stuff because they've already done pretty well for
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.280]   themselves. Remember, our email here is AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Today's Portfolio Rescue is brought to you
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.200]   by Bird Dog. It's the most comfortable and stylish shorts and pants in my closet. Two
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.400]   weeks ago, Duncan, it's 80 degrees here in Michigan. So I have my shorts on, very comfortable.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   I got the liner. It's great. Can wear it with a nice button-down shirt or maybe just an
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.540]   athletic tee. I'm a new convert to the pants. Over the past year or so, my daughter had
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.600]   a soccer tournament this past weekend and we were dealing with wind and rain and hail,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.780]   so I needed to be warm and comfortable. So I put on the Bird Dog sweatpants. All weekend,
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.040]   they were just delightful. All the other soccer dads were so jealous of me because I looked
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.940]   stylish and I was comfortable in the wind and rain and hail. BirdDogs.com, if you want
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.260]   to stock up on shorts, joggers, sweats, pants, use the code BenPR and you get a free 20-ounce

[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.460]   hot, warm, cold. That's BenPR and it's at BirdDogs.com.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.840]   I don't have anything as cool as that as looking good in front of other people, but the sweatpants
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.520]   are so comfy, I've actually been sleeping in them some. They're like comfy pajamas.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.140]   They're great, aren't they? Yeah.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.760]   I love it. Okay. So like I mentioned, we've been getting some great ... I mean, it's really
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.080]   cool how people are so open to sharing with us. People give us their salaries, their jobs,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.340]   their retirement account balances, when they're going to retire, all this stuff. People share
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240]   very personal information, so we don't take that for granted. We really appreciate it.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.260]   So here is one right now and I think the first one up is our first not to brag of the week.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.860]   Yeah. Yeah. Getting started strong. So first up we have, "I just read Nick's latest and
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.180]   I'm feeling a bit ashamed. Nick is awesome and just keep buying is my investment motto.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.600]   I'm 34, my wife is 28 and not to brag, we make about $590,000 a year with a net worth
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.860]   of 1.2 million. We max out our 401ks and take the employer match, about $55,000 a year.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.700]   We also save between $20,000 and $40,000 if not more. Our savings rate in my monthly budget
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.660]   is about 24%. I wonder if they use Excel like you. I also own one income producing rental
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.380]   in the Midwest. However, we live in Los Angeles and spend a lot. We take extravagant vacations.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.580]   I drive a nice car. Wish you would have told us what kind, but that's okay. I like nice
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.140]   clothing, etc. After reading Nick's piece, I felt like I should be saving more even though
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.260]   I know we save adequately, if not more than most. Save me, Ben.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.980]   Listen, you don't need me to save you financially. In your mid-30s, financially, you're doing
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.620]   amazing. You're at four, you have a seven-figure net worth, you make a mid-six-figure income,
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060]   you have a rental property that's income producing, you have a 24% savings rate. You're in an
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.980]   amazing place financially. If you never saved another dime, you have $1.2 million net worth
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.340]   and it compounded at 5% per year over the next 30 years. By retirement age, you're looking
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.060]   at $5.2 million. You are fine. You're doing just fine. You need me to save you psychologically.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.300]   This is obviously a good problem to have. This person is not alone. It can be a psychological
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.260]   hurdle for people to realize, "I've got my finances in order, but I'm following these
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.980]   personal finance experts and they make me feel bad about myself." I'm not saying that's
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.580]   his Nick. I think this is the part of Nick's post that
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.340]   has our guy Mark worried here. Nick Majulia of Dollars and Data wrote this Rich vs. Wealthy
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.620]   post. He says, "Mr. Rich," and he's trying to lay it out here, what's a good and bad
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.580]   behavior. He says, "Mr. Rich earns an impressive salary and loves to showcase his success with
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.060]   luxury cars, designer clothes, and extravagant vacations." It seems like this is written
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.860]   exactly for our person writing the question here. "He is the life of the party and appears
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.980]   to have it all. However, his high income is matched by his high spending habits, leaving
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.820]   him with little savings or investments. Should his income disappear, Mr. Rich's financial
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.540]   situation would quickly crumble, revealing the facade of his seemingly successful lifestyle."
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.100]   I can see why this kind of resonated, because it's exactly what he says. Luxury car, designer
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.180]   clothes, extravagant vacations. "Ms. Wealthy, on the other hand, earns a similar income
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.940]   to Mr. Rich, but chooses to live a more modest lifestyle. She invests a significant portion
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.860]   of her earnings into a diverse portfolio of income-producing assets that create passive
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.060]   income streams, such as rental properties and dividend stocks. She may not have the
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.260]   outward appearance of success, but she enjoys true financial freedom, knowing that her assets
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.020]   and income will continue to support her lifestyle, regardless of whether she works."
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.740]   Now, I'm not trying to put words in Nick's mouth here, but he is showing two extreme
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.940]   examples here. And the whole point of it is to show that it doesn't matter how much money
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.500]   you make, if you're not living below your means, you're not gonna get ahead and you're
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.720]   not wealthy, right? Having a large income is not the same as being wealthy. So allow
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.980]   me to offer a third option. This is the Ben Carlson middle ground, 'cause this is where
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.320]   I go. So Mr. and Mrs. Balance. Mr. and Mrs. Balance save 20 to 30% of their income and
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.660]   prioritize spending after that. They spend guilt-free on areas of their life that matter
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.180]   the most to them and cut back everywhere else. Maybe they drive a new automobile, but don't
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.740]   pay up for a luxury car. They enjoy spending money on experiences, but don't need to stay
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.260]   at five-star resorts. Maybe they live in a nice house, but spend roughly one third of
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.980]   their gross pay on housing-related expenses. They utilize debt where it makes sense, for
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.100]   things like mortgages, maybe a home equity line of credit to fix their house up, but
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.940]   they always pay off their credit card debt. Automate their savings and investing every
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.840]   month and max out their retirement accounts, but generally leave their portfolios alone.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.860]   And Mr. and Mrs. Balance don't feel guilty about spending money on the stuff that matters
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.700]   to them, 'cause they know that they are saving and investing for the future. So they prefer
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.540]   to be selectively cheap as opposed to frugal at everything, right? How's that for some
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.940]   middle ground? That's what I'm looking for here. So the way that I think about it is
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.020]   there's no hard and fast rules for how much you should save or spend, but if you're saving
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.100]   20 to 30% of your income and your income keeps growing or just stays the same, you're just
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.500]   fine. I think you just need to do a better job of figuring out how to spend guilt-free
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.960]   and the things that make you happy and defining those areas. So go on extravagant vacations
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.700]   if you want to, but maybe that means you're cutting back on eating at fine dining places,
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.320]   right? Drive a luxury automobile, but maybe that means you don't get to go to a bunch
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.740]   of concerts and shows all the time. Spend money on nice clothes, sure, but maybe that
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.060]   means you don't buy expensive furniture for your house. Whatever the trade-off is, you
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.660]   have to figure out those trade-offs. So Nick actually has another rule of thumb called
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.700]   the two times rule, where he says if you want to spend money on something really nice and
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.820]   extravagant, you have to save, too. So I think Nick's example was he buys a $250 pair of
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.700]   shoes, but when he does that, he needs $500, because he's going to save $250 as well. And
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.380]   it doesn't have to be something simple like that, but I try not to quantify these things
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.860]   as much as my finance brain likes to do that. You need to think about it more qualitatively.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.940]   So I look at it as my savings rate should be high enough that it feels a little painful
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.620]   at times, where you look at it and go, "God, imagine the amount of stuff we could buy if
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.980]   we didn't save so much." On the other hand, I think I should be spending enough money
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.900]   where that also feels a little painful at times. Can you imagine how much that money
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.700]   would be worth in 20 to 30 years if we didn't spend it on this?
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.060]   I've mentioned before on the show that I was always a big saver. I was a pretty frugal
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.020]   person growing up. For me, the big way to get over this sort of cavern of being comfortable
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.420]   spending more money was treating my savings like a bill. So every month, I treat savings
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.180]   in my 401(k), in my IRA, in my brokerage account, in the kid's 529 plans, all that stuff, it's
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.260]   automated and I treat it like a bill. It's non-negotiable. So all those savings go into
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:43.220]   those accounts automatically and then we spend whatever's left over. So I do think it's something
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.820]   that can change over time for people, too. Having kids completely changed my worldview
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.100]   of this. We only have a finite amount of time before they become teenagers and never want
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.900]   to spend any time with us anymore. So my wife and I prioritize spending money on experiences
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.300]   now, as opposed to maybe having that money when we're 60 or 70 to do stuff. So I look
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.580]   at it as I'm selectively cheap in certain areas and selectively extravagant in other
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.100]   areas. I think that's the thing. I don't judge other people's spending habits as long as
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.660]   they're saving money. So this person is saving money. They have a double-digit savings rate.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.220]   Spend the money on whatever makes you happy, then, and figure out ways to cut back elsewhere.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.300]   That's the kind of thing. I think you just have to align any future lifestyle creep with
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.120]   future increases in savings. So I think the biggest problem for people making as much
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.500]   as you do and having a high net worth is trying to keep up with people who have even more
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.560]   money than you. That's where the problems come in. But otherwise, you're doing fine.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.460]   If you're saving that much and you can still spend, you're in a good place.
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.340]   Yeah. There's always going to be someone, right? There's always going to be someone
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.980]   that's doing better, spending more, that kind of thing. So yeah, I feel like that's a dangerous
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.980]   game.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.020]   I think that's the problem. Some people look at it as, "I need to keep up with this person
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.260]   because they spend so much and they have all these toys and they have a boat and they
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.540]   have a jet ski and they have all this stuff. I need to keep up with them so they spend
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.460]   too much." Other people go down the personal finance track of, "Well, geez, that fireperson
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.540]   is saving 70% of their income and they're eating grass in their backyard to save money
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.140]   by not going out to eat." Whatever it is, and I should be doing that too. Why am I not
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.660]   doing that? I prefer the middle ground of, "Listen, I've heard enough stories of people
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.380]   who save their entire life and then they get to retirement age and something health-wise
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.420]   breaks in and they all of a sudden die or someone gets dementia or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.460]   or whatever, and it totally derails their plans."
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:33.140]   And so I'm a huge proponent of enjoying yourself now as long as you have a decent savings rate
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.460]   that you can delay some gratification for the future. I think a balanced approach makes
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.380]   a lot more sense and that makes it so you don't have to feel so guilty about spending
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.620]   money when you have the savings taken care of and it's already done.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.940]   So what you're saying is YOLO.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.940]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.420]   You only live once.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.620]   I mean, yeah, YOLO white. We're like YOLO white.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.500]   Yeah, diet YOLO. How's that?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.620]   But yeah, this person is doing so well for themselves and if they keep a 20-some percent
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.000]   savings rate at that, I guess the big problem would be if their income doesn't stay forever.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.860]   We talked before we got on about who are these young people making this much money? And it's
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.700]   tech people and private equity people from our experience. And so those industries can
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.620]   be fairly fickle. So if that income all of a sudden goes away, then you have to make
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.500]   some hard choices. Right now, the fact that you're saving so much money, you're saving
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.100]   a quarter of your income, you're fine.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:31.100]   Yeah, not bad. Okay. And you know how I look nice and wear nice clothes without breaking
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.540]   the bank? Bird dogs.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.580]   There you go.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.580]   Smooth.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.660]   Okay. So up next, we have a question from V. I think is how you say it. I was hoping
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.500]   you could explain the relationship between the 10-year treasury yield and the P/E ratio
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.940]   on equities. Does a 4% yield on the 10-year indicate a 25 P/E on risk-free assets? So
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.220]   if the 10-year is at 4%, do we just add the equity risk premium to that to get the expected
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.820]   return? You can tell by the way I'm reading that, I have no idea what I'm reading there.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.300]   All right. Equity risk premium. It's kind of an academic term. It's basically just any
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:13.220]   excess return you get in stocks over some sort of risk-free rate. So since 1928, the
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.340]   stock market in the U.S. is up like 9.6% per year. Bonds, in using the 10-year treasury
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.700]   as a risk-free rate, stand in here, are up 4.6%. So we're talking about a 5% equity risk
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.380]   premium, right? Over and above some sort of benchmark. You could use cash, too. Cash is
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.540]   up like 3-something percent over that. So it would be even higher if you used cash.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.940]   So the idea here would be, can we just take the bond yield and slap on this historical
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.900]   premium and get expected returns? I wish it was that easy. John, do a chart on for us.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.980]   This is the returns by decade for stocks, bonds, and cash since the 1930s. Stocks is
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.100]   the S&P 500. Bonds is the 10-year treasury. Cash is three-month T-bills. And I also put
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.220]   another category in here, starting rates. And that's the starting 10-year treasury.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.580]   And sometimes high starting yields led to above-average returns. Sometimes they didn't.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.300]   Sometimes -- same thing as low starting yields. Sometimes it led to good returns. Sometimes
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.820]   it led to bad returns. Unfortunately, there's not much rhyme or reason here when it comes
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.220]   to rates. And that's because that relationship with stocks and bonds is not quite that simple.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.820]   Athalas Damodaran from NYU, a recent guest on Masters in Business with Barry. Highly
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.860]   recommend if you want to listen to that.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.860]   He's awesome.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.780]   Yeah, he's great. Updates the equity risk premium on a monthly basis on his blog. So
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.920]   I get a ton of free long-term data from his blog, actually. John, do a chart on here.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.100]   This is Damodaran's equity risk premium versus bond yields going back to 1960. The blue line
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.580]   there is bond yields. Orange is the equity risk premium. You can see, there's a little
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.220]   uptick in the equity risk premium when bonds were rising in the '60s and '70s, but it certainly
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.420]   didn't keep up. And then, it's kind of interesting that as the bond yields have fallen this century,
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.380]   the equity risk premium has actually risen. So, it's not like a one-to-one relationship.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.220]   The variables are kind of all over the place. And it certainly doesn't always keep pace.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.500]   It would be nice if it did, but at a certain point, if bond yields were high enough, they
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.060]   become competition for stocks, and you're not going to get as much of a premium there.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.220]   So, it's more one of these things that works out of a long-term average. It's not like
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.940]   it's going to follow on a year-to-year basis or anything. So, I'm not sure there's much
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.740]   useful information in this kind of valuation measure beyond the fact that the equity risk
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.460]   premium will likely go up when stocks are going down, and down when stocks are going
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.660]   up. That's kind of the only ... I actually like John Bogle's expected returns formula
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.820]   better. He outlines this in one of his books. I think it was "Don't Count On It," which
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.040]   is excellent. Very underrated author, actually, for all the great things he did. He breaks
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.860]   down returns into three components. John, do another chart on here. Bogle looks at this
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.740]   in terms of dividends, earnings growth, and then changes in valuations. And that gives
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.060]   you your returns. This is another one by decades, going back to the 1900s. Bogle started this,
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:55.140]   and I kind of filled it in the last couple decades. And the easy part is the fundamentals.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.140]   Earnings are all over the place by decade, but they're not a huge wide range. Dividends,
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.980]   that's a pretty easy one. The starting yield, you can calculate that pretty easily. So,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.160]   you could back up the envelope a pretty good ... Dividends are 1.5%. Earnings growth, I
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.920]   think, is going to be 6. Stock market is going to give you 7.5%. But that change in valuations
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.220]   is the big part of it, and that's kind of a filler. It's kind of how people feel about
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.900]   the stock market, and how they feel about where they allocate their assets. And that's
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.740]   the kind of thing that's impossible to predict. So, the furthest I'm willing to go out on
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.680]   a limb here is that stocks will outperform bonds over the very long term. But over the
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.900]   short term, there's going to be times when bonds and cash outperform, which is not super
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.460]   helpful. But that's the problem with these things. It's not very easy to come up with,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.780]   especially in the stock market. The bond market's easy. If you take the starting yield, and
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.620]   if you go anywhere out beyond government bonds, take away any sort of default or credit risk,
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.660]   take that out of the equation, you get a pretty good starting point from the starting yield.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.460]   The stock market is much harder to figure out. Sometimes even valuations don't help
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:01.420]   you much over 5, 10, even 15 years. So, I think the relationship between equity risk
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.360]   premiums and interest rates is probably a lot more noise and signal embedded in it.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.700]   But, fair question.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.100]   Look at that 1.2% dividend in the 2000s. That really stands out there.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:18.900]   Yes. I mean, the 1999-2000 is probably the worst entry point in the history of the U.S.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:26.100]   stock market. That's a pretty good one. Valuations were so skewed to the upside that, yeah, it
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.520]   had to be pretty -- the first decade of that century was awful.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.100]   All right. Let's do another one. Do you know what the equity risk premium is now? You got
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   it?
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.460]   Yeah. Sure. I think so.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   Close enough.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.740]   I've read Ben Graham. Yeah. I think I got it.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:51.140]   All right. Up next, we have a question from James. Let's see. If one is able to, is there
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.980]   any reason not to just lump some $30,000 to $50,000 into a 529 and call it a day? What's
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.340]   a reasonable target for the future value of a 529? Seems like colleges can demand whatever
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.680]   price they want, which makes it impossible to predict. I have some thoughts on this one,
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.260]   having been involved in academia in the past.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.140]   All right. Let's look at the Consumer Price Index for college tuition and fees, set against
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:19.980]   the regular old CPI, John. On an annualized basis since the late 1970s, the annual inflation
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.420]   for college is like 6.3%, 3.5% or so for the regular CPI. Almost double over a very long
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.980]   time period. You can see, in this century, it's even risen more.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.300]   To be fair, things have leveled out a little bit. Let's do the next one, John. This is
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:42.140]   over the last 10 years. The CPI is actually above college, and that's more that inflation
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.060]   is playing catch-up, not necessarily that college tuition is slowing. It's still increased
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.260]   at a pretty good rate. So this is the kind of financial planning question that, unfortunately,
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.900]   doesn't have a great answer. So why don't we bring a financial advisor in to help with
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.220]   this one, since this is another one that's hard to quantify, exactly.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.220]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.260]   Kevin Young, back to the show. Hey, Kevin.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.140]   Gentlemen, nice to be here. Thanks for giving me the hardballs here.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.340]   Well, I think this is kind of like planning for a moving target. And I've heard this from
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.700]   people before, like, listen, I have no idea how much college is going to be, you know,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   if my kid's going to be in college in 15 years or whatever, how in the world am I supposed
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.860]   to plan for this when college inflation is running at 6% per year? Is it going to be,
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.460]   you know, $100,000 a semester or whatever it is? How do you even begin to plan for something
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.180]   like that, that is a target that you can't, it's not like you can lock it in right now.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.780]   So how do you think about this?
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:38.180]   Yeah, so it is a very, very common question that financial advisors get, is how much is
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:44.260]   the right amount to save? And the honest answer is, I don't know. No one really does because,
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:50.980]   you know, you've got a three-month-old baby at home, understanding what they're going
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.420]   to be interested, where they're going to want to go to school, if they're going to want
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.140]   to go to school, what college looks like in, you know, 17 and a half years from that moment
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.940]   is impossible to predict.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:07.420]   That being said, I think starting out early with a lump sum is a great idea if you can
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:13.940]   do it. Let the compounding work for you, right? Nick Majulia, our colleague who you mentioned
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:20.060]   previously, has written a lot about lump sum versus dollar cost averaging. And with a long
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.100]   enough time horizon, lump sum statistically works out far more frequently than dollar
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.940]   cost averaging. The other thing to consider here, though, would be depending on what state
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.780]   you're in is going to have a big impact on the tax deductibility of this kind of contribution.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.440]   You might have to spread it out if you want the tax deductibility, right?
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:48.580]   Yeah, exactly. And so the example here, $50,000. I live in the state of Connecticut. In Connecticut,
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:54.700]   I can make a $50,000 contribution to one of my kids' 529s, and I could deduct $10,000
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:01.880]   per year over five years. Easy, great, awesome, everybody wins. There are other states that
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.020]   have that same $10,000 deduction per year, but they will not let you carry forward the
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:15.140]   deduction. So in order to really capture it, you'd have to do 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. So now
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.480]   with that out there, the other thing to consider is, OK, well, even if I'm in the highest tax
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:27.260]   bracket in my state, $10,000 off my state income, is it really going to move the needle?
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.080]   My argument would be probably having the dollars compounding for that much longer probably
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   outweighs it.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.540]   Yeah, you're comparing it to investments at that point, right?
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:41.860]   Exactly, exactly. And so just thinking about, OK, well, what if I put in $50,000? And let's
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:49.060]   say you return, I think I ran it at 6%. Obviously, early on, we're going to be pretty aggressive.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.780]   As we get closer to school, we're going to dial down the risk. You're probably looking
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:00.820]   over 17-ish years, you're looking somewhere around $130,000 of future value. Right now,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:06.380]   that would be enough to pay for a good, large in-state public institution. It's going to
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:13.740]   buy you a year and a half at some of the more expensive private schools, your Harvard's,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.020]   your Duke's, your Lehigh's, et cetera.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.540]   So those things are unanswerable at this point. It's not a bad idea to start saving early
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.260]   with a lump sum. And the thing that makes me even a little bit more bullish on this
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.660]   idea now than I was even a couple months ago is the new legislation that will allow people
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.260]   to convert unused $529 into a Roth IRA.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.080]   So we've got a lot of questions for Bill Sweet about that one. People love that option.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.460]   Yeah, yeah. So for my daughter, Emma, who's she'll be five in a month or two, if she goes
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:52.020]   to school and there's $10,000 left over in her 529 at the end of the time, she can convert
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.940]   that at whatever the contribution limit is that year. As long as it's been in for 15
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.900]   years and hasn't been added two and five, there's some nuance there. She can convert
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.300]   whatever the contribution limit that is for that year, convert it to a Roth in her name,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   and 30 years later, she's going to be pretty happy that she did that.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.820]   So I think that takes a little bit of the edge off of the idea of, "I don't want to
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.920]   over-save." Because at the end of the day, you're just putting money aside for your kids.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.940]   And now you've got the extra flexibility of, if we don't use it all, they're already on
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.460]   a great path for retirement.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:30.660]   Right. And the thing about now, it's a moving goalpost kind of thing. But I think that as
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.780]   you get closer to the date, then you can kind of figure out what the actual costs are and
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.760]   where you stand. And maybe that's a time to actually have a good financial conversation
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.580]   with your 18-year-old child about finances and understanding, "Listen, set some boundaries.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.620]   We'll pay for your whole state school. But if you go to a private school, we're only
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.860]   going to pay for 30% of it and you have to take the rest." Whatever it is, I think that's
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.300]   a good way to open up to thinking through the various options, depending on how much
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   you have at that time.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:22:00.940]   Yeah. And I think there's some kind of stigma around parents just being proud. And if their
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.660]   parents were able to pay for college, or they maybe weren't able to pay for college, it's
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.460]   almost like a thing where people feel like they have to pay for whatever school their
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.180]   kid wants to go to or whatever they get into. But to your point, I think it's a great thing
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.780]   to have that conversation with your child.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.500]   Alternatively, I have a friend who has five kids, which is pretty rare these days. And
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:27.020]   he said from the start, "I'm not saving for any of my kids. They're on their own."
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.620]   I guess if that's the decision you want to make, but you're right. But I think a lot
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.140]   of parents do. I understand how a lot of parents out there don't have a ton of savings because
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.660]   they put their child first. That makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.500]   Yeah. And you want to ... Our colleague, Tony Isola, does this for our clients a lot, right?
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:47.460]   He'll run comparisons of, "Okay, your kid got into this place at $75,000 a year and
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.660]   the state school at $25,000 a year, and they absolutely love history and they're going
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:57.780]   to be a history major." And he can show you the data that says, "Here's what a graduate
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.460]   of their history program makes two years out of school from each place." Most of these
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.500]   things are not that wide of a spread. So just having that conversation with the student
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.980]   and saying, "This is the difference. You're not going to make much more by spending $50,000
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:17.140]   more a year for four years." It's worth having the conversation.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.140]   Right.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.740]   And I'm not picking on history majors because I am one and I love history, so.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:29.380]   Yeah. I was just going to throw into this conversation. I did a poll on the chat whether
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.900]   or not college tuition should be capped or regulated. And the vast majority of people,
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.820]   for what it's worth, we have 130 some people watching right now. But the vast majority
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   of people are saying yes. So I feel like something might happen down the road. Too many people
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.660]   are getting really upset about this.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.060]   I would say that that 6%, there's no way that can continue forever. Because at a certain
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.700]   point, the growth in that is just so high, it becomes impossible for people to go and
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.420]   more people are going to college. So you'd think at a certain point, technology would
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.780]   step in and make things a little easier that would level off.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.940]   And it's not helping the learning. It's not helping the education, right? I dropped a
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.500]   stat in here that Stanford now has almost 16,000 administrators and they have just under
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:14.660]   17,000 students. That's not professors, administrators. So that probably sounds like a problem. And
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.140]   in my experience, I thought that there was definitely an administrator bloat at the schools
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.140]   I taught at.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.820]   All right. Let's do another one.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:30.140]   Okay. Up next we have a life insurance question. If I died tomorrow, what would be a reasonable
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.020]   amount of money to leave to my child in the form of life insurance? I would imagine enough
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.300]   to pay off our mortgage and cover expenses until the child can finish college. I've read
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.900]   that the average amount it takes to raise a child to 18 is $300,000. Is $300,000 plus
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.580]   remainder of the mortgage balance a reasonable life insurance target? Some have suggested
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:54.740]   more to continue funding current lifestyle, my income of $450,000. However, my wife is
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.820]   also a high earner, so I'm not concerned about reproducing my earnings.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.660]   >> Okay. This is actually the question from the same guy, James here. He asked both these
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.700]   questions. I like him so much. I got life insurance following the birth of my first
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.460]   child. Honestly, I decided the amount based on a number that sounded good at the time.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.020]   I did not crunch any numbers. It's just kind of -- they were kind of like, "Do you want
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.180]   a half a million dollars or a million?" And it was like, I don't know, $10 a month more.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.140]   I'm like, "Let's do a million." So again, this is kind of another one that you don't
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.220]   really know because -- and it's kind of morbid to think about this stuff, but obviously,
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.780]   again, with a family, this is the kind of thing that you have to have. It's kind of
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.740]   a difficult decision. So how do you -- when you're working with clients to ensure any
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.460]   kind of risk like this, where do you begin?
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:40.460]   >> So I think he -- James mentioned the word reasonable. And I think reasonable is one
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.780]   way to approach this. Yes, having enough money to cover the cost of raising a child and your
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.900]   mortgage is a very reasonable approach to life insurance. Does that mean it's the answer?
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   No, it doesn't. Because there are -- there are other aspects to consider. You know, one
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.820]   thing is you mentioned, you know, your high salary. Okay, if that goes away, but your
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.780]   wife is still a high earner, would your wife want to work if you hadn't woken up this morning,
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:17.340]   whether that be for three months, six months, forever? I think there's -- one is I'd have
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:23.420]   that conversation and be real clear on what that means. And by the way, that's a two-way
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:29.180]   conversation. Just because you make more as a spouse does not mean that you shouldn't
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.900]   have insurance on a nonworking spouse or a spouse that makes less than you. My wife works
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:40.940]   part-time, but a big part of her job is helping to raise our children. If God forbid she wasn't
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.740]   here anymore, I would need help, a lot of it. And so that's something to consider as
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:52.900]   well. But so I also just think about sort of the outside of the spreadsheet ramifications,
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.300]   right? What's the emotional toll on something like that happening? And I think that's what
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:03.340]   leads back to, yeah, the math makes sense, but in your kind of stomach and heart, does
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:09.100]   it really make sense? For an extra half a million dollars, if you just had a child,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:16.420]   you're thinking about 529s and life insurance, I'm assuming you're maybe in your 30s, like
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.700]   you said, Ben, an extra half a million dollars of term life insurance at 15 or 20 bucks a
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.100]   month for somebody making 450, I think that's an appropriate --
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.900]   If you're in good health and you're relatively young, you are in the stage of having kids,
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:39.620]   it's not that expensive. That's the thing. Yeah. And so, you know, to hedge that with
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:46.300]   a tiny fraction of your income, I think is worth it. Look, the likelihood is that it's
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.820]   not going to pay out. That's why term insurance works. Most of it will never, ever be paid
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:56.600]   out. But you don't want to be, you know, you don't want to put your family in a situation
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.860]   where they're thinking, wait, if he had, I thought he had this much and he only has this
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.860]   much and you're telling me if he had paid 20 more dollars a month, then I wouldn't have
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.100]   to go back to work and I could be with my family full time or I can do X, Y, and Z.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.260]   I just think it's a good idea just to up it. And, you know, you can always reduce it later
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.380]   on. You can always change things. So but it's never a bad idea to lock it in when it's cheap
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   and you're young.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.340]   Duncan, you can probably get a smaller amount. Your wife can just sell your hat collection.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.060]   Yeah, that's, I mean, that's kind of the plan. Beanie babies and hats.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.060]   All right. We got one more question.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:36.900]   OK, up next, we have. My wife and I are retiring next year at 57 with four million dollars
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:43.180]   in a 55-45 portfolio, a one point three million dollar house and zero debt. Not to brag. We
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.660]   know we're blessed. If we'll get forty two hundred dollars a month at sixty two and seventy
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.020]   three hundred dollars a month at seventy and a half in Social Security and only need a
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.060]   three percent withdrawal at retirement because we're not spenders. Doesn't it make more sense
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:01.160]   to take Social Security at sixty two and use our cash bucket and then an IRA at fifty nine
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.620]   and a half for the remaining amount by taking Social Security early? That forty two hundred
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.540]   dollars a month would stay invested and we'd be doing Roth conversions for years. I know
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.260]   we'd break even at some point in our 80s or 90s, depending on the market. But by that
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.020]   time, we're spending a lot less, even if Rick Edelman is right and we live to one hundred
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:22.500]   and ten. Just trying to apply some math and common sense before we have to make some decisions.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.460]   Good TCAF. Yeah. Thanks for watching. Watching everything. So I think the return you get
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.100]   by waiting from sixty two to seventy is like been calculated like seven or eight percent
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.020]   per year. Right. That sounds about right to you. That's like the bump you get. And that
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.460]   makes sense based on these numbers that are given here. So they're saying if we just waited
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.100]   or if we took it early, we wouldn't have to pull that forty two hundred from our portfolio.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.380]   And then, you know, they've kind of it sounds like they've done the break evens here. But
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:54.180]   in my thinking, isn't this just a wash? And then there's other ancillary things you have
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:59.180]   to think about, like the portfolio withdrawals or minimum distributions or taxes, all that
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.180]   other stuff. Isn't that kind of what you're getting down to? You're whittling things down
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:11.060]   here. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, what I would think about here is, you know,
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:15.900]   I ran some just some basic some basic numbers here. And I think if you and I'm sure this
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.780]   isn't the case, but if the Social Security payments were exactly equal for for each spouse
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:28.820]   here, the break even on this, if you delay, i.e. what what amount of money at what age
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.700]   would the delaying the payout make sense as far as you've now collected the same amount
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.400]   of dollars? It's it's just to age 80. So from 70 to 80, you know, you're you're you're catching
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.120]   up and you're catching up quickly on those previous eight years. And if you live to 90,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.000]   the number ends up being something in the neighborhood of an extra six hundred thousand
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.960]   dollars in benefits. So obviously, the longer you live, the better that trade is. That's
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.620]   a variable we obviously can't control. Rick Edelman last week, as you mentioned, I was
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:05.420]   pretty shook after that episode for a lot of reasons. But I think if if you're if you've
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:12.320]   got, you know, a decent idea that you're probably going to live into the 90s, then I think delaying
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.620]   probably does make sense on paper. The other thing that, you know, we obviously can't really
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.060]   opine on because we don't know the makeup of the investment accounts here. But if you're
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.940]   talking about RMDs and doing Roth conversions, those kinds of things are going to drag your
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.820]   income forward, your ordinary taxable income forward. So if you are doing if you're getting
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:38.100]   your Social Security at 62, you're doing Roth conversions at 62 through 70. If you're taking
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.580]   one hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year in whether it be long term cap gains
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:48.380]   or money from your money from your IRAs, all of a sudden your taxable income is going to
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:54.300]   be relatively high. And the higher your regular income is, the more taxed you get on Social
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:01.080]   Security. So, you know, there's this is one of those things where, like we tell people
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.860]   all the time, you can't Google expertise. We we you guys know, we talk to a lot of people
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:12.220]   that have successfully done this themselves for twenty five, thirty years and they get
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.900]   to this point and all of a sudden there's a lot of questions that you can't quite answer
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.500]   just by plugging in some numbers on an Excel sheet. Right. And then one question leads
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.820]   to another question and another one. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, you know, I'm not sitting
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.700]   here as a as a shill saying, give us a call. We'll help you out and we'd love to work with
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.240]   you. But at the end of the day, like it might be worth just seeing having somebody run through
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.380]   these scenarios with you, because I think the great thing for this couple is I think
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.500]   at the end of the day, it's not really going to matter yet on the on the spreadsheet. It'll
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.760]   matter. But are they going to run out of money if they take Social Security early at these
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.000]   spending rates? No, they're not. So it's really a question of what are you trying to really
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.860]   accomplish with the money? Why are you doing Roth conversions? Are you trying to leave
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.780]   a legacy for kids and grandkids? Are you just trying to, you know, enjoy it while you're
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:06.300]   here and die with zero? Right. So there's a lot of different variables here. But I think
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.820]   I think delaying it could be helpful because you just know that on the back end, you're
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.860]   going to have a guaranteed income. That's also shows what a great deal Social Security
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.060]   is for some people. Seventy three hundred dollars a month is I mean, we're talking close
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.980]   to ninety thousand dollars a year in income. Mm hmm. I mean, it's just an amazing program.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.440]   And it sounds like these people have things all set anyway and don't really don't really
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.380]   need it. Yep. Yep. And that's the ability. And again, like just going back to the tax
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.860]   piece of it, like that is the devil's in the details with this stuff. And if you're not
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:45.180]   really thinking about taxes, you're not thinking about, oh, well, if I do these Roth conversions
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.820]   and my ordinary income rate gets bumped up and now I'm paying a higher Medicare subsidy.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.780]   Oh, I hadn't thought about that. Right. So there's there's so many moving parts to this.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.780]   A lot of decision trees. Again, like these people are in great shape. So that's a good
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:06.280]   thing. But, you know, it might be it might be worth talking to an advisor and a tax and
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.020]   a tax pro as well, just to get a good sense of things. All right. Duncan's request for
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:16.220]   next week is question two for some regular Joe's without. I mean, I was just saying to
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:20.060]   Cliff in the chat, you know, these are these are questions we get, you know, so it's somewhat
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.700]   it's self-selecting. It's true. The people. Yeah, it is self-selecting. Next week, unless
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.820]   something goes wrong, we'll be back here with a rebrand of the show. Right. Duncan, putting
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.780]   me on the spot. Yeah, I put you on the spot. If I put it out some more work to do. Am I
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.340]   the last guest of Portfolio Rescue? It's possible. Wow. It's got to come through for us over
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.880]   email. Ask the compound show at Gmail dot com. Leave us a question or comment on YouTube.
