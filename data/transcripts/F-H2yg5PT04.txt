[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   - I think it's a good chance in the 2030s
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   that we will be on Mars.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.920]   In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   It's an engineering problem.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.920]   It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040]   but it is an engineering problem.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.040]   And in my book, "Future of Humanity,"
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   I even speculate beyond that,
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.640]   that by the end of the century,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160]   we'll probably have the first starships.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.600]   The first starships will not look like the Enterprise
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.520]   at all.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.080]   There'll probably be small computer chips
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.240]   that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.840]   And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.920]   the Breakthrough Starshot program could send ships,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.320]   ships to the nearby stars,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.840]   traveling at 20% the speed of light,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years' time.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.380]   Beyond that, we should have fusion power.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.120]   Fusion power is, in some sense,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.360]   one of the ultimate sources of energy,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.160]   but it's unstable.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.040]   And we don't have fusion power today.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.160]   Now, why is that?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.640]   First of all, stars form almost for free.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000]   You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.360]   I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.920]   and it becomes a star.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.840]   Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.520]   Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.160]   They are poles, single poles that are spherically symmetric.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.800]   And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600]   configurations of gas to compress into a star.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200]   It just happens naturally all by itself.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.220]   The problem is magnetism is bipolar.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.640]   You have a North Pole and a South Pole.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.400]   Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.640]   You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.000]   Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.920]   to squeeze gas.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.600]   And all sorts of anomalies and horrible configurations
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.880]   can take place because we're not squeezing something uniformly
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.360]   like in a star.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600]   Stars, in some sense, are for free.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560]   Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.400]   But I think it's inevitable.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.640]   So seawater will be the ultimate source
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.600]   of energy for the planet Earth.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.120]   Why?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.200]   What's the intuition there?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.840]   Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.200]   burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.640]   to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400]   without the nuclear waste.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.120]   Why do we have meltdowns?
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.280]   We have meltdowns because in the fission reactors,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.160]   every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.120]   Tons of it.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.560]   30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.880]   And it's hot.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640]   It's hot for thousands, millions of years.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   That's why we have meltdowns.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.040]   But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920]   is helium gas.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280]   Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.800]   You can make money selling helium gas.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.320]   And so the waste product of a fusion reactor
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.000]   is helium, not nuclear waste that we find
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.200]   in a commercial fission plant.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.760]   And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.840]   allows us to convert this into a type one,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.600]   I guess, civilization, right?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.720]   Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.160]   will be fusion power.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   We, by the way, are type zero.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.000]   We don't even rate on this scale.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.480]   We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.000]   oil and coal.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.720]   But we are about 100 years from being type one.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.160]   Get a calculator.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.360]   In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.040]   are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.120]   For example, what is the internet?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.680]   The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.480]   to enter into our century.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.800]   The first planetary technology is the internet.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.240]   What is the language of type one?
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.280]   are the most dominant languages on the internet.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.760]   And what about the culture?
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.120]   We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.280]   type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.240]   type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.960]   the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.600]   So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.640]   culture and a type one civilization.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.400]   And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.120]   So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200]   on a chip into Alpha Centauri.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   But in a slightly nearer term, what
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.680]   do you think about the idea when we still have to send
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.480]   biological, our biological bodies,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.960]   the colonization of planets, colonization of Mars?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.800]   Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.520]   or anytime soon?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.720]   Well, just remember the dinosaurs
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.160]   did not have a space program.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.840]   And that's why they're not here today.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.000]   How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.320]   Because they didn't have a space program.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.400]   We do have a space program, which means that we
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.160]   have an insurance policy.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.480]   Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.240]   or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.760]   That's too expensive and not practical.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.960]   But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.120]   in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.840]   And that means we have to terraform Mars.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.760]   Now, to terraform Mars, if we could raise the temperature
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.560]   of Mars by 6 degrees, 6 degrees, then the polar ice caps
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.920]   begin to melt, releasing water vapor.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.080]   Water vapor is the greenhouse gas.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.840]   It causes even more melting of the ice caps.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.600]   So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.360]   It feeds on itself.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.760]   It becomes autocatalytic.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.040]   And so once you hit 6 degrees, rising of the temperature
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.680]   on Mars by 6 degrees, it takes off.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.760]   And we melt the polar ice caps.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.000]   And liquid water once again flows
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.280]   in the rivers, the canals, the channels,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.880]   and the oceans of Mars.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.320]   Mars once had an ocean, we think,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.600]   about the size of the United States.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   And so that is a possibility.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.520]   Now, how do we get there?
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.440]   How do we raise the temperature of Mars by 6 degrees?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.080]   Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.320]   on the polar ice caps.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.080]   Yes.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.800]   Well, I'm not sure about that, because we
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.200]   don't know that much about the effects of detonating
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.920]   hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   And who wants to glow in the dark at night
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.640]   reading the newspaper?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.400]   So I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.280]   You can have satellites orbiting Mars
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.080]   that beam sunlight onto the polar ice caps,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.880]   melting the polar ice caps.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.840]   Mars has plenty of water.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   It's just frozen.
