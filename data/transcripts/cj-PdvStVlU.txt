[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   I had this one idea, what if I sold everything I owned,
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.040]   and I volunteered for one year.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.800]   At 18, I stumble into this occupation
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.720]   in New York City nightlife,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320]   running around smoking 40 cigarettes a day,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.680]   doing drugs, going to strip clubs.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.920]   And it was really at the end of that 10 years
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.560]   where I realized, wow, I'm a mess.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.120]   I joined this mission of humanitarian doctors and surgeons
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.680]   to volunteer their time and offer free medical services
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.720]   to people who couldn't afford it,
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.000]   which then led to my discovery of the need for clean water.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.320]   I look at wealth as an opportunity
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.880]   to do more good in the world in ending suffering.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.720]   How can I take my time, my talent, my money,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.640]   and use it to help others?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.160]   70% of Americans believe charities waste their money.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.800]   So many of the things that we've tried to do
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.520]   at Charity Water is restore that lost faith,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.760]   get people addicted to generosity.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760]   I was in Northern Ethiopia once,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.080]   and somebody came up to me, said,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.160]   "Hey, we've heard of you.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   "We know the impact you're making up here.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   "Let me tell you a story."
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.440]   The women in my village,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.160]   they used to all walk eight hours a day.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.680]   And he goes, "There was this one woman,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.440]   "at the end of one of her walks,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.200]   "she slipped and she fell,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000]   "and all the water that she had just walked for
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.400]   "spilled out onto the ground.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.160]   "And she had this clay pot on her back,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.600]   "and the clay pot shattered."
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   And he said, "She didn't go get another pot.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.920]   "She didn't go back and go refill the water."
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520]   He said, "She took a rope, and she climbed a tree,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.200]   "and she."
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.600]   - Scott, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   - It's good to be here, Chris.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.680]   I've been looking forward to this.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.520]   It'll be fun.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.400]   - I think for so many people,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   they've seen you, they know Charity Water,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.960]   but they don't know the story.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.040]   And I think there's a lot of things I wanna dive into
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.960]   that mean going back to the beginning
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.320]   and understanding where you came from,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   because it's not the same story
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.720]   that most people go through.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040]   - Well, I think act one is a pretty bizarre childhood.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   When I was four, I was born in Philadelphia,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.480]   middle-class family.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.680]   Dad was a business guy.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.880]   My mom was a writer.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.640]   And we moved into this really ugly gray house
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.760]   at the end of a cul-de-sac in the dead of winter.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.640]   My parents were gonna have a big family there,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400]   and it was close to my dad's job,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.600]   so we had a small commute.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.080]   These were all the concerns at the time.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.000]   And the house was advertised as energy efficient,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.840]   which was great,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   except the house came with a carbon monoxide gas leak.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.080]   So we move in and we all start getting headaches.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.720]   And on New Year's Day, 1980,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.280]   my mom walks across the bedroom and she collapses.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560]   She crumples to the floor.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.960]   So she's the canary in the coal mine,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.640]   which leads to a series of blood tests,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.200]   which leads to the discovery of carbon monoxide
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.400]   in her bloodstream,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.440]   which then leads to the leak,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   which was in the basement
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.160]   and it was this faulty heat exchanger.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.080]   And I remember my dad ripped it out with an HVAC guy
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.840]   and he threw it on the sidewalk.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.200]   But unfortunately,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   the damage was just done specifically for my mom.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.320]   And she just never recovered.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   She never bounced back from that.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.120]   My dad and I bounced back from our symptoms.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   But what happened to her was her immune system
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.080]   was irreparably destroyed.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.640]   And her body was no longer able to process chemicals,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.120]   process anything toxic.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.320]   So I think the best way to describe it from this point on,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.880]   she just lived in a bubble.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.720]   She lived in one room, isolated.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160]   She wore a 3M mask, like an N95,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   really for the rest of her life.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.960]   And family planning stopped.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.320]   So I grew up this only child,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.120]   very quickly now in a caregiver role,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.240]   helping to cook for mom,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.120]   helping to clean,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240]   really just helping try to make her
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.600]   as comfortable as possible.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.120]   And maybe just to give everybody one story
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   that I remember as a kid.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.800]   I remember mom, she was a writer,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   so she loved to read and she was so frustrated
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.880]   that now the ink from books would make her sick.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   So as a kid,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   I would either bake her books in the oven
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.320]   to try to get that smell of new print out,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.720]   or I would put them out in the backyard
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.600]   and flip the pages throughout the day
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   so that the sun would kind of bake them.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.840]   And then I would walk up to the second floor
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.960]   and she was living in a bathroom
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.000]   that was covered with aluminum foil.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.640]   She slept on a cot
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.120]   that had been washed in baking soda 20 times.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.400]   And I remember she would open the door
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.960]   kind of with this crinkle sound,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.600]   and she would be wearing her mask and her glasses.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.720]   She'd be wearing cotton gloves.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.400]   She would take the book from me
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.040]   and she would put it inside a cellophane bag,
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.120]   shut the door,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   and then she was able to read.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.400]   So just weird, Chris.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.880]   My parents were devout Christians,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.360]   kind of non-denominational Christians.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   So they had a really authentic faith
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.120]   that they would certainly attribute
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.640]   as the only way that they stayed married
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.760]   and kept the family together.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.920]   And I was actually actively raised in the church.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.080]   So I would go on Sundays
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.440]   and I would play piano in Sunday school.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.880]   And I was just a good kid growing up.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   I didn't smoke.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   I didn't drink.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.200]   I didn't sleep around.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.080]   I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.480]   and I was gonna cure mom
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.960]   and other people I'd met like her.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.680]   So that was kind of act one.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.320]   Act two was a big detour from that.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.560]   At 18, I start acting out
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.960]   this cliche prodigal son rebellion story,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   and I grow my hair down to my shoulders.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.440]   I join a rock band and I moved to New York City.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.280]   And the band immediately breaks up
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.680]   because we all hated each other.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.840]   But I stumble into this occupation
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   in New York City nightlife.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.960]   And I realized that if a person wanted to rebel,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.640]   you could rebel in style as a nightclub promoter.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.160]   And all you had to do was get
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.560]   the right, beautiful, famous people inside the club
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.480]   alongside people with money,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.800]   and then you could sell them a $25 cocktail
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.280]   or a $1,000 bottle of champagne that cost you only 40.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   And act two, that was the next 10 years of my life
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   running around New York City packing nightclubs.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.080]   I wound up working at 40 different nightclubs,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.320]   really to the horror and sadness of my parents
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.000]   who saw their good, virginal Christian kid
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.440]   now out there smoking 40 cigarettes a day,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   doing drugs, going to strip clubs, drinking problem,
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.600]   just a total hedonistic mess.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.400]   And it was really at the end of that 10 years
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   where I realized, wow, I'm a mess.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.680]   And I've really become emotionally bankrupt,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.960]   I'm spiritually bankrupt.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.880]   I've come so far from this real foundation,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.040]   this kind of amazing foundation
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.480]   that my parents had tried to lay for me in my childhood
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.440]   as helping others, as this idea of being a doctor.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.360]   I'd served nobody but myself for 10 years.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.000]   And that really led me to this moment
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   of kind of cathartic self-discovery and saying,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.640]   I need a change, this is not working out.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.000]   And I've got to go not find a pivot here,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.160]   I need to kind of explore 180 degree change.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.840]   What's the opposite of everything
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.040]   I've been doing for 10 years?
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.120]   What's the opposite of everything
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.640]   I've been thinking and speaking?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.840]   And being a pretty radical guy, I had this one idea,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   what if I sold everything I owned
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.560]   and I volunteered for one year on a humanitarian mission?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.360]   What if I gave back one year of the 10 years
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.280]   that I'd selfishly wasted and could I be useful?
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   So it was pretty quick.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.000]   I remember from this dial-up internet cafe,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.280]   putting in all these applications
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.800]   to the famous humanitarian organizations
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.680]   I had tangentially heard of.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.200]   You know, the Save the Children's and Oxfam's
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.600]   and Doctors Without Borders
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.800]   and World Visions and Red Crosses of the World.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.360]   And then I put in my 10 applications and I waited.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.000]   And maybe no surprise to anybody listening,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.520]   I'm denied by all 10 organizations.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.160]   You know, it turns out they are not looking
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.960]   for nightclub promoters or ex-nightclub promoters
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.680]   to work alongside.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.600]   And I just remember being so sad, so disappointed,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.080]   that I thought I was ready for change.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.160]   I take this first step and nobody will have me.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   Well, I was very fortunate that there was one organization
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.240]   that actually at first denied me
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.160]   and then they were about to start their mission
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   and they couldn't fill that position.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.600]   So they went back through the rejected resumes
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.160]   and they called me up and said,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.840]   if I'm willing to pay them $500 a month,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760]   and if I'm willing to go live
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.480]   in the poorest country in the world,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.440]   a country called Liberia in West Africa,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.160]   then I could join their humanitarian mission.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.880]   And the role that they had for me was a photojournalist.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.200]   Now, I was technically not a photojournalist,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.440]   but I had gone to NYU part-time.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   I'd gotten a communications degree
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.840]   and I was a pretty decent photographer
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.200]   and a pretty decent writer.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   So my life changed so dramatically as I left nightlife
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.960]   and set foot in the poorest country in the world,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.640]   a country with no electricity, no running water,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.840]   no sewage system, no mail system,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.320]   a country that had just come out of a 14-year civil war.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.080]   And I joined this mission of humanitarian doctors
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.040]   and surgeons, people who had come from 40 countries
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.280]   to volunteer their time and offer free medical services
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.240]   to people who couldn't afford it,
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.000]   where those services didn't exist.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.880]   And that really was the beginning of Act III,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.240]   which then eventually led to my discovery
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.680]   of the need for clean water
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   and then founding Charity Water.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   - We're gonna get through to a lot of these things.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.080]   And when I think about that hard change you made,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.120]   did it really just, was something inspire you?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.920]   Did it build up over time?
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.520]   How, you know, I know countless people
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.720]   who don't feel like they're doing their life's work
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.240]   and, you know, maybe it hasn't,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   they haven't hit that moment.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.880]   Maybe they also haven't been as far from their life's work
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.600]   in their previous career as you were,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.680]   but what advice do you have for that transition point?
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   - I think it did build up over time.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.200]   And then there was this catalyst where,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.360]   I remember I started having some health issues
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.760]   and one day half my body went numb
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.040]   and I couldn't feel my hand or my arm.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.280]   I remember walking over my loft, turning on the water,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.560]   steaming hot water in the sink
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.920]   and I put my hand and arm under it
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   and I can't feel anything.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.320]   So I am convinced something is terribly wrong with me.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.640]   I have some brain tumor, I have some incurable disease
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.800]   and I'm gonna die.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.400]   And that actually led me to really consider,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.480]   you know, existential questions of the heaven and hell
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.640]   that I was raised with as a kid,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.240]   questions about legacy, questions about, you know,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.560]   did it matter that I was here at all?
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.600]   What had I done for others?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.040]   It turned out that nobody could find anything wrong with me.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.200]   So after a series of brain tests and MRIs and EKG scans,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.760]   I mean, it could have been my lifestyle
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.040]   of going to dinner at 10, going to the club at 12,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.160]   going to the after hours to do cocaine from five to noon
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.560]   and then taking Ambien, you know, 1 p.m. to come down.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.120]   It might have had something to do with my body
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.840]   just crying out and shutting down or at least half of it.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.640]   But that was an event that I think caused me
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.960]   to really stop and take stock of life and legacy
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.000]   and want to just change everything, you know,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.160]   not even get back on track, you know,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.000]   create a completely new path or a new track.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.920]   - And when you created that path,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.240]   you didn't know what it would be.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.520]   And I think a lot of people assume that
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.120]   if I don't love what I'm doing,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.280]   I need to find what I love before I can kind of make a change.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.080]   Would you argue that maybe that
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.000]   is kind of incorrect common wisdom?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.840]   - I stumbled, I completely stumbled into it.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   You know, I should say,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.440]   when I went to join this medical mission,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.720]   I quit all the stuff that I mentioned.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.600]   You know, I remember having my last cigarette.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.800]   I remember, you know,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.080]   saying I'm never going to touch drugs again.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000]   I'm never going to look at a pornographic image again.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.440]   I really want to kind of shed all of these vices
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.120]   that have gripped me for a decade.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.920]   And what was so important for me
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.800]   was also changing community and environment.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.520]   It was much easier not to smoke two packs of Marlboro Reds
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.040]   or, you know, get high
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.000]   when you're surrounded by humanitarian doctors.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.760]   Not so easy when your job is nightlife
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.720]   and filling clubs five nights a week.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.240]   So for me, I think I was so fortunate
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.880]   that the intention was there to change,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.680]   but then my environment also changed.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.200]   I don't know that I would have had the self-control
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.080]   to just quit all that stuff cold turkey
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.800]   while I'm still surrounded by, you know,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.400]   thousands of drunk partying people.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.920]   - And you probably didn't know the goal
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.760]   going into this one-year adventure
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.080]   was to get into charitable work for your life.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   - Correct, correct.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.560]   - Just to kind of reset and start over, I guess.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   - It's just where it took me.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   Yeah, and in fact, at the end of the year,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.720]   I just signed up for another year
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.280]   'cause I just didn't know what was next,
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.000]   but I wanted more life, more impact like this.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.280]   And, you know, the cool thing, Chris,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.000]   was when I landed in Liberia as a photojournalist
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.520]   for this medical mission,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.640]   I had about 15,000 emails that I brought with me.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.920]   And back then, you know, email open rates
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.440]   were close to 100%.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.200]   So I was taking this whole group of people
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   that I had invited to 40 different clubs over a decade
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.000]   and was sharing what I was seeing.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.400]   So they were living vicariously through this guy
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   that they had known and partied with
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.280]   who is now embedded with, you know,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.440]   really badass, like life-changing doctors and surgeons
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.280]   in this country, you know, that's 14 years post-war
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.520]   and with these people trying to pick up the pieces
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.400]   and serve some of the greatest needs,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.840]   like some of the greatest human needs,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.240]   you know, maybe even on the planet at that time.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.080]   So, you know, I joke that there were certainly
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.600]   a few unsubscribes in the beginning.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.440]   You know, people were saying,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.920]   "Look, that Prada party that you said,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.840]   you know, that was awesome.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.000]   That store party you threw for the opening,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.880]   you know, that MTV thing you did with Perry Farrell
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.240]   was awesome, but I'm not signing up
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.520]   for cleft lips and cleft tumors."
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.560]   That was really the small minority.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.440]   I mean, maybe the ability to tell stories visually
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.520]   of what I was seeing actually grew the list
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.440]   and people began to donate money and sponsor surgeries.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.560]   And then people began to volunteer and say,
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.240]   "Well, Scott can go and find a way to be useful."
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.760]   You know, I work at Chanel.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   I'd like some of that feeling of purpose in my life as well.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   So I was kind of able to redeem some of the things
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.520]   that I learned over those 10 years,
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.320]   even though they were directed selfishly
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.120]   or they were directed, you know, in, you know,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.960]   maybe a hedonistic way.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.920]   I think the thing that I had learned
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.840]   was how to tell stories.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.560]   You know, the story I was telling then, Chris,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.200]   was get past my velvet rope, you know,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.360]   get seen by us looking through the one-way glass,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.120]   get picked to come in,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.000]   then sit with all the beautiful, rich, famous people,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.600]   spend a whole lot of money,
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.520]   and your life has great meaning.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.560]   You have arrived.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.000]   I'd gotten so good at telling that story
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.640]   that I was just telling the wrong story.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   So when I started telling a very different story
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.240]   of doctors who had passionately given up
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.680]   their vacation time,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   who had not flown to the Four Seasons in the Maldives,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.760]   but had come to the poorest country in the world
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.440]   for a couple months to serve and get nothing in return,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.320]   people were really moved by that.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.280]   But the skill had been learned in a very different--
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.360]   - Yeah, you talked about the person at Chanel
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.320]   trying to have a bit more purpose.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.960]   At what point in time did you find
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.320]   that doing this was your purpose?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   Or I guess, what is your purpose now?
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.640]   - I think almost immediately.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   I loved it.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.400]   I mean, I remember getting asked a lot like,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.240]   "Oh, isn't it hard?
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.840]   "You're living in this 120-square-foot cabin
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.000]   "with two roommates."
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.120]   And the ship was not a cruise liner.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.360]   This was not a carnival cruise.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.680]   The thing was 53 years old,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.240]   had rats and mice and cockroaches.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   And it was a very, very old kind of broken-down ship,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.240]   which actually had to be retired a couple years later.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   But I was so inspired by being surrounded
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.200]   with people who served others.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.800]   I think it was really that simple,
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.600]   who were just asking the question,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.400]   "How can I take what I've been blessed with?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.960]   "How can I take my time, my talent, my money,
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.400]   "and use it to help others,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.240]   "use it to end some of this needless suffering
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.400]   "out there in the world?"
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.040]   So I think I was just surrounded, Chris,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.800]   with people with the exact opposite intention
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.720]   for the life I'd lived for 10 years
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.400]   and the lives of the people that I was curating
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.240]   or that I was surrounded, which was really,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.440]   how much pleasure can we bring to ourself
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.720]   at any given moment of any given day
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.080]   and all the moments of all the days
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   versus how can we help?
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.920]   How can we serve?
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.080]   And do you think that is a formula
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.320]   for a more fulfilling life?
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.560]   I'm very careful to tell others.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.600]   I mean, I think I have my personal experience.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.240]   I have found there's a real freedom
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.160]   that comes with service.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   We've had donors over the years.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.560]   Someone's about to go buy a BMW
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.880]   and will come across Charity Water
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.200]   and will buy a Toyota Prius instead
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.120]   and donate the difference
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   to go help a couple communities get access to clean water.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.800]   So I have seen sacrificial giving.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   I've seen purpose-driven work improve the lives
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.240]   of so many people now through our community.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.800]   We've had millions of donors around the world.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.720]   I believe so, certainly true for me
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.000]   and certainly true from what I've observed.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.640]   I will say, Chris, there was never enough.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.680]   Somebody always had a more beautiful girlfriend
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.880]   who was more famous.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   Somebody always had a better car, a better plane.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.480]   If I was with a group of people
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.120]   gambling $10,000 a hand at Blackjack,
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.520]   somebody else was gambling 100,000 a hand.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.960]   So it was this insatiable lust for more,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.640]   but there was no end point.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.560]   And I think looking back at that,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.080]   I mean, there was never going to be enough.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   And in fact, I still know people who are out at the clubs
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.280]   and they are now dating girls younger than their daughters.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.120]   You know, just continually looking for more,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.080]   looking for more, looking for those markers of success,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.360]   knowing that somebody's always got
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.920]   a little bit more than you.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.440]   And it's not like that when you embrace a life of service.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.120]   I guess it's more to a different degree.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920]   There's more work to be done.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.240]   One of my favorite quotes,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   somebody sent me from a New York City bodega
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.520]   like almost 20 years ago,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.480]   and it was a sign outside of Delhi that says,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.720]   "Do not be afraid of work with no end."
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.440]   And that's really how I see 17 years at Charity Water now,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.040]   is there's always another person to help.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.560]   There's always another community that needs clean water.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.360]   Let's say we get to the end of the water crisis,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.680]   which I truly believe is possible and I truly hope we do.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.800]   You know, people are always asking me,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.600]   so you're just going to put yourself out of business, right?
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.760]   Oh, Charity should put themselves out of business.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.640]   I think that's one of the stupidest concepts I've ever heard.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.120]   Yeah, if we've helped 17 million people get clean water,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.280]   if we get to 100 million served, 300 million served,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.960]   if we eradicate this problem, you know,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.400]   I would hope we would take everything we have learned
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.960]   over decades of working with donors,
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.680]   building trust, building relationship.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.640]   I would hope we'd take everything we've learned,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.120]   operating in 30 really difficult countries around the world,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.440]   and we'd say, great, everybody now has water.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.040]   What else could we do together?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.440]   What else could we do with our donors?
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.480]   What else could we do with our team members
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.560]   and all this expertise?
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.000]   Are there people hungry?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.440]   Are there people without access to healthcare?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.680]   Are there people that don't have a roof over their heads?
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.280]   Let's take everything we've learned,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.120]   let's go focus on that next critical human need
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.280]   or that next group of people who are needlessly suffering,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.240]   rather than let's drop the mic,
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.480]   shut down the organization,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.240]   and go all try to become, you know, millionaires finally.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.400]   - Well, let's talk about that because, you know,
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.920]   the mission is never ending, right?
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.400]   You've dedicated yourself and the organization you built
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.640]   to a life of service.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.920]   There's no end in sight, right?
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.720]   There will always probably be something, unfortunately,
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.880]   that the world needs to be less suffering
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.800]   and people in a better place.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   How do you make time for yourself in that world?
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.480]   How do you, you mentioned, you know,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.520]   the selfishness of your past.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.840]   Is a little bit of selfishness okay?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.160]   Can you take yourself out to dinner?
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.800]   Can you go on a vacation or, you know,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.360]   because you've been so close to it,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.280]   I can't remember the number, but it's, you know,
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.880]   a very small amount of money each month
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.840]   to provide someone with water.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.480]   So how do you not want to give everything?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.880]   - I think it's personality.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.960]   I'm both optimistic, but I'm also very pragmatic.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.680]   And I think maybe, you know,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.760]   my experience in 10 years of clubs
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   has helped me take a long view at this.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.080]   And, you know, I realized going out to dinner with my wife
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.960]   is really important.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.020]   Going out to family dinners is important for our family.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.120]   There are certain things that I try to be
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.080]   a really, really good steward of money with.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.720]   I mean, I know a lot of people, you know,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   are a fan of your travel hacks.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.600]   And we were talking about this offline before.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.200]   You know, I'm on about a hundred planes a year
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.800]   and I just fly coach.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.000]   You know, we have never used a single donor dollar
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.480]   to fly me or any other executive, you know,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.120]   or anybody at the organization in business class
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.200]   because we take that extra money,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.840]   which in my case would be, you know,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.400]   hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.080]   And we put that back in the mission.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.320]   So there are certain things that, you know,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.800]   you're taking an austerity stance on.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.160]   But, you know, there are other things that, I mean,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.680]   I think I live a pretty normal life.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.920]   You know, I've got a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   and we just had a, I have one that's nine weeks old now.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.680]   We had our surprise third.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.080]   I'm almost 50, my wife's 40, but, you know,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.600]   I really think about just making sure my kids
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.520]   are able to go play sports and live in a safe house
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.640]   in a safe neighborhood.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.560]   And, you know, when they need bikes, I go and buy them bikes.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.360]   I'm not thinking, oh my gosh,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.480]   if my nine-year-old goes without a bike,
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.320]   I can go give two more people in Africa
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.440]   access to clean water.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.400]   I think it kind of take a long, sustainable view.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.080]   If my family is healthy,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.600]   if my relationship with my wife is healthy,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.840]   you know, I'm probably going to be able to do this
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.360]   a whole lot longer and hopefully impact the lives
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.600]   of hundreds of millions of people, you know,
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   by sustaining the energy or the passion or the mission.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.800]   I'm also surrounded, you know,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   I spend a lot of time in proximity to extraordinary wealth.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.000]   And I know it does not make people happy.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.280]   I mean, I do know some of the most unhappy people I know
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.360]   are some of the wealthiest people that I know.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.280]   And just because, you know,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.200]   you've got hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.960]   or billions of dollars does not make for a healthy,
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   flourishing relationship, family, you know, holistic life.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.960]   So, there's no mystery, I think,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   around money or capital that I'm chasing anymore.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.360]   In fact, sometimes even the opposite.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.400]   - And how has that changed your own outlook
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.600]   on building, you know, your wealth or saving?
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.880]   - We have one family that gives to us
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   that I'm really inspired by.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.400]   They are a family in Texas.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.520]   They've given over $13 million to Charity Water.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.240]   And the family caps their spending at $180,000 a year.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.760]   This is a family of four.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.960]   And that's just the number that, you know,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.160]   I think the house is paid for
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.920]   and their couple cars are paid for,
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.800]   but they just don't spend any more than $180,000 a year.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.600]   And they give away everything else,
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.680]   everything from investments,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.600]   everything from, you know, he was a successful businessman.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.160]   And I'm really inspired by that.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   You know, so I kind of, I mean, I appreciate the extremes.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.680]   We were talking earlier about,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.360]   I think you've got a family member who's a Franciscan monk.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.600]   I mean, that is compelling to me.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.840]   I just don't know that I'm cut out for, you know,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   I will say this, in the fundraising business,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.880]   I find sometimes people who have a really unhealthy view
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.080]   of money will then shame people who do have money
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.640]   and they become terrible fundraisers.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   Nobody wants to be around them.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.040]   You know, you don't get invited to go on a vacation,
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.880]   you know, with somebody who has the capacity
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.360]   to give you a million dollars or $10 million
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.160]   or, you know, $50 million,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.720]   if you're going to make them feel judged,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.480]   if you're going to make them feel terrible about themselves.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.200]   So I think it's just, maybe it has to do with my past
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.240]   or what I was able to do in New York for 10 years
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.640]   or just a lot of the people
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.360]   that I'm in a relationship with now at Charity Water.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.000]   I look at wealth as an opportunity
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.920]   to do more good in the world.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.440]   Wealth as an opportunity to serve,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.920]   to put that money to work in human flourishing,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   in ending suffering.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.240]   And it's my job, when I'm around people
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.360]   who have extraordinary wealth or, you know,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.320]   middle-class wealth, to tell compelling enough stories,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.000]   to create a compelling organization
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.200]   that can be a vehicle for turning their money
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.360]   into the transformation of human life
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.480]   and then creating a circle back to them
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.960]   so that they know it happened.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.360]   And if I can do all that,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.840]   which I've been trying to do for almost 20 years,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.280]   you know, we find we're restoring
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   a lot of people's faith in charity.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   And charity means love.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.000]   It's a really beautiful word that has become something
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.920]   that many people are skeptical or cynical about.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.400]   I remember when I started, 42% of Americans,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.920]   you know, polled by USA Today,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.680]   said they didn't trust charities.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.800]   A more recent New York University study
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.680]   found 70% of Americans believe charities
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.520]   waste their money in some part, waste their donations.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.680]   So, so many of the things that we've tried to do
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.480]   at Charity Water is restore that lost faith
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   and, you know, almost get people addicted to generosity.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.200]   And it could be generosity of time.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.760]   It could be generosity of money.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.600]   It could be both.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.280]   - Yeah, I mean, the thing that I first learned
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.600]   about Charity Water that made me realize
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.280]   you guys were different is that
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.560]   you have two separate sources for money, right?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.280]   One covers all the overhead,
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.400]   all the way down to the credit card processing fees,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.840]   and then the other is just directly
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   to go towards causes and pay your money.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.440]   I mean, I think that was an intentional decision early on.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.280]   - That's right.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.760]   - How much of your success do you think
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.880]   would you attribute to, you know,
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.000]   in my mind, there's two things.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.440]   You've ran it completely differently
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.920]   and then you've become masterful at storytelling.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.520]   How do you think about those two things
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.000]   and is maybe there another thing
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.120]   that you think drove such success?
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.840]   - Well, yeah, when I started, I was 30.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.520]   I'd just come back from two years in Africa
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.760]   as a photojournalist.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.400]   And I think I had the advantage, Chris,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.480]   of not knowing anything about how to build a charity
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.360]   or run a charity.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.440]   And I didn't really know anyone in institutional philanthropy.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.920]   I know people who worked at Goldman Sachs
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   or at Sephora or at MTV VH1 at the time, everyday people.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.320]   And I remember actually going
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.080]   and buying nonprofits for dummies.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.800]   You know, the yellow book.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.480]   How do you start a 501(c)(3)?
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.720]   What is a 501(c)(3)?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.840]   Okay, we need some lawyers
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.640]   and you have to file this application
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.720]   with the federal government
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.400]   and you need a board.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.160]   I really had no idea at the beginning.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.400]   But I think that then allowed me to go out
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.960]   and do just some informal market research.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.800]   And as I talked to my friends,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.160]   they loved the noble mission
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.200]   of getting everybody on earth clean water.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.880]   I mean, everybody I talked to
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.320]   could stand for clean water for humans.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   Republicans and Democrats and people of faith
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   and people who are agnostic or atheists,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.840]   like everybody could think water is a good idea for people.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   But really this pervasive kind of underlying skepticism,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.800]   everyone also seemed to have a horror story
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.560]   of a charity gone wrong.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.480]   You know, a charity where the money didn't get
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.800]   to the people that it was intended to get to,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.000]   or a charity where they'd hired aunts and uncles
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.960]   and distant relatives and was just racked with nepotism.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.160]   So the model for Charity Water really came out
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.560]   of just listening to everyday people.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.920]   I said, "Well, what would make you compelled to give?"
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.720]   And the 100% model just came out of that.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.080]   Well, people said, "If I knew that 100% of what I gave
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.040]   "would actually help people, I'd be more likely to give."
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   I said, "All right, well, this just needs to look like
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.960]   "two separately audited bank accounts.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.600]   "And in one bank account, I'm gonna raise my hand
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.320]   "and go try to find business leaders and entrepreneurs
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.800]   "who are not skeptical and actually who wouldn't mind paying
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.240]   "those unsexy overhead costs like staff salaries
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.600]   "and office rent and phone bills
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.480]   "and the toner for the Epson copy machine
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.120]   "if they knew we were efficient with those donations
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.160]   "and transparent.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.320]   "And then I can go out to the public and say,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.120]   "Great, not your problem.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.440]   "If you give a dollar or a million dollars,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.320]   "every single penny, every dollar will go directly
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.400]   "to build these water projects
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   "which get people clean water."
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160]   And as you mentioned, you know,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.560]   so that there would be kind of perfect integrity
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.120]   with the 100% model, we said,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.000]   "Well, even pay back your credit card fees.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.720]   "If you give 100 bucks on your Amex, sadly, we get 96,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.240]   "but we will pay that $4 back from the overhead account
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   "and we'll send your $100 to the field."
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.920]   And then the second thing that came out of listening was
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.560]   people wanted just to see where their money went.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.720]   So we said, "All right, well, we're gonna prove
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.600]   "where this money goes.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.200]   "Money's not fungible.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.640]   "We can build technology in the water bank account
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   "where all the public is giving towards
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   "and we could track a $92 donation to a well in Malawi
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.480]   "or $114 donation to a spring protection in Nepal."
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.200]   And we actually became the first charity in the world
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.640]   just to geolocate all of our completed water projects
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.520]   up on Google Earth and then later Google Maps.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.400]   So there was this theme of hyper-transparency,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.280]   but, you know, again, could we wrap that with a story?
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.320]   And then the third kind of pillar was just this belief that,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.680]   yeah, I remember looking around the sector and saying,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.960]   "Where are the apples of charity?
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.240]   "Where's the Nike?
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.880]   "Where's the Virgin?"
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.000]   Or later, "Where's the Tesla?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "Where are these inspiring, imaginative, creative brands
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.440]   "that capture the imagination of people?"
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.800]   And I saw a lot of shame and guilt-based marketing.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.960]   I saw a lot of charities with bad websites
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.360]   and terrible checkout forms and PDFs
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.080]   that they expected people to read,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   you know, white papers about their issue.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.360]   So I think this just came through listening
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.880]   and these became really core distinctives for Charity Water,
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.680]   the 100% model,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.400]   always looking for ways to connect people to their money,
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.400]   proving it, trying to build this really inspiring,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.120]   design-forward brand.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.440]   And then maybe the most important thing
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.760]   was really what we wouldn't do.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.600]   We wouldn't send anyone that looked like me
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.480]   over to Africa or India or Southeast Asia to go drill wells.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.760]   And I believed just from day one
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.040]   for this work to be culturally appropriate,
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   for it to be sustainable in the long run,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.960]   it had to be led by the locals
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   in each of these countries where we worked.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.680]   And if we were successful,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.320]   we would help grow the teams of local hydrogeologists
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.720]   and local well drillers and technicians.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.200]   And as we scaled,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   we would create thousands of local jobs in the process,
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.040]   and they would be the ones leading their communities
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.840]   and leading their countries forward in the future.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.640]   They'd also be the ones getting the credit.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.480]   And that's, you know,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.520]   maybe what I've been really most proud of,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.920]   you know, 17 years later,
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.840]   we employ, you know,
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.400]   well over 2,500 people through our partner network
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.640]   now across 21 active countries.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.440]   And they are taking the money that we're raising
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.720]   and turning it into clean water
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.200]   for the people living in their communities
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.040]   in their countries every single day.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.840]   So just to kind of finish on this,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.640]   day one, I put all these things together,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.880]   and my best idea for the launch of Charity Water
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.960]   was to get a nightclub donated during Fashion Week
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.000]   and to get Open Bar donated,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.360]   and then to just email everyone I knew
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.440]   and invite them to my 31st birthday party.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.640]   And 700 people came,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   probably less for me,
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.480]   more for the club and the Open Bar.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.560]   And on their way in,
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.520]   we put out this big plexi box
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.600]   and they had to drop $20 in the box to get in the club.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.800]   And at the end of the night,
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.920]   we'd collected $15,000.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920]   And we took 100% of the money
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.680]   to a refugee camp in Northern Uganda.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.080]   We built our very first well,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.160]   and then we sent the photo, proof,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.840]   and the GPS coordinates and the satellite images
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.680]   back to the 700 people who came.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   And we said, "You came, you gave $20.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.600]   "It mattered, and here, watch, see.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.080]   "See the impact you made."
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.360]   And I mean, that sounds so simple,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.040]   but nobody else was doing that at the time.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.280]   And it turned out to be such a competitive advantage
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   in the early days.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.240]   - You had no experience in this space
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.600]   and have built, you know, not the biggest,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.640]   but definitely one of the most innovative charities
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.000]   that I'm familiar with.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.840]   I wanna jump into a few lessons
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.360]   because, you know, it seems like,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.880]   wow, you just did this one thing
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.960]   and then it took off from there.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.720]   I know you've had your fair share of setbacks along the way.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.400]   So, you know, you were passionate about this space,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.520]   but I know that takes patience and resilience.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.280]   How do you handle that?
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.960]   What advice would you give to people
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.440]   who are dealing with similar things in life,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.400]   whether it's charities or anything,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.600]   just to kind of build that resilience
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.640]   in their own pursuits?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.200]   - Well, a lot of things didn't work.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.000]   I remember, you know, the 100% model sounds great
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.400]   until you run out of people
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.200]   who are willing to pay for overhead.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.840]   So we had this moment about a year and a half in
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.800]   where we were raising so much money
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.360]   for clean water projects
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.840]   'cause the 100% model was resonating
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.280]   with the everyday public,
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.320]   but I just couldn't find people
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.840]   to hire that next incremental staff member soon enough.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.040]   And I'll never remember,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.560]   there was this really pivotal moment.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.800]   We had $881,000 in the water bank account
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.840]   that was headed out to the fields to build projects.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.800]   And we had a couple weeks left
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.280]   in the overhead account to make payroll.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.680]   And I remember the advice I was getting from people
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.600]   was to go borrow against the 881(k).
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.080]   You know, write a little IOU
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.360]   and transfer between accounts
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.600]   'cause you gotta pay your people
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.200]   and, you know, you'll figure this out later.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.160]   And I remember calling lawyers
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.240]   and I was gonna start to unwind the charity
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.600]   and just say, this doesn't work.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.960]   This is an untenable model.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.680]   You know, I guess unless you have, you know,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.320]   a huge amount of capital to start with
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.440]   or a billionaire backer.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.680]   But I remember thinking if we borrowed one penny
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.400]   of the public's money, you know,
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.560]   and violated that promise,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.960]   even if we paid it back later,
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.040]   there would just be a crack in the foundation
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:20.920]   of our integrity.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.880]   And I didn't wanna run that organization.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.960]   I would rather fail and, you know,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.680]   try again with maybe the traditional business model
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.960]   where you put all the money in one business,
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.440]   you know, one account.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.680]   And we were very fortunate at that time.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.200]   I met a young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.520]   and I remember taking a meeting with him.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.920]   He was interested in what we were doing.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.200]   And I remember thinking the meeting went terribly.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.880]   And at the end of the meeting,
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   he asked for our bank account details.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.240]   And then three days later,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.840]   he shot me a note well after midnight saying,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.200]   I enjoyed meeting you.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.320]   You know, really love the passion, love the work.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.520]   I just wired a million dollars into your overhead account.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.240]   And we went from insolvent, you know,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.400]   weeks away from insolvency
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.440]   to over a year of operating capital.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.560]   And, you know, we really never looked back.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.920]   Had that not happened,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.000]   I'm probably not having this conversation with you.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.120]   And what helped me so much was I think,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.160]   one, I fell back on our values.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.520]   And I would have been proud to hold my head high
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.920]   and shut the organization down
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.240]   and just say this didn't work,
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.040]   but at least not compromise.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.080]   And, you know, besides the money, that million dollars,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.200]   which was so needed at the time,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.040]   it was also that somebody believed in me.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.360]   And he believed that this was a tenable model.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.080]   We just needed more time.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.760]   We needed more time to work it out.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   And today, there are 131 families who pay the overhead.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.600]   And that grows every single year.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.520]   We invite 10 or 15 new people in.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.600]   And, you know, we've never really looked back
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.320]   after that moment, after that time.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.600]   That forced us to be creative.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.280]   It forced us to come up with a multi-year, multi-tier
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.440]   kind of operations giving program.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.520]   And, you know, now we have so many people
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.640]   that actually prefer to give that way.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   They would prefer to support a software engineer
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.560]   or a UI/UX designer
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.960]   than actually give directly to the water projects.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.120]   - And so now can you give money the other way?
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.080]   If you have too much in the overhead,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.240]   do you just save it for a rainy day?
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.480]   - Well, we never have too much in the overhead, Chris.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.120]   We never have too much in the overhead.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.600]   You know, that's always probably,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.800]   it's always a slightly harder proposition.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.160]   You know, but all that to say, you know,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.440]   it's, we're not going bankrupt.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.200]   You know, we're always trying to grow that group.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.880]   We're trying, that is where all the growth capital
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.720]   comes from.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.000]   So unless we grow the amount of people
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.280]   who are willing to give on that side,
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.520]   we can't grow the team.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.880]   We really can't grow, you know,
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.680]   the scale of the organization.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.120]   But, you know, I think that was one.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   I think in, you know, resiliency,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   you're talking about staying the course.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.080]   I remember seeing, so we're 17 years in,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.280]   and we've now helped 17.4 million people
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.600]   get access to clean water.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.520]   About 137,000 villages around the world.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.080]   On my bad days, I try to fill Madison Square Garden
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.480]   with 17 million people.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.800]   And you would have to build
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.520]   about a thousand Madison Square Gardens.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.920]   So, you know, Charity Water has sold out
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.840]   Staples Center or The Garden or, you know,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   O2 Arena in London about a thousand times,
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.880]   you know, to contain the amount of people
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.960]   who now have water.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.440]   99% of my time, I put that 17 million
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.080]   against the 700 million, and it's 1/40th.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.760]   Yes, two and a half percent of the way to goal,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.680]   because goal really is creating a world
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.680]   where no one drinks disgusting water.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.880]   Like no human being alive,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.840]   as we're recording a podcast,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   is risking their life, is poisoning themselves.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.080]   Simply because of the environment they were born into.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   And especially because we know how to solve this problem.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.440]   I mean, that's what makes this both wonderful
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.000]   and energizing and also frustrating,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.920]   is there are a lot of problems, Chris,
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   we don't know how to solve.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.000]   My mom eventually died of pancreatic cancer.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.920]   It was four months from diagnosis to death.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.520]   They had absolutely no idea how to help her.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.280]   We don't know how to solve ALS
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.560]   or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's yet.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.560]   We know how to solve water for people.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.080]   There's not a single one of the 700 million people out there
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.000]   where we're scratching our heads saying,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.560]   I just couldn't help them.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.840]   You know, wouldn't know how to get them water.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.520]   Now, we haven't created the will to solve the problem.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.960]   We haven't allocated the resources to solve the problem,
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.400]   but we actually know how to do it.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.120]   So, you know, I really kind of believe
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.240]   the best is yet to come.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.560]   I remember looking at a seven,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.400]   what was it?
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   It was a 27-year stock chart of Amazon.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.040]   And the quote was, had Jeff Bezos quit in year 20,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.800]   he'd only created 7% of the company's value.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   93% came in years 21 through 27.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.320]   That number may even be bigger now as a ratio.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.880]   It might be five and 95.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.520]   So I think there is an animating idea
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.920]   of just continuing to show up.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.840]   And we're in year 17 now.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   And you never know who is waiting, who is watching.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.920]   We still don't have a single philanthropist of note
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.960]   in the entire world who has raised their hand and said,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.840]   hey, I'm gonna work on water.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.320]   Y'all are working on health and education
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.680]   and women and girls and gender equality
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.000]   and economic development.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.840]   You know what?
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.960]   I found the one thing that sits underneath
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.680]   almost every problem related to extreme poverty,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.840]   and that's water.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.280]   So I'm gonna take that on.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.840]   We still don't have that.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.440]   You know, there is no Bloomberg, Gates, Elon, Bezos.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   There's nobody who's kind of raised their hand.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.560]   No corporation has raised their hand
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.680]   and made any sort of significant commitment towards this
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.480]   to really move the needle forward.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.800]   So I think as we just, you know, keep our heads down
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.560]   and every year, you know, try to grow the organization,
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.120]   grow our community, grow our impact.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.040]   We put ourselves in a situation where hopefully
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.720]   we build trust, we build credibility,
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.400]   we build the systems and the infrastructure now,
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   you know, across over 20 countries
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.960]   to be able to absorb that future interest in water
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.200]   and hopefully the future capital that comes to this space.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.080]   - I think part of the reason I am so compelled
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.240]   by the story of Charity Water is your ability to tell it,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.080]   both here in video, on your website.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.120]   Did you know how important that aspect would be
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.240]   to your success when you started?
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.480]   - I didn't, I didn't.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.440]   And I think it's a little bit innate.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.520]   I don't think in statistics, you know, they don't move me.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.360]   I really think in stories and I'm also a visual thinker.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.640]   You know, I took photos early on with Charity Water.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.760]   Now we have far better, more accomplished photographers
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.880]   who are willing to, you know, often donate their time
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.320]   and go out and document this work.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.760]   But I just think,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   I think I've realized the power of it over the years.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.160]   I mean, I'll just, I'll give you an example.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.840]   I wrote this chapter in my book,
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.920]   which was probably the most moving and devastating story,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.800]   you know, for me over 17 years.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.600]   And, you know, if I gave you the statistics,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.960]   okay, 700 million people in the world don't have water.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.320]   Women are walking hundreds of millions of hours
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.920]   every year that they're wasting.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.360]   Up to 50% of the disease in many of these countries
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.240]   is caused simply by bad water.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   Half the schools throughout the developing world
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.720]   don't have water or toilets for their students, right?
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.680]   I mean, I could, I could, I could,
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.960]   statistic after statistic, you know,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.840]   but if I told you that I was in Northern Ethiopia once
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.320]   and somebody came up to me
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.640]   in a $5 a night hotel room lobby,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.360]   kind of the restaurant lobby and said,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.040]   "Hey, you're the charity water guy.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.880]   We've heard of you.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.160]   We know the impact you're making up here.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.480]   Let me tell you a story."
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.040]   He sits down and he says, "I'm from a remote village.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.880]   The women in my village,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.760]   they used to all walk eight hours a day."
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.680]   And he goes, "There was this one woman.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.560]   And at the end of one of her walks,
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.440]   before she got home, she slipped and she fell.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.240]   And all the water that she had just walked for
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.840]   spilled out into the ground.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.600]   And she had this clay pot on her back
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.680]   and the clay pot shattered.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.400]   And there were shards all over the path."
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.720]   And he said, "She didn't go get another pot.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.680]   She didn't go back and go refill the water."
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.480]   He said, "She took a rope and she climbed a tree
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.360]   and she tied a noose around her neck and she hung herself.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's in the center of my village.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.640]   And we found her body swinging from a tree."
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.720]   And he let that sit.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.120]   And he said, "The work you're doing is important."
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.920]   And he walked back into the kitchen.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.080]   I remember thinking at first, that's not true.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.560]   You know, that's what you tell the humanitarian aid worker
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.680]   to make us feel great
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   about the work we're doing in the country.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.520]   But I think the power of story,
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.040]   you know, that nagged at me.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.440]   And a couple of months later, I told my wife,
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.640]   I said, "I need to go and see if this is true.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.920]   I need to go and see if this woman lived.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.600]   And I need to see the tree."
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.400]   And I wound up flying back to Ethiopia
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.240]   and flying up to the north and then driving four hours,
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.560]   got to the end of the road,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.520]   renting a donkey and a camel
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.560]   and putting a little backpack and tent,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.400]   and then walking nine hours over the mountains
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.560]   to reach this village.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.720]   It was called Maida.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.280]   And over the next week, I lived in this village
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.120]   and I walked in her footsteps and I met her mother.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.320]   And I met the friend, her best friend,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.520]   who walked for water with her that day.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.760]   And they had kind of split at the end of the walk,
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.960]   her friend going to her house.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.680]   And her name was Letakiros, walking towards her house.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.480]   And what I didn't know until I lived in this village
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.160]   was that she was 13 years old when she died.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.320]   I was imagining someone towards the end of her life
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.880]   when she was described to me as a woman.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.360]   She was a teenage girl.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.680]   And I saw where she got her water.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.120]   I visited her grave.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   I talked to the priest who gave her ceremony.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.440]   I interviewed her friends who told me what she was like.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.280]   She had vision.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.600]   She wanted to get out of this village.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.560]   She wanted to become a doctor, a nurse to help people.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.080]   And I remember just standing next to the tree,
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.560]   which was this frail little tree.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.000]   And there was a dirt path that ran next to the tree.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.160]   You know, imagining a 13-year-old girl's body hanging
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.320]   with a noose around her neck
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   and water off in the dust and shards of clay pot.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.280]   And it angered me.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.400]   I came back with a driving desire to do more
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.000]   because kids shouldn't be hanging themselves
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.080]   because they were born in a village without water.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.360]   And I remember the last thing just about this story,
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.920]   what struck me as I thought of, well, this is a tough story.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.440]   You know, I almost need to be careful telling the story,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.160]   but I asked her best friend,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.000]   I said, "Why do you think she took her life?"
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.360]   And her friend said, this is through a translator
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.120]   in the local language, Degrenia.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.400]   Her friend said, "Shame."
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.320]   Because it was her role to go and get the water
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   for the family.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.440]   And not only had she let the family down
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.720]   through her carelessness, slipping and falling,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.040]   she'd also broken the clay pot, which was a valuable asset.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.640]   And the shame of her failure
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.840]   would have been probably too much
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.120]   for her to go back and face her family.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.880]   So there's statistics.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.000]   And then there is the story of a real life person
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.400]   who's just one of those 703 million people
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.880]   that certainly resonated with me.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.280]   I was able to connect to the idea of shame.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.840]   I was able to connect to futility,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.680]   to a situation that you just don't know how to get out of.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.040]   So you just have to keep doing it every single day.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.400]   And wanting, Chris, to be a part of that answer
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.600]   to the next 13-year-old girl that I could get to.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.320]   - I don't even, it makes me wanna make sure
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.760]   if there's not a well in that village,
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.440]   can we start, do a fundraiser to put a well in that village?
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.840]   I'm hoping there already is.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.480]   So I hear you, the storytelling there
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.400]   pales in comparison to the numbers.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.880]   And when I think about my own ability to storytell,
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.760]   I think you're far superior and I need to work on that.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.880]   Is that something you learned?
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.080]   Is that something that was practiced?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.520]   How did you, how can you draw people in?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.000]   How can you, yeah.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.960]   - I go to the movies a lot by myself.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.840]   I mean, I think we're creatures of story.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.080]   I'm fascinated, my wife was laughing at me the other day.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.360]   I spent three and a half hours alone
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.880]   in the new Scorsese movie.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.480]   Because I grew up and I did a couple years in film school
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.800]   and I think he's a great storyteller.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.000]   So I'm constantly trying to immerse myself in stories
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.600]   that have nothing to do with charity water
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.560]   and nothing to do with our work,
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.440]   but watch people who are masters of the craft.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.520]   There's no formula.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.640]   I mean, I'm never sitting down and like saying this,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.760]   then that, then this, you know, the hero's journey,
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.600]   or I've never read Joseph Campbell's work.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.440]   I mean, I'm familiar kind of
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.080]   with the idea of the hero's journey,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.640]   but I'm a chronological thinker.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.560]   So it's kind of this, then that, then this,
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.080]   then that, then this.
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.080]   I feel like just because I put everybody
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:52.960]   on such a downer there,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.200]   I'll tell just one other kind of story
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.680]   on the opposite end of that.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.320]   One of my favorites over the years,
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.400]   and we have so many stories, myriad stories
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.760]   that we've come across of just extraordinary people
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.840]   and extraordinary lives impacted by not having water,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.400]   impacted by having water.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.680]   There's this woman named Helen
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.960]   that we met in Northern Uganda.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.600]   And Helen was, you know, kind of the end of middle age
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.960]   and she was a mom, she had a bunch of kids.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.200]   And our team was visiting Charity Water Completed Projects.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.600]   And when the community knows you're coming, Chris,
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.320]   there's a lot of fanfare.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.720]   I mean, they roll out the red carpet,
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.520]   they're bringing goats and chickens and eggs,
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.200]   and there are speeches and there's dancing
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.440]   and there's singing.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.000]   You know, there's a real honoring
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.560]   of the people who have come to, you know,
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.840]   just to learn more about the community.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.800]   So I think we, the team had done four with fanfare,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.680]   and this was like the fifth at the end of the day.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.040]   And they were trying to sneak into this village
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.560]   just to see the water point in action
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.920]   and kind of almost sneak up on it and say,
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.160]   "Hey, were people using it?
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   And what did it feel like around the well?"
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.880]   Well, Helen had somehow gotten wind.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.120]   So she leads this welcoming party of women
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.640]   and they're dancing and they're singing
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.160]   and they're welcoming the team in.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.400]   And after that stops, we sit down with Helen
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.240]   and we said, "Just tell us your story.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.320]   You know, now you have water.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.840]   It's feet from your home.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.760]   How is your life different now?"
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.000]   And Helen begins to tell us the story
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.640]   of what her life was like before.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   She used to go get 10 gallons of water.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.760]   So two kind of big yellow jugs.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.520]   Think of what you've got in your garage
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   for your riding mower or the little gas tank.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.640]   And she would carry two of these very heavy, 40 pounds each.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.240]   And she said, "Because the water was so far away,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.760]   I always had to make these choices.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   There's never enough water.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.040]   So what would I do with the water today?"
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.520]   And then she listed, "Well, I could cook.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.840]   I could clean.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.160]   I could garden.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.200]   I could wash my kids' bodies.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.640]   I could wash my kids' school uniforms."
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.680]   And she said, "There was just never enough water."
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.800]   And she said, "As a Ugandan woman,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.560]   we put our families first."
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.520]   She said, "Now that I have clean water, feet from my house,"
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.600]   she said this, she said, "Now I am beautiful."
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.840]   And our team didn't quite get it.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.760]   We're like, "Helen, of course,
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.920]   you're this beautiful Ugandan woman."
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.560]   And she goes, "No, I don't think you understand."
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.600]   She goes, "Now I finally, for the first time in my life,
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.840]   in this village, have enough water to wash my face
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.440]   and my body and my clothes."
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.800]   And she said, "I am beautiful."
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   She said, "Look at me, I'm looking so smart."
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   And we'd never quite thought of water in that way before
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.200]   until we sat down with a woman
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.760]   and just listened to her simply tell her story.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.080]   And water to her meant dignity.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.400]   Water meant beauty.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.560]   We'd been talking about water as health
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.840]   and rattling off statistics of disease
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.920]   and water is educated.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.800]   Water to her meant something deeply personal.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.720]   And when I tell that story, for me,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.200]   it also, what an extraordinary thing
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.480]   to be able to give a woman,
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.000]   especially a woman who is sacrificially giving
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.920]   for her family.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.640]   She wasn't using the water for herself.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.560]   She was using her limited water
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.320]   that she was walking hours for, for others,
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.720]   for the benefit of others.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.760]   And now she finally had enough to take care of herself.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.360]   I mean, who doesn't want to be a part of that?
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.080]   - Yeah, it's, I don't even know what to say.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.640]   I feel like just personally, I'm not going to keep this in.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.240]   I'm like, I'm more interested in an interview
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.640]   that I'm like, I'm not sure there's the tactics.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.720]   Like, I just want to keep talking.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.080]   So that's between us and I guess my editor.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.480]   Well, here's what I think I'll say.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.560]   I feel like what you've just given everyone listening
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.320]   is not only an incredible story about water
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.600]   and the impact it can have,
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   but an example of how taking the time to pull stories,
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.760]   whether it's from your life,
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.160]   whether it's from the lives of people that you work with,
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.600]   the companies you work with,
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.120]   and turning them into something that's not tangible,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.520]   instead of figures or facts.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.040]   And I so often default to the transactional information
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.840]   like, oh, water could give someone this, this, this, this.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.920]   And I just need to stop and pause in the future
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.400]   and really realize that taking the time to tell that story,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.720]   which you'd think as someone
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.480]   who talks to a microphone for a living
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.360]   would kind of innately have as a common practice,
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.440]   but I just think if there's a lesson
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.600]   that I've taken away from the last few minutes,
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.480]   it's just how powerful that can be
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.600]   and how it's not limited to someone in your role.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.480]   It's not a skill that only matters
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   if you're raising money.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.440]   It's something that probably matters in all aspects of life.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.280]   - That's right.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.660]   I mean, some of the greatest entrepreneurs are storytellers.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.760]   It has to be true.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.240]   I'll say that, Chris, it has to be true.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.080]   - Yes.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.600]   - I mean, I think sometimes there can be over embellishment
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.800]   and people can get really carried away.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.600]   So, you know, a story is powerful when it is true
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.800]   and often the details in a story, you know, make it true.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.480]   It would not have been true for me
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.460]   had I not lived in Leta Quiros's village,
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.960]   had I not stood next to that tree,
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.400]   had I not walked in her footsteps down the ravine,
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.320]   had I not talked to the other women
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.040]   at that same source of water.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.160]   So, you know, for me, the proximity
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.720]   and the immersion to the story was really important.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.800]   And then the details emerge from those,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.360]   which I think, you know, can really move people
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   because the details also remind people that it's true.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.000]   It's not a general, the specificity.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.960]   You know, Helen, I mean, I have a picture of her
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.180]   in her dress.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.640]   So if I were to do this on stage,
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.840]   I would show you Helen dancing
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.140]   and I would show you the two yellow cans.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.880]   And then I would show you a portrait we took of Helen
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.160]   as she is radiantly beaming.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.300]   And you would look at her green kind of paisley dress
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.400]   and you would notice, wow, it really does look clean.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.480]   I can't see any dirt on that.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.160]   So I think showing as well as telling
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.040]   is often really, really important.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.160]   - And it's not just for story.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.600]   I mean, let's take an example.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.580]   You've taken a lot of these stories and made videos,
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.700]   put them on the site.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.640]   I'm referencing one in particular
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.280]   that you happened to share before we got started,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.700]   the financial impact to the organization
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.600]   of telling these stories is also great.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.840]   So it's not just storytelling for storytelling sake.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.260]   The time you spend in that village,
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.200]   which I think sometimes comes across as not from you,
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.160]   but like you're brainstorming these ideas
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.800]   and you're like, do I really want to spend a week
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.000]   of my life collecting a story?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.080]   And I think one thing I've taken from our conversations,
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.000]   the value of that story could be even greater
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.360]   than the time you spent collecting.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.200]   - I agree.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.040]   I agree.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.320]   I mean, look, stories can move people.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.460]   I mean, I really think about storytelling
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.020]   is are we bringing out,
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.900]   is this story going to bring out something valuable
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.020]   in the people that might encounter it?
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.220]   I'll just give you one other example.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.280]   We'll probably talk about the film
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.700]   that the people could go actually see some of these images,
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.920]   but there's a famous donor story
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.540]   where there was a nine-year-old girl
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.300]   named Rachel Beckwith in Seattle, Washington.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.460]   And she saw me talk.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.780]   And at the time I would ask everyone in the audience
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.300]   to donate their next birthday to Charity Water.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.480]   And I'd say, you don't need any more stuff.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.000]   You don't need toys.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.640]   You know, women, you don't need handbags.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.880]   Guys, you don't need wallets.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.400]   Like we have enough stuff.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.200]   Humans don't even have water.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.800]   So turn your birthday into a giving moment.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.400]   And I thought the sticky marketing message would be
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.920]   ask for your age in dollars.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.440]   So if you're turning nine, ask everyone for $9.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.800]   If you're turning 89, ask everyone for $89.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.320]   And Rachel took me seriously at this
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.640]   and she donates her ninth birthday
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.780]   and she sets a goal of $300,
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.640]   which was gonna help the time 10 people get access to water.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.800]   And she cancels her birthday party, won't accept gifts,
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.140]   and she raises $220.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.840]   So she falls short in her goal and she tells her mom,
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.240]   she feels like she's failed
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.640]   and she's gonna try harder next year.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.520]   And her mom's like, hey, I think you're pretty awesome.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.960]   I mean, you raised $220 and just, you know,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.000]   you care so much about people you've never met
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.400]   living an ocean away.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.760]   I mean, we should all be inspired by you.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.200]   Well, right after her birthday, she dies in a car crash.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:06.480]   There's a 25 car pile up on an interstate in Seattle.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.080]   She's the only fatality, tractor trailer, jackknifes.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.160]   Her mom was driving, her sister was in the front.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.240]   She was smashed in the backseat.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.320]   And I was in Africa at the time.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.560]   I was in Central African Republic.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.920]   I remember landing the next day at JFK,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.440]   turning on my phone, the BlackBerry at the time.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.200]   And her pastor had emailed me to let me know
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.800]   of this little girl in his Seattle congregation
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.440]   who had donated her birthday, had raised $220,
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.480]   and then had passed away.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.240]   And he asked me, could we reopen her campaign?
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.560]   And he was gonna just ask everybody in the church
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.000]   to donate $9.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.360]   Long story short, people get wind of this campaign.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.280]   And a lot of people, Chris, donate $9.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.320]   And it spreads to the New York Times,
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.440]   and Nick Kristof picks it up.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.120]   It spreads to the morning shows,
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.160]   starts spreading to Europe.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.960]   And then one of the coolest things was people in Africa
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.000]   start donating $9 in Rachel's name.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   She goes from $220 to $1.3 million in donations.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.840]   She inspired almost 60,000 complete strangers to give.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.680]   And what was even cooler was so many of those givers
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.800]   then went on to donate their next birthday
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.640]   that inspired by this sacrificial nine-year-old girl
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.440]   who really should want toys or Taylor Swift cons,
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.640]   whatever the thing that a nine-year-old
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.560]   should want for themselves.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.800]   I think it so inspired 60,000 people.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   They said, not only can we give to honor her last wish,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.760]   but we could also follow the lead of a nine-year-old girl.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.280]   And I think that story, as tragic as it is,
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.800]   has put so much good into the world,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.960]   beyond the 100,000 people that now have clean water.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.560]   I mean, she wanted to help 10 people while alive.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.000]   She's now brought clean water to well over 100,000 people,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.400]   actually got to take her mom and her grandparents
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.440]   on the one-year anniversary of her death,
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.360]   took them to Ethiopia,
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.800]   and they went village to village to village to village.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.280]   And they personally met thousands of people
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.480]   who had clean water because of their daughter,
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.640]   because of their granddaughter.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.320]   But I think that story is good in the world.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.760]   And maybe people have heard that story,
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.520]   didn't even donate a birthday to Charity Water,
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.360]   but they donated it for some other cause
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.160]   or for cancer research or to build a school.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   - I know the part of this story that changed for you
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.360]   was when you took this trip.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.960]   And you just talked about taking Rachel's family on a trip.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.360]   How much of the perspective from travel
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.760]   and seeing people in other cultures and other circumstances
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.240]   has given you the perspective and gratitude you have?
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.720]   And how valuable do you think that is as a mechanism
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.680]   for changing anyone's perspective?
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:49.800]   - Chris, I get asked a lot,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.400]   having done this for close to 20 years,
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   what keeps you going?
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.040]   Like, how can you still kind of get up
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.800]   and just do this day in and day out?
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.400]   The travel is a piece.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.880]   So I make sure, it's never too long
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.840]   before I am in the ground in these communities,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   sorry, on the ground in these communities,
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.040]   connecting with the people we are hoping to serve
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.240]   and the people we're serving.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.040]   So that grounds me, it roots me.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.640]   I've been to Africa more than 55 times now.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.000]   I've been to 72 countries around the world.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.360]   And living in these villages,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.960]   I just got to take my six and eight-year-old
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.360]   this March for the first time to Uganda,
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.520]   which is where Charity Waters' first well was.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.720]   And I had my kids carrying water.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:35.440]   I had my kids asking questions of communities.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.160]   And my kids are born into a middle-class life.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.120]   They will never have to drink dirty water
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.320]   as long as they live.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:44.480]   And I wanted to share that experience with them as well.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.600]   And I got to bring some of our major donors' kids
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.440]   as well on that trip.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.800]   And it was just really impactful.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.960]   So for me, it is very, very important.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:56.560]   Bryan Stevenson at AGI talks a lot about proximity.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.600]   There's a power, there's a credibility
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.440]   that comes when you are in proximity to your issue,
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.400]   to the passion and the purpose.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.440]   I had that proximity for the first two years
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.400]   on that mercy ship, embedded with these doctors.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.120]   I had the proximity because I was scrubbed up
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.960]   with a camera in an eight-and-a-half-hour surgery,
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.880]   watching them remove a tumor
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.280]   or put somebody's body back together
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   who had been burned by rebel soldiers during the war.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.400]   And I think that has helped.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.280]   So I'm always looking for that
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.600]   and trying to make sure that I'm never too far away
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.280]   from the issue that I'm advocating for
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.120]   or the people who we're serving.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.320]   And obviously travel to Africa with kids
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.040]   is a big trip that not everyone can take.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.440]   What other things are you doing as a father
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.200]   or even for yourself to kind of create
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.880]   that culture of gratitude, of selflessness,
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.000]   of generosity, of giving in your family?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   I like that you started with gratitude
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.640]   because that is the one practice
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.720]   that I am very faithful to with the kids.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.600]   So we play the gratitude game every night.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.960]   We go around.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.520]   If I'm doing bedtime alone without my wife, it's 30.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   So everybody's got to do 10 and you can have one repeat.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.360]   So we're looking at 27 unique things
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.560]   that we're grateful for every single night.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.440]   And sometimes if it's an early bedtime,
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.200]   I'll push them to do 20.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.080]   And just the practice of...
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.000]   And sometimes you get like, I'm thankful for mom,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.120]   I'm thankful for the dog, I'm thankful for our house,
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.320]   I'm thankful for church, I'm thankful for...
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.120]   But I've gotten some unbelievably creative,
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.480]   really profound things out of the kids
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.720]   and I think even out of myself,
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.360]   things that have kind of surprised me
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.280]   when you really go into that posture of gratitude.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.960]   So that is one practice that I think
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.920]   has really enriched the lives of our family.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.040]   I think, right, not everybody can take a trip.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.280]   And I mean, we got back, my wife's like,
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.640]   I'm never doing that again.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.120]   I mean, seven flights in seven days, time zones,
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.560]   14 hours on Emirates through Dubai,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.640]   the back of the bus was all coach, yeah.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.880]   Actually, that was seven out and coach,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.200]   seven out and back and coach with kids, it was rough.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.240]   But we would have not traded that experience
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.120]   and of course, we would have done it again.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.320]   I think my wife would have done it again too.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.680]   - When it comes to the charitable world,
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.360]   I feel like I don't have the perspective you do
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.560]   and you've gotten to know this industry
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.040]   probably much more than most people.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.600]   I'm curious, as people think about causes
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   they wanna support, obviously, you'll encourage them
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.360]   to take a look at what you're doing and I will as well.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.560]   What advice do you have for people when they find a cause
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.760]   in actually finding the right organization?
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.440]   As much as I love the 100% model,
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.840]   I think it's fairly unique.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.280]   And so finding the right organizations can be tough.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.400]   And I know in the recent past with different disasters
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.440]   and war zones, people have made these lists
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.960]   of 20 different organizations,
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.680]   but it seems very hard to kind of evaluate an organization
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.600]   in the nonprofit sector.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.200]   - I think it starts with finding causes
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.840]   that you're passionate about, learning about those causes,
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.800]   maybe more than what you're asking ChatGBT
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.520]   or browsing one article, educating yourself on these causes
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.720]   and then trying to research organizations
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.120]   that are well-run and are transparent.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.760]   I certainly do not think,
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.040]   in fact, I don't even advocate other people
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.440]   starting charities to adopt the 100% model.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.160]   It was right for us 17 years ago.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.560]   It continues to be right for us going forward.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.680]   But what I really was trying to say back then
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.440]   is people just wanna know where their money's going.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.760]   Yeah, they just wanna, they want transparency in that.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.360]   You know, if I told your listeners today
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.480]   that the greatest need at Charity Water
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.400]   was a new expensive copy machine
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.000]   because we needed to print a bunch of paper copies
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.560]   and it was gonna be $3,000 or something,
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.360]   people would donate for a copy machine to meet a need,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.520]   to meet a specific need
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.200]   if they knew how that would move the mission forward.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.320]   We don't need a copy machine,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   but you could argue that'd be like the unsexiest cost ever
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.160]   is like something that prints paper.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.600]   But if those papers were valuable
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.080]   to the continuation of the mission, people would step up.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.040]   It's often, I think, the opacity,
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.640]   it's the not knowing where the money goes.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.160]   You know, it's the fine print during many of the disasters
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.120]   where you find out actually $100 million
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.040]   that was given went into an endowment,
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.760]   which won't see the light of day
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.360]   because in that fine print, the organizations say,
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.320]   well, if we over-raise what we can spend,
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.600]   you know, we can do anything with this money.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.440]   I remember to that end,
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.520]   there was a very famous example years ago
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.880]   during the tsunami, I believe it was,
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.320]   where Doctors Without Borders over-raised significantly.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.520]   And they tried to refund everybody's money.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.120]   And they tried to say, here, take your money back.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.600]   We got what we needed.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.320]   Can't spend it in this intended way.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.880]   And what do you think 99% of people did?
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.160]   Said, keep the money.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.720]   But thank you for telling us.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.120]   You know, so that move would have built so much trust
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.800]   because it was integrity in that move.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.600]   There was transparency in that move.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.720]   And I think that's often what, you know,
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.560]   is lacking sometimes in the sector,
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.880]   where when you really follow the dollars,
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.080]   you know, you're not always thrilled
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.520]   with what happened with them.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.840]   - And how would the average person go through that process?
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.880]   Like, what would you practically--
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.560]   - You'd read a 990, which is one.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.400]   So you'd read a 990.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.560]   I mean, every organization publishes their 990,
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.920]   so you can see how they're spending their money,
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   how much on marketing, how much on office costs.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.920]   You know, you can really see where the money is going out.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.640]   And I mean, so that's one document.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.080]   I mean, a lot of organizations that don't put that up online.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.680]   So that's one flag.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.920]   Somebody sent me, you know, due diligence.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.200]   Oh, check out this organization.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.080]   I said, well, they've been around for seven years.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.600]   They haven't posted a single financial online.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.520]   You know, that's not even legal.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.080]   So a charity is forced to publish their federal filed,
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.640]   it's like your tax return, every single year,
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.120]   and that needs to be found online.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.920]   So there's actually a lot of just simple best practices
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.000]   that aren't happening.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.320]   I'm a big Dan Pallotta fan.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.680]   So I am, if people don't know him,
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.720]   he gave a very famous TED Talk on kind of the overhead myth.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.360]   He wrote a book called "Uncharitable."
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.400]   He's got a film coming out in the next month or so.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:31.040]   And I am not an advocate for these tiny overheads.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.320]   I'm really an advocate for well-run efficient organizations
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.720]   who are growing their impact,
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.080]   who are trying to put more and more money, you know,
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.240]   out into the field or directly to the cause.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.920]   And that is driving everything at the organization.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.080]   - Yeah, if you looked at their 990 trend,
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:50.920]   and it's like, well,
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.480]   they spent a lot on overhead for two years.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.120]   And then in the third year, they, you know,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.320]   20X the amount of money they could raise.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.080]   That's, it wasn't necessarily a bad sign
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.800]   that they had a lot of overhead for a few years.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm a, I'm, you know,
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.240]   the Wounded Warrior story is probably the most famous.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.400]   I remember, you know,
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.120]   they were much vilified for a long time.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   And I sat with Steve Nardizzi once,
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.880]   who was their kind of co-founder.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.360]   And the way that he explained it to me was so simple.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.840]   He said, "I took this organization over,
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.320]   and we were raising $8 million a year for, you know,
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.280]   for veterans."
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.400]   And I might get this slightly wrong,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.160]   but he said $8 million was not even a fraction
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.320]   of what was needed.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.720]   And I learned that, you know,
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.880]   every dollar I would put into marketing,
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.840]   I could return about 50 cents.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.520]   So that sounds, whoa, horribly inefficient.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.400]   But he said, "I wanted to market and grow the organization.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.840]   And then I would kind of worry about efficiency later
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.200]   when we got up to scale."
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.040]   And I think he took the thing to 450 million.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.280]   Now, again, I don't remember the exact ratio,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.800]   but let's say at 450 million,
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   half of the money was going directly to help veterans.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.640]   Well, he just took an efficient organization
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.400]   at 8 million going out to, you know,
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.040]   you could argue a much less efficient organization,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.040]   but $225 million was going out in impact.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.280]   And I think he never really got the chance with his team
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.520]   to dial it back down and go back to efficiency at scale,
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.480]   which was going to be possible
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.600]   because so many of those people were monthly givers.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.960]   So there was a high cost to acquire,
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.640]   but then you got a long tail.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.000]   So when you shut off that marketing spend, you know,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.800]   and by the way, I mean, Disney Plus,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.400]   like they went from zero to 100 million users,
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.280]   I think in the first year,
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.320]   just by spending billions and billions of dollars
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.160]   of marketing.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.320]   Well, that's not how, you know,
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.480]   we're not seeing that same marketing blitz
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.080]   in year two and year three.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.160]   So I'm with you that I believe that these are often
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.280]   really wise investments that people need to make.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.960]   But you know, you ask these questions
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.760]   and you start to really understand
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.000]   more about the organization's leadership,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.480]   more about their history.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.200]   You can make some pretty good decisions
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.880]   with some more information.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.640]   - And are any of these sites that provide ratings,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.120]   I'm sure maybe you don't want to speak ill of them,
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.680]   but how much faith do you put in your own research
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.560]   versus the rating from a charitable rating site?
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.960]   - Yeah, well, we've been fortunate.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.360]   I mean, we've had the highest ratings from all the sites.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   I am very cynical about the methodology.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.360]   I mean, it's just a formula.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.240]   You know, it's a 990 is getting put through
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.880]   a variety of metrics.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.240]   And it's, I think that's a whole nother podcast.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.040]   I'm like, man, do I want to even open that?
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.400]   I think they are a good place to start.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.240]   They're certainly a good place to start
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.800]   maybe weeding out some of the egregious actors.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.680]   But is that, it's looking at overhead.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.280]   It's looking at some very simple metrics
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.320]   that is not necessarily an indicator
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.160]   of the impact they are having
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.520]   by moving their mission forward in the world.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.640]   And simply because it can't.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.400]   I mean, there's one and a half million charities
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.240]   or something in America.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.640]   So, you know, imagine it's the same thing
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.480]   with like the IRS.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.440]   Like imagine assigning, you know, 1.4 million, you know,
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.600]   let's go do deep dives in all these organizations.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.040]   It's just, it's not even feasible.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.400]   - So I know a big part of what you guys have done well
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.320]   is around tracking your impact
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.360]   and effectiveness as an organization.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.560]   I'm curious if you've ever thought about that perspective
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   on a personal level and how you or anyone listening
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.640]   might be able to apply some of those lessons
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   to track the impact they're having with their own lives
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.800]   or with their own wallets or in their own careers.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.200]   - I mean, Chris, I'm probably a bad guy
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.160]   to ask that question to,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.440]   because my KPIs are pretty simple
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.720]   because this is my life's work.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.960]   It's people that have access to clean water
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.720]   because of the organization we're built,
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.920]   because of the movement that we are growing
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.760]   and how effectively we're deploying capital to change lives.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.600]   So we have a pretty simple output.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.320]   I have a personal goal of helping
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.280]   at least 100 million people.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.400]   So that is a benchmark that's out there for me.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.760]   And, you know, we've helped 17 million people.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.040]   So if we continue to this path,
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.400]   I would be probably far too old to realize that.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.880]   So some exponential growth is certainly required
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.640]   to achieve that personal goal through work.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.320]   When I think about my family, it's all about character.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.040]   It's all about virtue.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.440]   It's instilling compassion, integrity, generosity
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.480]   into the lives of my children.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.040]   Do they tell the truth?
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.840]   Do they admit when they're wrong?
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.960]   I mean, it's all kind of soft stuff.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.920]   I can care less if they come and work with me
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.520]   or, you know, go work at a bank.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.040]   I'm really interested in the people that they become
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.840]   and the way that they do things, whatever they do.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.000]   You know, are they doing it with the utmost integrity?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.360]   You know, are they doing it by telling the truth?
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.240]   Are they treating people with kindness and respect?
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.720]   So I think two very different metrics.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.560]   You know, obviously I'm trying to do the same thing
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.760]   as we build the culture of the organization.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.400]   Are we living up to our values?
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.320]   Are we, you know, are we kind of good
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.720]   all the way to the core?
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.600]   You know, is there anything that is not working
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.560]   that we need to go and fix?
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.400]   Is there anything that's hypocritical?
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.440]   You know, are we saying anything
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.000]   that we actually can't deliver on?
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.800]   So we're constantly asking ourselves those questions
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.120]   as a culture as well.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.520]   - You mentioned legacy a bit earlier,
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.200]   and I know Charity Water's work
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.560]   has had a lasting impact on communities.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.480]   And in a way, that impact is part of your legacy.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.920]   I'd love to explore this concept
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.800]   of leaving a meaningful legacy
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   and making a lasting difference in the world.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.400]   And is that something you think about a lot?
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.160]   - It's interesting.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.760]   I probably think about it less for me
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.160]   and more of encouraging other people to think about it.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.400]   But I guess I would think about it as it's really positional
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.720]   or it's an intention of a life.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.000]   I don't think legacy is like,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.680]   okay, well, I tick these five boxes
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.720]   or, you know, they're gonna read at my funeral, A, B, C, D.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.920]   I think of it more as going through life
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.560]   and really just, I mean, I said this earlier,
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.200]   but asking the question, how can I take what I have,
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.040]   what I've been blessed with?
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.480]   I mean, everybody listening to this has been blessed,
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.160]   has certainly many things to be grateful for.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.400]   And how can I use that in the service of others?
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.720]   I think it's that simple.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.600]   And that is really then a legacy of giving.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.280]   It's a legacy of compassion.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.200]   It's a legacy of generosity that will manifest itself
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.520]   in different ways through different seasons of life.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.280]   I mean, one of my dreams at some point
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.960]   is to write a million dollar check to a charity.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:44.240]   I have wanted to pay back or pay that forward for 17 years.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.400]   You know, we've been able to turn that million dollar gift
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.000]   into now, you know, well over $800 million raised.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.240]   And I think I was able to give that back to that donor
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.840]   saying you believed in me.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.360]   We've honored this 100% model with absolute integrity
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.960]   now for 17 years, and we've kind of turned that one talent
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.440]   into 800 more and growing.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.360]   But I'd like to do it personally, Chris.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.280]   You know, and we're not going to do it
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.480]   through my salary at Charity Water,
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   but I'd love to not just give advice,
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.680]   not just fund water projects across 21 countries.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.560]   It'd be fun to write a check and change the game
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.000]   for a small charity the same way somebody changed the game.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.840]   So, I don't know if I'll ever get the opportunity
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.400]   to do that, but I think, you know,
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.440]   if I came into money in some way
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440]   where I had the ability to do that,
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.680]   I'd be more likely to do that than to try
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.780]   to go blow a million dollars on, I don't know.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.160]   I mean, I guess it doesn't buy that much anymore,
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.520]   but you know, rather than trying to upgrade myself
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.400]   to business class flights for the next, you know,
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.480]   five years or something.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.960]   I'd want that to be useful.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.320]   - This has been amazing.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.160]   I appreciate you sharing your story
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.480]   and the story of Charity Water with everyone here.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.560]   We didn't even mention where people can find
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.920]   that video we referenced earlier.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.640]   So, maybe let everyone know
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.860]   where we want to send them right now.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.760]   - I think, you know, people want to know more.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.920]   If you'd like to see the video or, you know,
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.520]   you're looking for some way to get involved with us,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.800]   probably the best place to go is The Spring.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.880]   It's thespring.com.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.000]   It's where that video lives.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.160]   It's had over a hundred million views now across platforms.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.800]   And The Spring is just very simply an online community
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.760]   of people who show up every month.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.040]   It's like Netflix, you know, or Spotify,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.400]   you pay them every month,
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.160]   except we will not send you any music for free.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.440]   We will not send you any TV or movies.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.720]   We will take a hundred percent of your money every month
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.840]   and we will turn it into clean water
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.520]   for people in need around the world.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.200]   And, you know, I was actually with Daniel Ek in Ethiopia
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.360]   who founded Spotify and, you know,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.280]   was helping me kind of move
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.720]   a lot of our one-time giving to subscription.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.440]   And that idea and that community
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.320]   has been really transformative.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.960]   We tripled the organization's impact since we started that.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.760]   And, you know, the average is, you know,
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.280]   it's $40 to give one person clean water.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.440]   So there's probably a lot of people listening, you know,
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.720]   who could donate $40 a month
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.560]   and not even really feel that pain,
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.440]   but know that every single month
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.800]   one more person is getting access to clean water.
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.600]   So I guess, you know, if I had one ask of people to consider,
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.400]   yeah, there's people that give $10 a month
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.520]   that are broke college students.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.280]   We have people in their nineties on their pensions
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.400]   who give $10 a month.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.200]   And every four months,
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.840]   a person moves from dirty water to clean water,
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.080]   which is a real big impact.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.280]   So, you know, you could check out the video,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.720]   share it with your friends.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.520]   You know, a lot of the images, Rachel stories in that video,
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.080]   you get to see what she looked like
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.840]   and just some really cool stuff and images in there.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.680]   - Well, Scott, I appreciate you being here.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.400]   I've been a charity water supporter throughout the years
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.440]   and will continue to be.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   Thank you for joining me.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.280]   - Thanks for having me.
