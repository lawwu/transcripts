[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   How good do I look? I'm so sunkissed.
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.000]   How many buttons down are you?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   Oh, my God, I have three buttons.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.740]   OK, three buttons.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.700]   No, look, look, look, look.
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.480]   Is there a button below that we can't see?
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.440]   No pants!
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   No pants either?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.980]   Are you free buttoning and free balling it?
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.240]   Is both happening or what?
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.980]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.780]   Don't let your winners ride.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120]   Rainman David Sasson.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.920]   And it said, we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.420]   Love you guys.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.220]   Ice Queen of Kinwan.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.360]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.120]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.220]   Welcome back to the All In Pod.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.120]   This week, our hostess with the mostest,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.400]   Jkal is out with COVID, getting treated,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.260]   spending the day in bed.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.360]   We wish him well.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   We wish him a speedy recovery.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.540]   We are going to plow forward like all championship teams do.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.280]   This week, I think we're going to kick it off with a conversation
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.240]   about the election update.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.780]   Obviously, Harris came out, guns ablazing in the media.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.220]   The accolades seem to be flying.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.260]   And the polling data is starting to become worrisome,
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.160]   it seems, for the Republicans.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.260]   Just this week, Nate Silver released his newest model update.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.400]   The Silver Bulletin, I think he's got it
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.180]   trademarked as nowadays.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.140]   And in the model, he tries to estimate what does the polling data show us
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.980]   with respect to the Electoral College
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.540]   and the popular vote in the upcoming presidential election?
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.520]   Harris currently has a 42.5%
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.020]   probability of winning the Electoral College.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.400]   Trump, 56.9%.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.160]   Kennedy coming in at 0%.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.800]   On the popular vote,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.000]   Harris has a 57.1% probability of winning the popular vote,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780]   42.9% probability for Trump.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.880]   I guess I'll start it off with David Sachs.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.280]   Sachs, given the momentum coming out of the gate
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.480]   since the announcement of Harris as the Democratic nominee
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.360]   and this recent polling data,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020]   what's your read on the landscape today?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.720]   What's your read on where we stand and what's ahead here?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.860]   And what do you take away from these polls?
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.600]   Well, look, I think what happened is that
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   Biden dropped out of the race, he abdicated,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Harris took over,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.300]   and it created a sense of euphoria on the part of the left
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.240]   because they thought they had a surefire loser with Biden
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.400]   and they were divided.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.980]   And then once Harris replaced him,
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.680]   they thought, OK, now we got a shot and we can fully unify
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.340]   and get behind this new candidate.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.960]   So what you've seen is over the past couple of weeks,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.860]   the mainstream media has gone all out
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.620]   on behalf of Kamala Harris.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.820]   And yes, this has led to a rise in the polls,
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.160]   but I think that the highs that Trump were at
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   were always a little bit artificial in the sense
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.040]   that if the Democrats could field a candidate
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.540]   who could campaign,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.380]   it was always gonna be a close election.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.180]   Biden was artificially depressed in the polling
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.120]   because he just couldn't campaign.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   He could barely read from a prompter,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.620]   he couldn't do interviews.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.180]   So I think you're seeing the race normalizing.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.220]   This is gonna be a close one.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.180]   It's gonna be a nail biter.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.380]   But I think the question about this honeymoon period
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.860]   that Harris has right now is whether it's sustainable.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.960]   I mean, she has not done any press interviews.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.400]   She has not done any press conferences.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.040]   She's not answered one question.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.440]   She's not been asked one tough question by the media.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.260]   She has only read from a teleprompter.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260]   She's only done scripted appearances.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.460]   And yet at the same time,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.040]   she's basically been changing all of her policy positions
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.640]   and running from every position she ever stood for.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.080]   So for example,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.140]   she said that she was in favor of single payer.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.540]   Now she's against it.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.380]   She said she was in favor of court packing.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.780]   Now she's against it.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.480]   She said she was against fracking.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.420]   Now she's in favor of it.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.260]   On the border,
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260]   she said that we should consider abolishing ICE.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.100]   Now all of a sudden,
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.860]   she's in favor of more funding for border patrol.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.860]   On crime,
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.260]   she used to take kind of the BLM position
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.440]   that cops don't make us safer
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.320]   to now she's saying that she's a cop
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.040]   and prosecutor herself.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.020]   She used to be in favor of federal gun buybacks.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.360]   Now she's against them.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.380]   It just goes on and on.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.660]   I mean, in the 2020 riots,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.860]   she raised money for the legal defense of rioters.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.300]   Now she's distancing herself from those positions.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   My point is this,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.820]   is that after spending really her whole career
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.060]   staking out positions on the far left,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.640]   she has now dropped all of these positions
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.940]   for political expediency.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.540]   And the question is,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.100]   what does she stand for at all?
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.460]   Does she just kind of blow with the wind
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.220]   and say whatever helps her
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.940]   win whatever the next election is?
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.720]   I mean, I think that's basically what's going on here.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.420]   And normally what happens is
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.000]   the press would ask you that question,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.940]   but she's been getting a free pass
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.020]   because the mainstream media has basically been operating
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.820]   as a division of the DNC
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.260]   and they're not holding her to account in any way.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.740]   They're not requiring her to answer any questions.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.260]   And as a result, yes,
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.600]   you're seeing this bounce in the polls.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.180]   But I think the question is,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.820]   can she sustain this for 100 days?
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.180]   Can she really get through the entire election
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.500]   without having gone through a primary,
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.620]   without ever having to explain her positions on issues?
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.740]   And she just does these short scripted appearances.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.660]   I just think that at some point over the next 100 days,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.940]   that approach is just gonna fall apart.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.380]   She's gonna have to do a debate.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.860]   She's gonna have to answer questions.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.300]   At that point, I think the bloom
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.860]   will come off the rose a little bit here
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.140]   and you'll see the polls normalize.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.100]   - Do you think that J.D. Vance
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.400]   has negatively affected the interest in Trump,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.220]   that he, you know, there's a lot of media coverage
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.940]   about J.D. Vance being potentially the wrong pick
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.860]   for vice president
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.620]   and that he's creating more of a challenge
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.980]   for the president's campaign than a boom?
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.060]   - No, listen, anyone who Trump chose
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.980]   was gonna be absolutely smeared by the other side
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.340]   and by the media.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.260]   If it had been Doug Burgum,
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.460]   there would have been nonstop coverage
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.860]   of the six week abortion bill that he signed.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.700]   - Right.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.540]   - You could go down the list.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.820]   I mean, look, what Democrats will say
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.420]   is we just wanna see a moderate Republican,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.800]   but when Mitt Romney ran, they were calling him a fascist.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.300]   So the reality is that the mainstream media and the DNC,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.780]   but I repeat myself, are gonna smear anyone who's picked.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.820]   At the end of the day, I don't think that it matters.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.940]   What matters is the top of the ticket.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.140]   - Jamal, what do you think about the Harris campaign,
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.900]   how it's going and the momentum
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.820]   that is being projected in the media
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.940]   and the polling data is clearly demonstrating
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.420]   an improvement over Biden's standings in the polls?
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.060]   - I mean, I think we had a situation
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.020]   where one candidate was not real.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.100]   And so Sachs is right that a lot of the polling
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.100]   up until basically last week is not really reliable.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.980]   Now you have this snapback effect,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.300]   which is more about a lot of people
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.100]   that were coming around to this idea of voting for Trump
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   because Biden was such a bad option, now flip-flopping.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.920]   And so I think that's what explains the snapback.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.580]   But Sachs is right, 100 days is a really long time.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.460]   And what Nate Silver's poll essentially shows
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.220]   is if she wants to win, not the popular vote,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.940]   because at this point now, three or four elections in a row,
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.180]   that just doesn't matter anymore.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.980]   If you wanna win the electoral college and be the president,
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.860]   you gotta go and win five states.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.180]   And in order to do that, you have to be very precise
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.220]   on about four or five specific issues.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.820]   And in the absence of her defining herself
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.900]   on those four or five issues, she's not gonna win.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.220]   She'll win the popular vote.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.620]   But again, when people win the popular vote
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.800]   and lose the electoral college,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.380]   we've now gone through that enough times
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.700]   where that's just a fait accompli
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.400]   inside of American electoral politics.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.740]   So I think that the Trump campaign
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.140]   and the Harris campaign need to agree
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.740]   on some schedule of debates.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.900]   I hope that they do two, and ideally three,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.500]   and that they both get after it in front of each other
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.700]   so that those five states
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.540]   that are really going to decide this election
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.140]   has an opportunity to make a decision
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.340]   on behalf of the rest of the country.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.660]   - Yeah, Nick, if you pull that chart back up again,
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.140]   based on Nate Silver's model of polls,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.940]   where he takes all the polling data
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.460]   that's been collected by different third parties,
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.740]   he weights them based on the performance of those polls
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.940]   in terms of predictive power historically,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.580]   and he creates this kind of macro model.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.700]   That's the Nate Silver approach here.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.900]   He's estimating that within the 80% bound,
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.460]   every state on this list is up for grabs,
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.340]   as you can see with the gray lines shown there.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.860]   There's a very slight margin on the average
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.980]   in Wisconsin for Trump,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.260]   in Michigan for Harris, in Pennsylvania for Trump,
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.540]   in Nevada for Trump, in North Carolina for Trump,
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.580]   in Virginia for Harris, and so on.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.360]   But each of those margins is so slim
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.300]   that there's still quite a lot of decision-making
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.580]   ahead for voters.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.900]   So pretty clearly on point
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.340]   that this is still very much an open election.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.420]   I'll give you guys my read.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.540]   I think that there's five camps of voters
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.580]   going into this when Biden was a candidate.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.180]   The first is anti-Biden, anything but Biden.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.340]   The second is anything but Trump.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.780]   The third is pro-Biden.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.820]   The fourth is pro-Trump.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.780]   And then the fifth is the other.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.660]   And I think that that entire bucket of anything but Biden
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.620]   just became available once Biden dropped out of the race.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.580]   And it was a pretty sizable bucket,
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.940]   that there's a large number of voters out there
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.860]   that felt pretty strongly that Biden
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.060]   poses such a significant risk for leadership in this country
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.980]   because of the mental issues
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.220]   and the performance issues that we had seen
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.620]   that as much as people didn't love Trump,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.980]   they were willing to vote for him because he's not Biden.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.620]   Now that camp has an option, and that option is Harris.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.380]   So some percentage of that camp,
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.900]   and I would say probably a super majority of that camp,
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.540]   is now switching into the Harris bucket.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.100]   The pro-Trump bucket doesn't move.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.980]   The pro-Biden bucket probably doesn't move,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.660]   it sticks with Harris.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.780]   And the anything but Trump bucket doesn't move,
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.940]   it sticks with Harris.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.020]   So the fact that there is probably
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.980]   such a sizable number of voters
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.820]   in the anything but Biden camp
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.100]   is what's probably helping Harris at this point
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.140]   and creates a bit of a handicap for Trump
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.140]   going into this last stretch of the campaign.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.100]   That's my real,
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.100]   'cause I know a lot of people with that point of view.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   - That's an interesting point of view,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.660]   and let me just respond to that for a second.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.500]   So one of our critiques of Biden,
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.860]   not just in this election cycle,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.380]   but probably going back a year,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.980]   is that Biden had become basically a figurehead president,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.660]   almost a construct,
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.140]   and he was fronting for a shadow cabinet
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.140]   or a group of powerful staffers
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.700]   who were really running the country,
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.580]   basically because of his cognitive decline.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.260]   And we sort of joke that whoever the White House intern was
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.340]   who was running the social media accounts
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.420]   or the staffer who was running the teleprompter
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.780]   was basically the president
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.500]   because they could dictate what Biden said.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.980]   Now, I think the question to ask is, has anything changed?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.780]   Kamala Harris refuses to do any interviews.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.260]   She doesn't wanna do any unscripted appearances.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.060]   She's abandoned all of her policy positions
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.340]   that have been longstanding
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.980]   and were the reason why she ran for president
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.380]   in the first place in 2020.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.420]   So the question to ask is,
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.100]   do we still have a construct as the president?
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.700]   I mean, the Biden staffers who are running Biden
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.620]   are now just running Harris.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.980]   We don't know what she stands for.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.980]   We don't have her appearing in
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.420]   unscripted natural appearances.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.420]   We don't have her being challenged by the press.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.620]   She's not willing to do what Trump did.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.500]   Trump just walked into the lion's den yet again
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.740]   at the NABJ.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.060]   - National Association of Black Journalists.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.900]   - Right, exactly.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.020]   Trump walks into a very hostile interview at NABJ.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.900]   Harris was supposed to come and she didn't come.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.580]   She would have gotten a very softball interview.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.900]   She's not even willing to do that.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.380]   I think that in substantive terms,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.580]   I don't think that much has changed this election.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.460]   The Biden staff is still running for president.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.860]   I mean, that's what you're voting for.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.980]   - I would disagree on this
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.460]   because I think in the last two weeks,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   what I've seen is statements coming out of the Harris camp
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.980]   that clearly distinguish her and her campaign
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.580]   from Biden's policy positions
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.100]   and Biden's campaign rhetoric historically.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.300]   Most particularly Sachs is on Israel.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.220]   When Netanyahu came to visit the United States,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.020]   she put out a very pro-Israel statement
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.060]   that we all know the Biden camp has largely avoided doing
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.220]   because of the concern
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.460]   over the pro-Palestinian rights movement's reaction
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.340]   to the Biden campaign pro-Israel.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.860]   And the Harris statement was pretty finely worded
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.500]   and pretty strongly worded
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.380]   that she is very much in favor of Israel defending itself.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.060]   She acknowledged that there's a loss of Palestinian life
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.940]   that matters and we need to acknowledge and address it,
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.780]   but she was very much in support of Israel,
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.420]   which is not a position we've seen the Biden camp take.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.500]   And I think that we're starting to see
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.260]   what is a little bit more of a fracturing
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.740]   between Harris being allowed to be free
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.740]   and being allowed to have an opinion
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.140]   outside of the party line dictated by the Biden camp.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.020]   And I think we'll probably see more of that
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.340]   in the next couple of weeks.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.660]   And we'll probably see her starting
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.820]   to be a little bit more refined
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.740]   in what differentiates her from Biden.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.420]   Because I do think that's what's gonna allow her
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.500]   to win this election is she's gonna stand up and say,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.460]   here's why I am not Joe Biden.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.300]   And here's what makes me different from that individual.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.300]   I respect him, I love him, he helped me,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.620]   but let me tell you why I'm different
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.540]   and why that should matter.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.420]   - She snubbed Netanyahu, Freeberg.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.540]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.740]   She snubbed Netanyahu.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.820]   - I think you're an example of the people
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.020]   that want to give her the benefit of the doubt.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.340]   - Okay.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.260]   - I think there's a large fraction of those people.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.100]   - That's not true.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.940]   No, that's not a fair way to characterize me at all.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.140]   I'm simply pointing out that she made a statement.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.580]   I'm pointing out that she made a statement
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.740]   that's different than what Biden said.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.100]   That's it, that's all I'm saying.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.940]   - Hold on a second.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.900]   I think on Israel, so first of all,
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.300]   she didn't write that statement, the staff did, okay?
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.540]   Now, what is the staff trying to accomplish on Israel?
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.660]   They actually have a genuine dilemma
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.420]   on the whole Israel-Palestine issue
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.500]   because the Democrat party is very much split on this.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.460]   The Democrat establishment is pro-Israel,
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.420]   but the progressive base is very pro-Palestine.
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.780]   And even polling among youth
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.380]   shows significant support for Hamas even.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.100]   And a lot of these people are very much
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.940]   within the sort of hardcore left-wing base
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.100]   of the Democrat party.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.620]   So what the Biden administration has been doing
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.020]   and what I think Harris is continuing
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.420]   is a process of talking out of both sides of their mouth.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.980]   Biden went to Israel, bear hug, BB,
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.220]   basically supported his policy,
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.740]   but then gave some lip service to the idea
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.860]   that he would limit the weapons that Israel is able to use.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.500]   Harris puts out this very pro-Israel statement,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.260]   but then snubs Netanyahu
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.580]   at that speech he gave before Congress.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.140]   So look, the Democrats are trying to have it both ways.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.220]   They have a base that is fractured on this issue.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.140]   And so they're trying to thread that needle.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.860]   Now, you're right that, let's just up a level.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.620]   Let's move off the Israel issue for a second.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.140]   There's no question that Harris wants to run from her record
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.100]   as being Biden's vice president.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.660]   There's a good reason for that.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.300]   The Biden-Harris administration is historically unpopular.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   What you have to ask though is whether it's credible.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.020]   Harris suddenly is in favor of more money for border patrol.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.180]   Why didn't she advocate for that
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.780]   when she was Biden's border czar?
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.100]   The media is fiercely scrubbing its websites
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.420]   to remove references.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.900]   Hold on, they're removing historical references
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.820]   from during the Biden administration
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.180]   when she was openly called the border czar.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.660]   They're trying to memory hole that.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   So look, I have no doubt that the Harris campaign
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.060]   wants to drop every substantive policy position
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.260]   she's ever taken
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.860]   because they just want her to be a construct.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.740]   They just want people to be excited because.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.420]   - I do think that what you're saying
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.020]   is exactly what she needs to answer to in public
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.460]   in the next couple of weeks to earn credibility
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.380]   on what is she different from the Biden administration on
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.900]   in terms of policy.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.940]   And why did she not make that clear
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.340]   when she was in the Biden administration?
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.660]   And she can say, "I didn't agree with it."
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.820]   Or she can say, "I've changed my mind."
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.900]   And I think both of those might end up
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.940]   being where she needs to go to.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.660]   But you're right, she does need to answer to that.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.220]   - I don't think it's clear she has to do any of that.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.500]   - You think she can just hide out and coast?
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   - No, right now the calculation is to get as many people
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.820]   to basically move into the not Trump voting stance.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.700]   And they're giving as much time as possible
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.380]   to measure that and see if it's a winning strategy.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.300]   But again, and I think we just talked about this.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.060]   Mathematically, it can win the popular vote
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.860]   but it will not win the electoral college.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.940]   So she is going to have to appear
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.140]   and be in a position where she's confronted
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.220]   on about four or five key issues.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.580]   And that's where this presidency is going to get decided.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.020]   Four or five issues in four or five states
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.860]   and we'll all know where she stands.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.140]   On the border, on the economy.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.220]   By the way, the problem is,
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.980]   and if you look at what's happening now,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.940]   we are in a recessionary stance.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.860]   There's going to be a lot of ink that gets spilled
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.500]   starting in September on the fact that X of a handful
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.940]   of companies were basically in a recession.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.260]   So that's gonna have to get put on the feet
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.220]   of the sitting president and the sitting vice president.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.820]   So there's a whole set of complicated issues.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.820]   I think it's smart actually for her to strategically
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.260]   kind of stay quiet right now and just kind of see
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.420]   all the goodwill that's pent up to the not Trump candidate
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   is going to flow her way.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.060]   The problem is that that's not enough
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.260]   to sustain yourself for a hundred days.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.700]   And so she's just going to have to take a point of view.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.860]   - Well, it might be if the press lets her get away with it.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.020]   - No, because I think, David, I think you're right.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.780]   Because when you go into a debate
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.300]   or when you go into these places,
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.580]   people will want to know the answers to these questions.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.780]   And if the media tries to memory hold this thing,
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.340]   I think the thing that they most don't want,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.020]   which is another Trump victory
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.340]   will actually happen because of it.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.220]   Because people will come in,
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.860]   this kind of like ambivalent group of folks
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.540]   that are or independent group of folks
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.580]   that are looking for very clear point of view
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.660]   on four or five issues, maybe we'll come to a rally.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.260]   And instead of that, they'll hear Megan Thee Stallion
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.540]   and they'll wonder to themselves,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.980]   well, this is not what I came for.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.700]   I came to know where you stand on these four or five issues.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.980]   So if the media actually,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.420]   in order to give her the best chance of getting elected,
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.020]   and this is counterintuitive to them,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.900]   which is why they probably won't do it,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.780]   they'll have to confront her on these issues.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.940]   - Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.860]   And that's why I invite Vice President Harris
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.420]   onto the "All In" podcast to join us for a conversation.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.220]   I think we all really enjoy that.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.460]   And just to declare my position,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.900]   I am in camp five, the other camp.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.860]   I am not pro or anti either of these candidates.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.660]   I obviously have issues that I think are far more existential
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.740]   to the longevity of the United States and the Republic
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.700]   that need to be addressed,
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.820]   that don't seem to be a priority
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.380]   for either candidate or either party.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.780]   As I've mentioned many times on the show,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.540]   that's where I stand.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.380]   Let's move on.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.460]   Sax, I just wanna ask,
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.580]   do you think that Trump is at risk
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.260]   of shooting himself in the foot by being too public,
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.980]   too open and too engaging?
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.620]   If we take a look at what happened this week,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.340]   the National Association of Black Journalists
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.700]   had a convention on Wednesday.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.860]   It sent interview requests to both President Trump
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.940]   and Vice President Harris,
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.740]   and Trump accepted and went in person.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.620]   Harris said she couldn't do it in person or via Zoom.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.620]   And according to the National Association
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.100]   of Black Journalists,
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.140]   Harris is in talks to do a Q&A session with them
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.220]   at some point in September.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.100]   There were two moments that are making a lot of news.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.660]   One was the first question,
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.660]   Nick, can you play this?
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.060]   Where ABC's Rachel Scott went after Trump.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.020]   - A lot of people did not think
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.660]   it was appropriate for you to be here today.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.180]   You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.700]   from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama,
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.100]   saying that they were not born in the United States,
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.460]   which is not true.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.820]   You have told four congresswomen, women of color,
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.100]   who were American citizens,
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.180]   to go back to where they came from.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.740]   You have used words like animal and rabbit
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.300]   to describe black district attorneys.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.580]   You've attacked black journalists,
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.620]   calling them a loser,
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.500]   saying the questions that they ask
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.900]   are, quote, stupid and racist.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.420]   You've had dinner with a white supremacist
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.380]   at your Mar-a-Lago resort.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.180]   So my question, sir,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.900]   now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you,
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.220]   why should black voters trust you
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.380]   after you have used language like that?
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.220]   - Well, first of all,
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.020]   I don't think I've ever been asked a question
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.900]   so, in such a horrible manner,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.740]   a first question.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.700]   You don't even say, hello, how are you?
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.780]   Are you with ABC?
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.020]   Because I think they're a fake news network,
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.860]   a terrible network.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.180]   And I think it's disgraceful that I came here
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.340]   in good spirit.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.660]   I love the black population of this country.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.980]   I've done so much for the black population of this country,
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.460]   including employment,
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.980]   including Opportunity Zones
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.740]   with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.900]   which is one of the greatest programs ever
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.740]   for black workers and black entrepreneurs.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.940]   I've done so much.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.460]   And you know, when I say this,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.340]   historically black colleges and universities
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.300]   were out of money.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.020]   They were stone cold broke.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.980]   And I saved them and I gave them long-term financing
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.620]   and nobody else was doing it.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.180]   I think it's a very rude introduction.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.740]   I don't know exactly why you would do something like that.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.620]   And let me go a step further.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.300]   I was invited here and I was told my opponent,
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.100]   whether it was Biden or Kamala,
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.140]   I was told my opponent was going to be here.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.220]   It turned out my opponent isn't here.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.500]   You invited me under false pretense.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.380]   And then you said, you can't do it with Zoom.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.540]   Well, you know, where's Zoom?
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.100]   She's gonna do it with Zoom and she's not coming.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.420]   And then you were a half an hour late,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.660]   just so we understand.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.660]   I have too much respect for you to be late.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.220]   They couldn't get their equipment working
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.060]   or something was wrong.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.900]   - Mr. President, I would love-
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.580]   - I think it's a very nasty question.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.420]   I have answered the question.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.020]   - Zacks, is he shooting himself in the foot
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.900]   by agreeing to show up?
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.300]   He showed up to the Bitcoin conference,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.260]   which obviously went phenomenally well.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.020]   But Zacks, is he shooting himself in the foot
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.460]   by being too open and engaging too much?
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.020]   And should he lay low?
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.620]   - No, I mean, look, what kind of president do you want?
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.860]   I mean, I want the president who is fearless
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.540]   and willing to walk into the lion's den
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.940]   over and over again and answer tough questions.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.620]   What you saw in that soundbite here
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.300]   is that Rachel Scott, the interviewer,
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.700]   that whatever she was doing is not journalism.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.660]   This is supposed to be a journalism association.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.460]   She turned that interview into an ambush.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.260]   It was hostile, what she did, and right out of the gate.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.180]   I mean, the first question, she's attacking him,
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.580]   and he pushed back on it.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.300]   I mean, I think you saw him push back on the media
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.540]   in a way that only Trump can do.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.660]   Now, you also heard there, I think, a really key point,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.340]   that Harris basically passed on the opportunity to attend
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.660]   when she was originally supposed to.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.300]   That would have been a softball interview for her,
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.940]   but she is not willing to do
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.540]   any kind of interview right now.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.180]   No questions, no unscripted appearances.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.660]   She just wants to read from a teleprompter.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.500]   That rally she did in Atlanta
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.660]   that had Megan Thee Stallion perform,
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.260]   so it was a free concert,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.980]   that drew out a huge number of people.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.700]   Then Harris spoke for 17 minutes,
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.060]   and people were leaving five minutes in
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.860]   because they were just there for the concert.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.020]   I guess the question that people need to ask,
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.060]   I understand why this is strategic for her.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.140]   I mean, obviously, it's better for you
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.780]   if you don't have to take any positions whatsoever,
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.420]   and you can just abandon all of your previous positions
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.180]   without any explanation whatsoever,
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.900]   and the media gives you a free pass on that.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.020]   I can understand why that's strategic,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.500]   but I think that voters need to ask the question,
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.260]   who do you want representing the United States right now
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.740]   in a world that's on fire?
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.020]   Who do you want to stand up to Putin or Xi
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.380]   or make peace with them?
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.580]   Who do you want to stand up to
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.780]   or be allies with Netanyahu, for example?
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.580]   The United States right now is in a very difficult situation.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.260]   We can't have a teleprompter president.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.060]   We need a strong president.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.660]   I appreciate the fact that Trump
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.820]   is willing to take on all challengers.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.180]   I just think it's manifestly clear
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   that these are the qualities and traits
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.460]   you want in a president of the United States.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.620]   - Okay, so your opinion is Trump needs to continue
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.380]   to engage openly and publicly.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.500]   It shows strength, and it shows a capacity
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.940]   to deal with adversity and conflict.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.780]   Point taken.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.300]   So let's pull up the next clip
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.580]   where Scott then asked Trump if Harris was a DEI candidate,
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.900]   and here's his answer.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.140]   - I've known her a long time indirectly,
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.100]   not directly very much,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.620]   and she was always of Indian heritage,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.580]   and she was only promoting Indian heritage.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.660]   I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.340]   when she happened to turn black,
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.420]   and now she wants to be known as black.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.700]   So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.260]   - She is always identified as a black
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.060]   when she went to a historically black college.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.980]   - I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.780]   because she was Indian all the way,
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.580]   and then all of a sudden she made a turn,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.180]   and she went, she became a black person.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.020]   - Just to be clear, sir,
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.860]   do you believe that she's- - And I think,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.740]   I think somebody should look into that too
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.740]   when you ask, continue in a very hostile, nasty tone.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.620]   - Timoth, let me ask for your response.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.060]   Did Trump shoot himself in the foot with that comment?
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.500]   And maybe you can give us your read on how he's doing
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.660]   with respect to this, you know, active engagement
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.420]   with obviously adverse, let's call them, you know,
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.420]   journalists and interviews and forums.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.580]   - Well, I'd love to hear from the Caucasians.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.940]   What do you guys think about that?
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.260]   Yeah, I'm not talking about the answer itself.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.060]   I'm talking more about Trump getting out there
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.540]   and like engaging in this way.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.660]   - Yeah, here's what I will say.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.460]   I think that from now until the end of time
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:19.260]   with social media tools replacing traditional media,
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:27.180]   and then with AI tools that are going to create
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.740]   enormous amounts of very sophisticated misinformation
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.980]   and disinformation, I think the only strategy
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.140]   for politicians from here on out is to leave zero ambiguity
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   between what you think and what you say.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:46.180]   And so without judging the quality of the answer,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.660]   I think the thing that is going to be the most critical
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.540]   for people is to know that the person
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.580]   that you're voting for is in charge.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.220]   And you get a great chance to vote this person up or down.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.300]   And the more content that that person puts out directly,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.860]   the less likely it is that this ambiguity exists
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.100]   that can then get exploited,
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.540]   whether it's by internal people inside of a country
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.940]   or whether it's foreign adversaries.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:15.940]   And so my perspective is it's pretty fearless of somebody
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.300]   to just constantly say what they think.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.700]   And again, I'll just go back to what I said before
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.500]   with respect to the Harris campaign.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.380]   I think that Americans were smart enough,
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.500]   and I think you did a good job
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.700]   of dissecting the electorate into five groups.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.780]   Americans were smart enough to basically say never Biden
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.260]   because of the risk it represented
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.020]   to not know what one was voting for,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.540]   irrespective of whatever your historic allegiances were.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.020]   I think they're smart enough now to demand answers
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.060]   to the four or five questions that really matter.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.140]   And I think if Harris wants to really win this
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.380]   and give it a legitimate shot,
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.060]   she's gonna have to take a point of view
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.580]   on these five things.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.980]   And she's gonna have to step into the lion's den
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.420]   and be asked very tough questions
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.740]   by a lot of different people.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.900]   And she's going to have to leave no ambiguity
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.660]   that can be then exploited by misinformation
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.980]   and disinformation between now and the election.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.180]   So that's honestly my reaction.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.820]   Zach, final word?
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.660]   - Yeah, look, I would say that in that clip
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.980]   and other clips from that event,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.220]   I think you should pay a lot of attention
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.940]   to the audience's reaction
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.780]   because what do they do in that moment
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.300]   when Trump was supposedly committing a faux pas
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.740]   or getting into dangerous territory?
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.580]   They laughed.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.740]   You know, when Mitt Romney spoke to this group
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.420]   a number of years ago when he was running for president,
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.620]   he got booed.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.580]   Trump never got booed.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.620]   He got a lot of laughter.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.860]   There was a lot of appreciation.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.700]   Why?
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.740]   'Cause Trump is always authentic.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.220]   He's always who he is.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.140]   Whereas Mitt Romney always appears to be scripted
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.460]   and frankly sort of patronizing.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.820]   So I think the audience appreciated Trump for who he is.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.180]   I think that when Trump goes into these areas,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.260]   there's always a grain of truth to what he's saying.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.660]   I think that Harris has leaned into different parts
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.340]   of her heritage for different audiences.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.860]   But I do think that this is ground he should get off of.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.620]   And I think a much better line of attack
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.660]   is to talk about the fact that she has dropped
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.900]   all of her left-wing policy positions
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.940]   and refuses to answer questions
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.580]   or do unscripted appearances
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.220]   without having a teleprompter in front of her.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.900]   I think that's a much better line of attack.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.100]   - Well, I do agree.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.100]   - And I think that's what the campaign
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.420]   will be about from here.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.460]   You know, I don't think we want this campaign
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.620]   to be about identity.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.620]   - I do think that the rise of the authentic politician,
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.740]   the rise of the authentic CEO/typically founder,
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.900]   the rise of the authentic celebrity
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.580]   is definitely the trend that we're seeing,
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.940]   which is that authenticity counts for more than anything,
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.220]   regardless of one's position.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:54.220]   And, you know, obviously having trust in the individual
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.300]   is rooted in the authentic capacity of the individual
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.060]   rather than the teleprompter CEO
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.140]   or the teleprompter politician
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.020]   or the teleprompter or buttoned-up
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.820]   or image-managed celebrity.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.420]   And that's definitely been a trend
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.620]   that's been building over the last 10 years,
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.260]   culminating in a lot of these changes
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.460]   that we're now seeing. - Totally.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.380]   I mean, look, just think about what's gonna happen
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.340]   over the next four years if Harris is elected.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.380]   I mean, you're gonna have a prompter president.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.700]   I mean, she's just never gonna be off-prompter.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.860]   It's gonna be, like, Biden at least tried to go off-prompter.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.940]   Whenever he did, it was a disaster,
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.100]   but at least he tried. - By the way, I mean,
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.460]   this is one of the criticisms of a lot of hired
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.780]   large enterprise CEOs is that they come in,
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.060]   they have all their words written for them by a media team.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.700]   They have all of their communications scripted, managed.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.020]   Every press interview is with the right journalist
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.620]   said in the right way.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.980]   And the CEOs that seem to build the greatest value
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.140]   are those who are typically founders
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.300]   because they're willing and able to be authentic
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.020]   because they weren't hired by the board.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.740]   It's their business that they built.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.060]   And so they're willing to be authentic.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.180]   And the CEOs who operate at scale with authenticity
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.460]   build the greatest market value.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.580]   - I agree with you that whether you're a CEO
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.500]   or you're a politician, authenticity counts.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.420]   But I think this election's gonna be a test
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.660]   of what people want in their president.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.820]   I mean, do you think the president
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.420]   needs to be a chief executive
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.620]   who at some level is calling the shots,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.380]   or do you think it's good enough for the presidency
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.140]   to essentially be a construct
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.180]   and to be a manifestation of the staff, right?
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.260]   - I think voters look at policy sacks
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.900]   and they look at character.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.620]   And with respect to character,
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.500]   there's a certain value that they ascribe
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.460]   to this authenticity component,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.020]   which is typically lacking in most politicians.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.940]   And Trump delivers that authentic component
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.140]   in how he talks and how he's off the cuff and so on.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.580]   He's got other character issues, which I think hurt him.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.900]   And on the policy side,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.540]   people really kind of look at those objectively,
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.460]   those points, what's your policy?
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   And do I trust you as your character?
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.380]   - Right, but see, I think it's more than that,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.980]   because I think any large organization
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.500]   needs a chief executive.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.620]   What happens when you don't have a chief executive
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.620]   or you don't have a strong chief executive?
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.860]   You get drift.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.820]   The organization strategically drifts.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.660]   - 100%, yeah, it gets driven from the bottom
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.500]   instead of from the top.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.700]   - Yeah, the decisions that get made
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.180]   are the result of bureaucracy
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.820]   and political infighting and staffers, exactly.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.820]   You need someone to control that.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.340]   And I think it's really interesting
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.820]   that when Biden was still the candidate,
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.380]   but everyone could tell that he was sort of impaired,
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.060]   that the arguments you started hearing
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.740]   from Democrat partisans and the media
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.060]   is that, well, you're voting for a team.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.580]   You're not just voting for a president, right?
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.060]   You're voting for a shadow cabinet.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.340]   Exactly the thing that we criticized
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.820]   on this pod for the last year.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.500]   My point is that you're still voting for a shadow cabinet.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.340]   Unless Harris is willing to get out there
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.900]   and answer questions and be unscripted,
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.100]   you're just voting for a staff.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.780]   And I don't think that's good enough.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.260]   When we're in a world where we're in a proxy war with Russia
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.620]   and we could be in a war with China
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.460]   and we have these problems in the Middle East,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.580]   I want a decider.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.420]   I want to know that the buck stops here,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.540]   not the buck stops wherever.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.380]   - Let's shift topics.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.820]   I'd like to talk about what's been,
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.820]   I think, a lot of chatter amongst friends of ours
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.980]   who are active in the market
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.980]   that at a policy meeting on Wednesday,
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.460]   the Fed held rates steady.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.020]   Jerome Powell said, quote,
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.660]   "A reduction in our policy rate could be on the table
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.300]   "in September if inflation continues to fall."
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.940]   He said, "We're getting closer to the point
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.220]   "at which it'll be appropriate to reduce our policy rate,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.380]   "but we're not quite at that point."
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.460]   The next Fed meeting where this rate cut could happen
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.300]   is September 17th and 18th.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.220]   And if you look at the futures markets today,
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.140]   the market is now estimating a 20% probability
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.900]   of a 50-bit rate cut in the September meeting,
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.900]   80% probability of a 25-bit rate cut
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.380]   and basically no probability of no rate cut
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.300]   anymore in September.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   Chamath, is that your read on where we're at?
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   And is the Fed appropriately reading the economic tea leaves
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.180]   given the recessionary indicators
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.740]   that you just mentioned earlier?
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.660]   And what else we're seeing that the Fed's mandate,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.260]   obviously, is meant to support both the monetary policy,
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.380]   but also employment in this country?
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.860]   - I think we're in a recession.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.660]   And I think the problem with a recession
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.900]   is even as inflation diminishes,
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   if your purchasing power is shrinking faster
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.540]   and prices fall, it still feels like prices are going up.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.540]   I don't know if you guys have been reading
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.660]   the Wall Street Journal, but the last couple of days,
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.740]   they've been doing a whole series on people
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.740]   that have been left behind by inflation.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:48.340]   And I was really surprised as I read those articles,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.900]   just the sheer quantity of impact
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.300]   in terms of the number of people
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.580]   it's touching independent of salary.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.380]   And so my takeaway kind of just reinforced the fact
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.500]   that we've sort of looked past the problem
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.420]   because of the stock market going up
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:11.380]   for the last few quarters because of seven companies.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.700]   And now that people are sobering up to the reality
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.660]   that even they don't have an answer
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.420]   for all the money they're spending,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.820]   the stock market's down next to those seven businesses.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.300]   And I think that you're gonna start
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.980]   to see some real pain in the fall.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.620]   So Jerome Powell is probably gonna cut 25.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.180]   And I think that if they get to him, he'll try to cut 50.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.220]   But the problem is it won't solve the problem.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.580]   And I think if this is again, where Kamala Harris has to be,
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.180]   she's gonna have to make a very difficult calculation here,
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.980]   which is she's going to have to throw Joe Biden
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.180]   and the economic team in the White House under the bus here
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.580]   and say, that was them.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.620]   Yes, they screwed it up.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.300]   It was against my wishes.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.020]   And here's my vision for how we fix this
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.100]   because otherwise the Republicans will be all over it.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.940]   And I think if you have a bad economy,
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.780]   like what it looks like going into November,
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.820]   it's gonna be very difficult for the Democrats
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.340]   to win the White House.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.820]   - Well, without bringing it back to politics,
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   Sachs, economy, good or bad?
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.540]   And is Jerome Powell gonna cut rates 25 bips, 50 bips?
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.300]   Do you agree with what the market's forecasting?
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.060]   - I guess what I would say about the economy
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   is that in nominal terms, we're not in a recession
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.220]   according to the data that's come out.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.060]   The Q2 GDP was roughly 2% GDP growth.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.900]   However, I think there's a couple of problems.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.020]   One is that what we've seen over the past year or so
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.300]   is that the economic data that comes out
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.500]   keeps getting re-forecast down.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.660]   So they put out a provisional number or an estimate,
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.900]   and then when they finalize the number
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.940]   three months or six months later,
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.500]   it always seems to go in one direction.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.060]   We've seen this over and over again
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.060]   with new jobs being re-forecast down.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.660]   And we saw this with the Q1 GDP
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.420]   where initially they were reporting,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.100]   I think it was like a 1.8% number,
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.740]   and then it got restated down to 1.3%.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.580]   So the Q2 GDP number was around 2%, it was good,
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.860]   but again, it's a provisional number,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.420]   and let's see where it actually ends up.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.500]   The bigger problem is government spending.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   The deficit is running at 6% of GDP,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.860]   whereas economic growth is at,
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.700]   let's call it charitably 2%.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.560]   Well, government spending is included in GDP.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.460]   So if you were to balance the budget,
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.460]   let's say that you were to make government
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.700]   live within its means and not have a deficit,
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.500]   we'd have negative 4% GDP growth.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.020]   So the only reason why we're in positive
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.540]   GDP growth territory is because of
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.780]   massive government spending
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.760]   that we know is not sustainable.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.320]   And at some point, the bill is gonna come due for that.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.200]   So I'd have to say that,
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.000]   you asked me, is this a good economy?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.620]   I mean, it's not the worst,
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.540]   but there's definitely unsustainable things propping it up.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.500]   And I do think that the bill will come due
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.340]   at some point for this.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.900]   - It's not just fully supported,
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.020]   it's overly supported by the federal government
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.860]   in the United States.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.940]   And I mentioned this last week,
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.020]   federal government spending is over 2x
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.100]   the sum of all state spending.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.140]   Federal government spending into the next year
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.940]   with the Biden budget proposal, $7.3 trillion.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.580]   That's like 30% of GDP.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.580]   And I think you guys may remember this analysis
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.580]   I pulled together a couple months ago,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.580]   where I estimate something close to 30% of US employment
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.700]   is either direct government employment
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.380]   or indirect government employment
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.100]   through government payments to third parties
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.840]   that are employing those individuals.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.500]   So the government is becoming an integral part
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.580]   of maintaining the flow of dollars in the economy
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.100]   because they are such an integral buyer and seller
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.900]   within the economy and an integral employer
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.020]   within the economy.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.380]   And so to reverse that trend is what I worry about
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.580]   more than anything, as I've shared many times,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.060]   which is why I question whether either political candidate
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.540]   actually solves this problem for us.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.020]   And we're almost like, you know,
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.540]   arguing over which marbles I get
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.540]   while the Titanic is sinking,
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.500]   that there is a real fundamental issue
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.260]   with how this economy is structured.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.420]   I will tell you anecdotally,
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.020]   I have a lot of conversations with folks
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.380]   that work in the agriculture industry,
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.060]   in the food industry, in the industrial industry,
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.660]   many of these industries
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.020]   that have a very different capital flow cycle
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.140]   than we all deal with typically
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.860]   in Silicon Valley and software.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.340]   And many of them are struggling.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   I mean, these are businesses where some folks have told me
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.500]   orders completely fell off a cliff in capital equipment,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.260]   that some small business owners
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.860]   that sell whatever piece of equipment
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.740]   you wanna come up with, they are not getting orders.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.380]   There's no revenue.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.940]   There are massive oversupply and underpurchasing happening
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.380]   in the food and ag markets.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.700]   And yet folks are still trying to push up prices
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.180]   in order to make the debt payments
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.380]   that they have to make on their high interest debt now.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.620]   And that creates a crippling condition for them.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.820]   Across the economy, I think there's the haves
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.740]   and the have-nots as is indicated in this article
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.940]   that was just pulled up,
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.460]   where there are some parts of the economy
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.660]   where you have low debt, high margin businesses
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.340]   that can continue to scale and continue to raise pricing,
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.900]   have a lot of elasticity in pricing.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.620]   And then there are the others that operate
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.700]   on 1% interest rate charges,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.260]   the changes drive their profit or loss for the year
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.580]   in a pretty meaningful way.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.260]   And that's the part of the economy that's really suffering.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.140]   And unfortunately, the action that will be taken
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.020]   to resolve this isn't necessarily a free market action.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.300]   It's gonna end up being some sort
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.580]   of government intervention,
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.260]   which furthers the government's involvement in the economy
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.700]   and furthers the tentacles that make it much harder
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.300]   to ultimately pull out of this spiral in this problem.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.820]   That's my rant on this whole point, but.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.300]   - Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.140]   I agree with all that.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.420]   I've seen some reports that a crazy percentage
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.860]   of the job creation over the past year
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.900]   has been government jobs.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.540]   - All of it, more than 100%.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.060]   So basically there has been a net loss
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.420]   in private market jobs,
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.820]   net of the effect of government employment
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.340]   or government spending on companies
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.340]   that then use those dollars to go hire people.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.860]   Let's talk about the impact on markets.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.420]   So, as a result of this rate cut announcement
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.300]   or this rate cut indication,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.060]   markets have rallied a little bit,
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.140]   but to Chamath's point, there are definitely
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.940]   the haves and the have nots.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.380]   AMD beat.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.900]   They were up 4% after hours on improved AI chip sales.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.620]   Their revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year over year.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.780]   Microsoft had so-so results.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.700]   NVIDIA jumped 12% on some comments made by Meta
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.140]   and Microsoft that both said
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.740]   that there's increased AI demand
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.300]   and they're gonna continue to build that capacity.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.100]   So Chamath, I know you've talked a lot about this
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:38.940]   in the past.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.220]   Maybe you can give us your read
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.660]   on the comments that were made this week.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.460]   You've historically said that a lot of this build-out
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.980]   is well ahead and there's no real ROI yet,
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.700]   but clearly some of the buyers of this capital equipment
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.180]   are saying, "Hey, there is ROI.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.540]   We're gonna continue to build aggressively."
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.820]   So maybe you can share a little bit on,
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.980]   is anything different or are we just kind of
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.700]   seeing folks justify the decision statement?
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.580]   - I mean, sadly, this is another case of sell the news.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:07.140]   These things rallied phantom in the after hours
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:07.980]   and if you look at them,
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.620]   they've all just given back every dollar of gains.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:16.140]   So I think that people know that we're sort of
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.740]   at the tail end of the hype cycle in AI.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.180]   And every chance, every time these things spike,
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.580]   people take an opportunity to just massively sell.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.140]   I mean, Nvidia's turned over 308 million shares today.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.980]   - Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.020]   It's literally-- - We're just at the beginning
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.860]   of the day.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.180]   - It's trading like a penny stock.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.700]   - It's going straight down like a lead balloon.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.540]   - Yeah.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.820]   - Meta rallied, they've basically given up
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.660]   all of their gains.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.220]   It's gone kind of straight down today.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.700]   But the point isn't that these companies are going to zero.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.020]   That's not the case.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.580]   It's just the point is that right now,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.300]   people are optimizing, they're selling every chance they get
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.820]   to kind of book the profits.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.180]   And I think that that's fair because at some point,
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.940]   nobody knows when all of this phantom money
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.420]   is gonna show up.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.700]   - Right, so this is independent of what we would call
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.940]   the economy, independent of the recessionary conversation
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.020]   we just had. - The problem is that,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.260]   look, I mean, I'm in the middle of this right now
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.100]   with 80/90.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.780]   It's been one of the joys of my career
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.540]   to actually start a company in the middle of what I think
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.060]   is the most important wave that I've ever seen professionally
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.860]   since social networking.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.700]   And I jumped into the middle of that wave
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.980]   and I kind of tried to ride the best wave I could there.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.220]   I'm doing it here.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.020]   But my honest takeaway after being in this thing now
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.500]   for seven months intensely, and I'll be into it
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   for as many years as it takes to build a successful company,
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.220]   is that AI is massively deflationary.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.900]   It takes not that much money and the results
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.620]   are really meaningful in terms of the amount of efficiency
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.340]   that you can capture and the costs that you can save.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.140]   And the right business people, i.e. startups
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.340]   that are starting from scratch like myself
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.100]   and my co-founders at 80/90, we will pass that on
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.780]   to our customers because it allows us
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.140]   to differentially price versus incumbent solutions.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.220]   And so I don't see a path where all of a sudden
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.620]   a multiple of the money that's been spent shows up.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.220]   I don't see it.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.580]   I do see a path where companies find tremendous,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.700]   like think about it this way.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.940]   If you looked in the 1980s and said,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.820]   what is the most profitable operational company
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.740]   that existed in the '80s?
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.420]   I don't know what that company was,
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.980]   but I suspect that their EBITDA margins
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.260]   were roughly in the 30 or 40% range
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.460]   and it was probably incredible.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.100]   If you fast forward now 40 years,
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.140]   the most efficient company is probably sort of 50
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.940]   or 60% EBITDA margins.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:56.460]   The reality is that the best AI enabled company
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.980]   will probably have margins that are 70 and 80%
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.300]   in the next 15 or 20 years.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.740]   Now that's an incredible thing.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.820]   - That's a big prediction.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.340]   - But that will again spur the principle law of capitalism
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.700]   that everybody keeps forgetting,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.100]   which is you compete out excess return.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.540]   And so while you will have many companies
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.660]   that have 60 plus percent operating margins,
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.220]   they'll be in much smaller markets
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.660]   and there'll be thousands and thousands and thousands of them.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.700]   So I suspect what happens is that the overall market grows,
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.420]   but the number of companies grows
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.780]   by an even order, larger order of magnitude.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.940]   And in all of that,
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.660]   the reality is that it's going to be very hard
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.900]   for these big folks to sort of see this value capture
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.220]   that makes any of this investment worthwhile.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.420]   So I think that you're going to have to have
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.860]   some sort of reset in terms of the CAPEX
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.820]   that's happened here.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.020]   - I want to switch gears yet again
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.980]   and talk about the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.420]   I hope I pronounced that right, Haniyeh.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.580]   He was killed by a bomb
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.420]   while staying in a guest house in Tehran,
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.020]   according to the New York Times.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.940]   Earlier reports indicated that he was in fact killed
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.180]   by a missile strike from Israel.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.420]   But just this morning, the New York Times reported
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.020]   that the guest house where he stayed
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.460]   is run and protected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.500]   and is part of a large compound known as Neshat
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.820]   in an upscale neighborhood of Northern Tehran.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.380]   And the article in the New York Times goes on to report
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.740]   that according to several Middle Eastern sources,
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.700]   a bomb, a remotely detonated bomb,
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.780]   was actually planted in this guest house
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   over two months ago in anticipation
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.700]   of the Hamas leader's stay in this guest house.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.860]   And it was then set off
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.060]   once he actually stayed in the guest house.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.700]   This obviously represents kind of an incredible feat
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.620]   in operational capacity and intelligence.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.740]   I think we've known and talked a lot about,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.580]   and the media has kind of covered quite a bit
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.780]   about the capacity of Mossad.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.420]   But I just want to kind of get your guys' reaction to this.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.140]   I think that there's a bigger and important story here
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.140]   about the strength of Israel's intelligence
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.340]   and military capacity in the region
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.380]   and what that could mean for their posturing
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.940]   and their demands and their activity in the region
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.900]   in the months and years ahead,
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.980]   particularly with Netanyahu still in charge.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.820]   So Sax, maybe you can kick us off
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.660]   with your thoughts on this article
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.300]   and Mossad's role in the assassination of this Hamas leader.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.380]   - Well, there's no question that the Mossad
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.700]   established or reestablished its reputation
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.540]   for extreme competence here.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.660]   Being able to infiltrate Iran
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.620]   in order to assassinate the top political leader of Hamas
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.420]   while Haniyeh was a guest of Iran,
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.580]   I mean, that's deeply humiliating to Iran.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.300]   I think he was there, Haniyeh was,
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:49.220]   for the swearing in of the new president of Iran.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.860]   So for them to be able to target him
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.220]   while he was there and set up the bomb months in advance,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.860]   I mean, that shows extraordinary planning and intelligence
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.300]   and a huge failure on the part of Iran.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   I think in terms of the larger significance of this,
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.380]   you know, in the wake of October 7th on this pod,
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.380]   I said that I hope that Israel did not go off half-cocked,
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.420]   responding the way that the United States did after 9/11.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.940]   And when they started bombing Gaza,
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.060]   I said this is gonna backfire.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.940]   And, you know, boy, was that an understatement
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.940]   in terms of the reaction of world opinion.
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   I mean, Israel went into Gaza, basically leveled the place,
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.380]   and has alienated practically the entire world.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.460]   The only country that's solidly with Israel anymore
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.540]   is the United States.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.180]   And even within the United States,
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.420]   roughly half the people are now against Israel.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.060]   And I think what I said at the time
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.020]   was that Israel could pursue or should pursue
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.180]   a more targeted strategy the way that it did
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.060]   after the Munich Olympics.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.940]   This assassination within Iran
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.820]   shows that the Munich Olympics strategy,
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.860]   I mean, they've basically shown that it's successful.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.420]   They've been able to do it.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.620]   I wish they had limited their response
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.380]   in this more targeted way,
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.780]   because I think that the destruction of Gaza
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.300]   has created tremendous humanitarian suffering,
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.860]   and it's alienated just about the whole world.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.100]   And what has it accomplished?
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.740]   I don't think they've gotten rid of Hamas.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.460]   They have not been able to kill
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.340]   the military leader of Hamas, which is Sanwar,
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.740]   who was the actual military planner
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.060]   of the October 7th attack.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.580]   And they have radicalized.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.060]   Whatever part of the Palestinian population
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.660]   was not radicalized has been radicalized.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.980]   And they've turned so much of the Middle East
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.660]   and the world against them in such a strong way
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.780]   that, again, I wish that they had pursued
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.980]   the more measured strategy.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.100]   It's still a tough strategy.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:45.940]   I mean--
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.940]   - Let me put you in Netanyahu's seat.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.820]   You are leading Israel.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.820]   Hamas comes into your country, attacks,
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.500]   kills lots of people.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.460]   What is your measured response to that attack from Hamas,
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.780]   given the capacity you have?
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.860]   The Israeli Air Force, by the way,
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.340]   is second only to the United States.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.220]   Just to give you some statistics,
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.020]   the Israeli Air Force has 90,000 active
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.020]   and reserve personnel and 614 aircraft.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.100]   Israel is reported to have up to 400 nuclear weapons.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.540]   And they have this extraordinary technical capacity
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.100]   with Mossad and operational capacity
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.660]   that is kind of unrivaled pretty much
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.300]   anywhere in the world, it seems.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.340]   What do you do if you're sitting in Netanyahu's seat
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.860]   that provides a more kind of measured response?
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.740]   And how do you kind of lead your nation?
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.380]   - Well, first of all, I'm not, obviously,
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.220]   sitting in that seat.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.820]   I don't live in Israel and I don't have skin
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.860]   in the game that way.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.820]   So I think the first thing that they would say is,
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.980]   you're not us, you're not sitting here
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.820]   dealing with all of our enemies in the region.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.580]   And they would have a point.
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.740]   But what I advocated, I think, months ago
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.140]   was to take a more targeted, measured strategy
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.780]   that I think the assassination of Haniyeh
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.260]   shows that they could have executed.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.620]   And I understand why they went into Gaza
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.420]   and why they felt they needed to go into Gaza.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.820]   But I just, this is not an anti-Israel statement.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.340]   It's just a questioning of the strategy.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.300]   I just don't see that it's produced much good.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.780]   I don't think they've solved their Hamas problem.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.580]   They have not gotten Sinwar.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.460]   And they've lost a meaningful amount of global support.
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.180]   - Yeah, Chamath, do you have a read?
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.540]   - I think that it was, in hindsight,
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.140]   a pretty big miscalculation by Netanyahu
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.580]   to pursue the strategy that they did.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.180]   And I would have much preferred what you're seeing now,
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.100]   which is a very targeted approach.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.980]   I think it preserves, and it would have preserved,
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.140]   not just world political support,
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.660]   but just individual people's support,
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.580]   where instead of going into Gaza, leveling the place,
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.460]   creating all of this death and destruction,
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.460]   and amplifying and confusing people
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:52:00.380]   where they now all of a sudden had to make a decision
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.540]   between these two groups
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.700]   and now get confused with anti-Semitic sentiment.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.340]   That should never have happened.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:11.380]   It's clear that Mossad is incredibly competent
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.180]   and incredibly capable.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.980]   I do believe that sovereign countries
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.500]   have the right to defend themselves.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.020]   But then there was a bridge too far,
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.580]   and I think the Israeli government has crossed it.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:30.140]   In hindsight, and I think I told you this story,
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.100]   and I may have relayed this in confidence,
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.100]   but I'll just say it again.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:36.940]   On October the 8th, what was offered,
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.860]   and I'm not gonna say by who,
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:43.860]   was sort of a meeting of the right political leadership
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:48.540]   from the Middle East, Israel, and the United States,
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.220]   where they were all willing to sort of come,
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.180]   and the idea would have been to extend
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.860]   some sort of structured solution
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.060]   for the Palestinian people.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.700]   Now, that would have been so unintuitive and unexpected.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.900]   I think everybody would have been
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.980]   a little bit on their heels,
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.340]   but I think what it would have done
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:12.780]   is it would have passed Netanyahu in an incredible light.
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.500]   It would have passed Israel in an incredible light.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.220]   They would have still preserved the ability
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.380]   to go and kill the individual leaders that they wanted to,
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.140]   but it was rejected.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.580]   And I think that when we look back,
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.940]   these are the kinds of decisions
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.860]   that hopefully history documents accurately
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.380]   so that folks who are in the seat, to your point, Freeberg,
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.020]   the next time around can make a different calculation.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.820]   I see, you see the pictures,
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.660]   and there's just no way that you can turn them off.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.900]   - I think Israel's biggest asset
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.500]   is probably also their biggest liability,
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.540]   which is their military and intelligence strength.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.860]   And it emboldens them in a way
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.400]   that they can be more aggressive
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.620]   than perhaps they need to be
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.380]   with respect to maintaining the security of the state,
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.700]   but perhaps being vengeful and vindictive.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.620]   And I know that that's a very controversial statement
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.520]   to be made.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.460]   I wanna underscore the strength
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.180]   of this military and this intelligence.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.740]   Do you guys remember the Stuxnet worm
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.140]   from a number of years ago?
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.900]   - Yeah. - That story was incredible.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.220]   The New York Times broke this story in 2012.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.160]   Stuxnet was a malicious computer worm,
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.300]   and I'm reading off of Wikipedia
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.300]   'cause there's a lot of reporting
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.180]   that has different opinions on this,
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.820]   that was first uncovered in 2010
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.740]   and was thought to have been in development
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.680]   since at least 2005.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.420]   Now, this computer worm was supposedly developed
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.000]   by Mossad and the NSA.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.900]   And it was a malicious computer worm
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.580]   that ultimately allowed intrusion
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.700]   into the control systems of the centrifuges
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.360]   of Iran's uranium refining systems.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.640]   And they basically were then able
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.840]   to make those centrifuges go haywire
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.460]   and destroyed themselves.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.600]   And they did this over and over for several years,
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.180]   and the Iranians could not figure out
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.600]   what was going on or why.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.420]   They kept it completely secret.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.280]   Ultimately, it was revealed that there was this operation
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.460]   organized by the United States
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:06.840]   called Operation Olympic Games
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.780]   that was a cyber disruption operation,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.660]   and that Mossad had a critical role in.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.520]   By the way, there are two other stories
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.060]   that build on top of this
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.100]   that are tangential but related.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.600]   One is that there was a nuclear engineer
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.920]   that Israel felt should be unlid.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.820]   And the way that they did it was via
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.980]   some remote control machine gun
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.960]   that they planted off of a highway
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.900]   where the car egressed off the highway,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.240]   and then all of a sudden, the thing was shot up.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.340]   A different example was there's a story
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.120]   about how they figured out that Yasser Arafat was sick
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.120]   because they were able to collect a stool sample
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.360]   from a pipe that left his home,
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.960]   and they were able to kind of diagnose
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.240]   that A, it was his stool,
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.960]   and then B, he had some chronic illness.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.640]   My point, I think, in all of this
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.280]   is kind of where you're going,
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.200]   which is that when you have such capability
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.000]   and such precision,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.480]   to go to the other end of the spectrum,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.160]   you really have to be sure that you're right.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.720]   And as Zach said, I think we're looking back,
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.600]   and it's clear that the support around the world,
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.960]   it just isn't there for that kind of mass casualty
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.560]   and that kind of like--
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.600]   - If Israel could actually destroy Hamas
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.960]   and achieve its military objective in Gaza,
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.920]   that'd be one thing.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   But I think we've seen that that's impossible.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.560]   I mean, Hamas basically bleeds in with the population.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.280]   It's indistinguishable.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.720]   And the leadership is hidden deep underground,
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.760]   and the Israelis have not been able to root them out
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.720]   against the war, has not been found.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.360]   And so you've destroyed Gaza,
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.640]   but you have not achieved your objective
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.120]   of eliminating Hamas.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.280]   And in the process, you've deeply alienated
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.360]   most of the world, and you made the situation worse,
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.200]   basically.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.280]   - It's like the Russians and the Americans
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.160]   trying to chase the Taliban in Afghanistan forever.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.920]   This is not a group of individuals
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.440]   that once they're gone,
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.400]   everything is fixed.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.520]   - Everything's just worse.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.160]   I mean, you still have the same problem.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.360]   In fact, now the entire Palestinian population
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.200]   is radicalized.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.640]   In fact, the whole Arab and Muslim population
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:12.040]   in the Middle East is more radicalized against you
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.120]   than they were before.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.080]   I mean, I know there was already
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.280]   a significant amount of hatred,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.640]   but now it's worse.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.080]   And you haven't fundamentally solved the underlying issue.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.560]   I think the 9/11 analogy is apt.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.920]   I mean, we went off after 9/11,
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.520]   half cocked into all these wars in the Middle East.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.920]   I think that going into Afghanistan,
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.600]   I think you could, that was justified
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.080]   because they were harboring al-Qaeda.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   But then we went into Iraq
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.640]   because really members of the Bush administration
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.960]   had a pre-existing agenda,
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.440]   and then they lied us into it,
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.360]   saying that Saddam was connected somehow to 9/11.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.920]   And we began a 20-year process
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.840]   of just plunging ourselves into all these wars.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.960]   It only made everything worse.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.040]   One of the reasons why Iran is in such a strong position
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.600]   today in the Middle East is because we took out Iraq.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.320]   We basically created a power vacuum in the Middle East
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.680]   that they ended up filling.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.240]   - I recently heard that after Israel struck the embassy
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.360]   in Damascus a few months ago, you may remember this,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.760]   Iran launched a counterattack.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.520]   And you remember there were all these like drones
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.520]   that they sent hundreds of them into Israel,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.560]   but there was supposedly a forewarning
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.000]   that these drones were on the way,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.960]   there was notice given, and it was like, this is it,
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   this is our proportional response, and we're done.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.680]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.640]   - What I heard was that Netanyahu did not wanna stop.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.760]   He wanted to escalate after that response from Iran.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:43.120]   Now, that coupled with what's going on
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.160]   in the West Bank right now,
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.680]   where there is a restricted movement of Palestinians
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.040]   within the West Bank
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.720]   and continued development of Jewish settlements,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.120]   I think really represents a major risk to the region,
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   the Middle East region,
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:02.120]   that we could see an escalation beyond the response
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.840]   that may be mandated or necessary to secure the state
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.880]   that makes things much, much worse in the region
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.800]   and could isolate Israel even further
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.960]   and ultimately draw a lot of powers to that region
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.680]   to try and figure out what side are you on
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.240]   and how do we resolve this?
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.160]   And that could lead to something much bigger
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.360]   and much nastier.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.920]   So I think while we all observe this and watch this,
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.000]   the behavior of the targeted attack in Hamas,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.880]   for me, it's not the issue as much as indicating
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.800]   the capacity of this military and this intelligence
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.920]   that means that they probably feel highly emboldened
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.600]   to take whatever steps individuals feel are necessary
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.560]   to secure the state for the long run,
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.880]   which could mean an increased escalation in conflict.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.280]   And that's, I think, a real kind of point of concern.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.360]   And that's the one of the black swan events,
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.240]   I think, that's still outstanding right now.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.800]   Because if that does happen, if there is, for example,
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.080]   an unraveling of the West Bank,
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.320]   you could see one of these sorts of events
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:05.960]   that everyone gets drawn like a magnet to the Middle East
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.720]   and you end up with a major global conflict
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.520]   that becomes a problem for markets,
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.320]   it becomes a problem for the world.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.120]   And that could be the catalyzing event
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.640]   that I don't think any of us wanna see.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.520]   - To use your logic from before,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.480]   the thing that may plunge the world
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.120]   into having to have a point of view on this
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.040]   may actually be a political calculus
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.720]   that Netanyahu has to engage in,
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.680]   which is around keeping small factions
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.520]   of his coalition government in place,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.400]   which may not actually represent the full view
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.320]   of the Israeli people.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.560]   That's what's even more tragic.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.040]   So it's not, obviously the Palestinians don't want it,
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.840]   but many Israelis may not want it either.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.920]   And there may be no avenue if he wants to remain in power.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.400]   And that's what's so scary.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.600]   - Look, I think there's no question
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.040]   that we're on a path here
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.760]   where we could have a regional war in the Middle East.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.880]   Remember that after Israel hit
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.360]   the Iranian general in Lebanon,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.080]   the Iranians responded two weeks later
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.680]   with that massive drone and missile attack.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.080]   Most of the missiles were intercepted by Iron Dome.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.240]   And I think America participated in that as well.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.720]   I think one or two of them got through.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.360]   And then Israel launched kind of a weak missile attack
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.640]   on Iran, and that was kind of the final word on it.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.360]   There were people in Netanyahu's cabinet,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.880]   like Smotrych and Ben-Gavir,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.040]   sort of the more hardline radical right-wingers,
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.240]   who I think publicly tweeted
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.040]   that they thought Israel's final word on it was weak.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.880]   And they clearly wanted to do more.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.520]   So I think the point is just that
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.360]   when we had this last exchange between Israel and Iran,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.200]   it felt like it was on the verge
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.960]   of tipping over into a regional war.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.560]   But I think partly due to the efforts of the United States,
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.240]   we were able to help tamp that down.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.120]   I think now Iran's promising revenge
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.720]   for what just happened in Tehran,
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.640]   and this could set that escalatory spiral off again.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.480]   - Totally.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.420]   - If you were to place odds on this,
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.500]   I'd say it's at least 50/50 that things escalate
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.340]   into a regional war.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.800]   - It's not as much of a black swat, yeah.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.840]   And by the way, there's no such thing
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.480]   as a regional war in the Middle East,
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.760]   because every one of those countries
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.580]   has significant allies in Russia,
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.520]   in the United States, in China.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.560]   What is Saudi Arabia gonna do?
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.880]   Jordan is gonna end up in a situation
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.600]   where they may end up having to defend
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.480]   the Palestinians in the West Bank,
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.760]   which puts them across the shooting fields
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.160]   from the Israelis.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.080]   And the United States is an ally to both Israel and Jordan.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.680]   What are we gonna end up doing?
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.480]   And that's why this whole situation
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.560]   is not just about a regional conflict,
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.720]   it actually draws the whole world back to the Middle East
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.440]   in a real kind of escalatory scenario.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   - This is why the counterfactual of what could have happened
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.920]   on October 8th is so important,
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   because that would have been UAE, United States, Saudi.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.960]   - Qatar was involved, wasn't it?
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.780]   - And Israel.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.080]   No, just those four.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.200]   And let's put Qatar in the mix as well.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.400]   But my point is like, my gosh,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.840]   it could have rewritten world history in such a profound way.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   It would have just taken some restraint and proportionality.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.880]   - Turn the cheek the other way, kind of.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.400]   - Yeah, it would require incredible forbearance
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.240]   on the part of a population that just been attacked.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.080]   - Attacked and attacked and attacked.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.320]   - With massive atrocities on civilians.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.800]   - But not just this attack,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   like under attack for generations in a region
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.040]   that has been all about conflict and secularity
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.960]   and all of the kind of identity drivers
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.640]   that make this so deeply personal and rooted in history,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.080]   not just in a moment or an event.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.040]   - Look, when it happened to us on 9/11, we lashed out.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.480]   - But the results were not good.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.760]   - Yeah, well, look, let's move on.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.680]   I'm not trying to judge anyone's behavior.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.120]   I'm just trying to shine a light
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.840]   on the strength of Israel's capacity
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.400]   and what that may mean for their proclivity
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.120]   for escalatory behavior, which is really scary
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.840]   given that this is not just a regional issue,
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.480]   it becomes a global issue when it does happen.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.440]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.880]   - I thought you were going somewhere else with it,
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.760]   which is I was just gonna say in any other simulation,
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.400]   the capability of the Mossad is fodder for incredible movies,
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.640]   like it's out of a movie.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.440]   - Right, right.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.260]   - You read these articles
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.360]   and they just don't seem like they're real.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.200]   - Incredible, incredible.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.640]   - It's like, what do you mean you smuggle the bomb
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.840]   into the safe house in Iran where all the VIP stay?
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.280]   - Two months ago, two months ago.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280]   - Two months ago, how does that happen?
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.600]   What does it mean that you actually develop--
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.880]   - An encetype.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.800]   - Yeah, an encetype.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.760]   What does it mean that you developed a virus
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.800]   that you were able to get into the actual working computers
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.920]   of the Iranian nuclear complex?
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.000]   - The control units, by the way, the control units.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   Yeah, the control boards of the equipment made by Siemens,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.080]   of the equipment made by Siemens that was shipped to Iran.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.880]   - That's not like you tell that into something,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.720]   you know what I mean?
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   Like that means that there was a person physically there
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.480]   that then found a way to essentially
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.600]   get this firmware implanted.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.420]   And it's like, this is insane.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.640]   - No, you know what happened?
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.880]   I remember the story.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.320]   They actually did not.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.580]   What happened was they let the virus circulate in the world
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.880]   for years before someone randomly had it on a USB drive
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.040]   that didn't know they had it,
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.960]   randomly plugged it into a computer
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.480]   in the centrifuge facility.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.080]   Then it infected, sent out a notice, I'm in here.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.160]   And then after years, it was finally in there
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.440]   through the random movement of this virus
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.260]   that no one, isn't that incredible?
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.100]   Anyway. - That's incredible.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.640]   - Yeah, well, let's wrap up with the Bill Ackman story.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.680]   - Sorry, before you do that.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.520]   - Yeah.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.340]   - I hate to make this political,
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.320]   but I just have to observe.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.400]   I mean, look at this situation in the world.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.880]   I mean, the Middle East is on the verge of regional war.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.840]   We could be in a war there.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.760]   I should say there could be a regional war there
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.920]   by January 20th when the next president is sworn in.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.520]   You've got the United States in a proxy war with Ukraine.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   You have major tensions with China in East Asia.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.720]   I mean, is this really the time where you wanna put in place
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.560]   an inexperienced president whose policy positions are unclear,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.360]   who's untested, was never even tested by a primary,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.440]   who the media refuses to test now,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.640]   who's basically a media construct?
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.420]   This seems to me like a really bad idea.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.880]   - All right, so political pitch in from David Sacks.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.480]   We don't have Jake out here to give the other side,
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.520]   but let's keep going.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.120]   So Bill Ackman's withdrawn his plans to IPO Pershing Square.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.480]   You know, Chamath, do you wanna just give us
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.840]   kind of the background on what he was trying to do?
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.840]   And obviously this was an attempted $25 billion raise
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.960]   as an IPO.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.800]   He recently reduced the raise target to 2 billion.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.560]   And when the order book came in,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.160]   I believe at less than a billion,
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.960]   he scrapped the plans entirely and just announced yesterday
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.560]   that he's pulling the IPO.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.880]   So can you just explain a little bit about what this IPO was
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.160]   and then we'll talk a little bit about
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.880]   why we think it fell apart.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.280]   - I can only repeat what I read,
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.160]   but I'll try to kind of like translate it
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.520]   into non-Wall Street speak.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.440]   So basically he has a company,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.480]   but what that company does is it gets investors
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.920]   to give it/him money.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.000]   And then they invest it in all kinds of things
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.080]   that they deem worthwhile.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.400]   It could be bonds, it could be stocks,
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.780]   it could be currencies, it could be derivatives.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.800]   They generate a return,
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   and then they give those returns back to their investors.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.720]   So that is a hedge fund.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.520]   The Holy Grail has always been trying to figure out
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.360]   how can an organization that has--
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.160]   - Those funds are raised and distributed back, right?
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.440]   I mean, I think you should--
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.280]   - Exactly. - I don't want to mean
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.480]   to interrupt, but yeah, just go ahead and say that, yeah.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.240]   - But the Holy Grail for someone who runs those businesses
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.880]   is when they realize, well, listen,
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.800]   I get paid a great profit share
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.600]   from those funds when I'm successful.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.480]   I'm also allowed to take a 2% per year management fee,
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.160]   but I believe I'm building equity.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.720]   And can I get somebody else to recognize the fact
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.600]   that I'm building equity?
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.360]   And that's no different than a startup, right?
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.480]   So, you know, Freeberg, you're building O'Halo.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.000]   You believe that you're building
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.800]   all kinds of really interesting things rooted in science,
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.400]   and you want other people to judge the value of that
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.640]   as measured by your equity, right?
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.600]   Independent of your revenues and profits today,
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.640]   they want to project into the future.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.120]   The problem is that hedge funds
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.600]   have not found a very elegant way to demonstrate
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.200]   that they have any equity value.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.160]   And there's only been a few,
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.760]   and the formula has been the same.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   So companies like Blackstone, companies like KKR,
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.480]   companies like Apollo, what have they proven?
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.440]   They've proven that they can raise
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.800]   enormous amounts of money.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.760]   So most of these organizations now
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   are approaching a trillion dollars of capital raised.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.120]   And they tell investors, well, look,
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.760]   don't worry about the returns anymore.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.400]   Worry about the 2%, because that's like our revenue.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.840]   And we're generating $20 billion a year of revenue
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.520]   that'll grow at some rateable proportion.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   We'll manage the teams, we'll compensate them well,
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.360]   but there'll be lots of profitability.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.560]   And people have bought that story.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.160]   So I think a lot of smaller organizations
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.600]   who aspire to be like a Blackstone or an Apollo
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.200]   have tried to get people to buy into this story.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.120]   And I think what Bill Ackman was trying to do
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.840]   was some version of that, which is to say,
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.160]   I'm going to build an enterprise here.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.760]   Pershing Square is going to be a standalone business.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.840]   It's going to have enterprise value.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.520]   And you're gonna measure that
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.320]   based on the assets that I manage.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.360]   And it's going to be much greater than what I manage today.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.240]   And I think he manages roughly 10 billion today,
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.960]   but he thought he was gonna raise another 25 in this IPO,
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.640]   and then in very short order, be at 50 billion.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.200]   And so he got people to invest in that business
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.040]   on that premise.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.880]   And I think folks put in around a billion dollars,
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   and they valued that entity at 10 billion.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.920]   And so he tried to go and raise his fund.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.800]   He thought it was gonna be 25.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.920]   And it turned out, I thought it was two,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.720]   but Friedberg, you just said it's less than one.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.000]   I didn't, I guess, or around one.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:55.840]   I just heard that.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.960]   I'm just hearing that from you for the first time.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.480]   So I guess, what is the takeaway?
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.640]   Like, Samath, real quick.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.200]   This was a closed-end fund he was trying to raise.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.680]   No, but I think he's also said
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.040]   that Pershing Square eventually has a path to go public.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.360]   That's how he sold the billion of equity at 10 billion
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.720]   in the master LP.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.840]   - Yeah, but this IPO was just for a fund.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.240]   It was just a- - No, no, I know.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.440]   It was the IPO of the fund,
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.520]   and then they were planning afterwards, the IPO-
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.000]   - They were planning afterwards, yes, which he didn't do.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.160]   - My only point was that the fund was,
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.560]   basically, it's launching a fund,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.680]   and then the goal is not the fund itself.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.720]   The goal is to buttress the underlying logic
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.480]   to take the whole thing public, the management.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.600]   - Okay, okay.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.880]   - And that's what I mean by taking a company public
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.080]   in finance is next to impossible.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:39.920]   - Yeah.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.240]   - So the whole point is like,
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.440]   what are these businesses in the business of doing?
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.720]   They're in the business of making bets.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.600]   The problem is that those bets
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.000]   are short-term anomalous events.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.520]   Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't work.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.400]   And the problem with that is that investors
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.120]   who are trying to underwrite 20 or 30 years of returns
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.680]   don't know how that's predictable over that period of time.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.720]   Like for example, you're genetically engineering
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.080]   all kinds of produce that we are going to ingest.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.960]   If that stuff works at scale,
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.280]   you will have built an enterprise
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.960]   that theoretically has the potential,
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.760]   unless it's disrupted by something else,
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   to make revenue for 20 or 30 years.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.880]   So people can underwrite that.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.200]   Google makes a search engine.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.880]   It's going to last for 20 or 30 years.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.320]   Facebook makes a social network.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.520]   It can last for 20 or 30 years.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.840]   The business of making bets is typically something
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.560]   that can only be measured in days or weeks.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560]   Maybe months at best.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.600]   And so I think what he ran into was that realization.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.160]   It's very hard to get people
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.280]   to value an institution in this way.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.760]   And so the thing did not work.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.440]   He'll go back and he'll retool.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.640]   The thing that I give Bill Ackman
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.960]   an enormous amount of credit for
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.080]   is he is one of the most resilient individuals
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.640]   I've ever seen in high finance,
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.440]   but generally as a business person.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.280]   This guy has, he surfed some really big waves.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.000]   He's landed some really good sets.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.800]   He's also gotten crushed a few times
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.320]   and the guy just keeps coming back
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.920]   and he seems to be getting more and more refined
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.240]   and capable as a business person.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.600]   So, you know, he'll probably figure out a way.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.480]   This is not the first time he's publicly dealt
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.320]   with things that have not worked.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.840]   But I think it just goes to show you that in finance,
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   these entities that try to sell a piece
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.480]   of the "general partner" as a company,
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.960]   I just think that it's, frankly, that it doesn't work.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   And this is just, you know, an example,
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.800]   yet another example that there's not a lot
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.600]   of equity value in these businesses.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.640]   - Sax, some reports indicate that investors pulled out
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.800]   of the Pershing Square IPO
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.400]   because of the current market conditions
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.000]   that a lot of market indices have stormed higher
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.800]   and that there is now less upside
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.080]   and it's not a great time to be entering the equity markets.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.920]   Other reports indicate that investors lost interest
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:11.920]   in Ackman's fund because of his activity on X or Twitter.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.720]   Have you, do you have a point of view?
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.080]   Do you think that folks pulled out,
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.040]   investors have pulled out?
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.480]   You're obviously a fund manager who is very active
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.040]   and opinionated on X or Twitter.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.240]   Like, you know, do you think,
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.320]   has this affected your relationship with raising capital?
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.480]   If you're willing to talk about it
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.800]   or maybe just comment on the Ackman,
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.360]   you know, issue that he ran into, why did this fail?
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.200]   - I just don't know.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.640]   I honestly haven't followed his IPO process at all.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.400]   I would say that the market we have right now,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.080]   it's not the best it's been, but it's also not the worst.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.240]   So I'm always reluctant to blame macro conditions
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.640]   without having a more specific explanation.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.720]   - Do you have a point of view on investors
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.480]   having an issue with Ackman because of his outspokenness
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.680]   on various social and political issues over?
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.920]   - I can't imagine, no, I can't imagine that.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.040]   - I don't think so.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.720]   Investors care about making money
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.120]   and Bill Ackman's a moneymaker.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.280]   Like that's undeniable.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.760]   The guy takes some losses,
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.680]   but his wins are way bigger than his losses.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.160]   And he is a proven moneymaker.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.400]   The problem is that I think the way in which
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.600]   he was trying to monetize the business
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.720]   is just a hard thing to do.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.400]   You have to have an organization of hundreds
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.760]   approaching thousands of people that are raising
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.600]   all manner of funds.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.080]   And those funds just deliver very consistent returns,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.280]   not great, but they never lose money.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.320]   And that's how you get towards a trillion dollars.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.680]   And that's how you make it a company
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.040]   and not a great hedge fund.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.920]   - Yeah, let me also just say,
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.040]   I think he's very thoughtful on Twitter.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.320]   I've gotten into some disagreements with him on Twitter,
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.720]   other things I've agreed with,
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.760]   but overall I think he makes a strong case for himself.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.120]   I haven't heard him say anything out of bounds on Twitter,
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.360]   whether you agree with it or not.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.280]   So I can't imagine that that's a problem.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.320]   - Some people would disagree.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.120]   They think he's had a lot of comments on wokeism,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.120]   as he would call it, and DEI topics, and Donald Trump.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:05.960]   - Well, I agree with him on that.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.880]   And I think the vast majority of the country
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.600]   agrees that woke has jumped the shark.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.280]   - Yeah, but I think some people highlight.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.440]   - If woke is so great,
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.960]   why is Kamala Harris trying to distance herself
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.040]   from every previous comment she's ever made
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.240]   about wokeism or DEI?
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.320]   The point is more about like what we talked about earlier,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.120]   which is kind of having an authentic voice
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.640]   and speaking what you believe
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.680]   and speaking what your opinion is,
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.040]   versus remaining buttoned up
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.960]   and not speaking what you believe and toeing the line.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.160]   - He's in the only industry
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.160]   where his performance is measurable every day in precision.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.680]   So what I would say is,
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.040]   it's irrelevant what he says on Twitter,
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.320]   meaning the quality of his decisions
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.360]   are independent of what he says,
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.600]   because they're measurable
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.440]   and they are not something you can gain.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.760]   And the reality is that over the last few years,
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.560]   particularly starting in COVID,
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.680]   he has gotten better and better
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.120]   and he's played a very good hand.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   I think he's an exceptional risk manager and he's timed it.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.280]   And so the people that say that to you,
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.520]   to be very honest, they're somewhat,
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.080]   they're portraying their lack of financial sophistication.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.480]   - Yeah, and actually, can I go further?
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.040]   And I actually think that Ackman's presence
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.840]   on TwitterX is a huge positive for him.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.480]   It's an asset because he has a gigantic followership
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.040]   and he's able to speak directly to his audience
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.960]   in the way that we do.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.920]   And I think the reason why people say these things
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.560]   is because they don't have a direct strategy.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.640]   And so they want to basically bad mouth people who do.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.120]   But again, if you don't go direct to your audience,
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.320]   then you have to go through the media
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.680]   and then they get to define you.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.440]   - And it creates ambiguity.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.280]   - Exactly.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.040]   So I think the fact that he's got what,
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.960]   like a million plus followers and everything he puts out
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.240]   gets tens of thousands of likes, it's a huge positive.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.160]   - Huge positive.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   And I think that the part of his business
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.320]   that he hasn't gone back to,
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.760]   which if he does in this chapter of his career
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.480]   with the following that he has,
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.520]   is the activism part.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.120]   And I think there are two people
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.240]   who I think are incredible at this
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.720]   and where both the written and the spoken word,
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.960]   they have such a mastery of.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.760]   Ackman is one, Dan Loeb is the other.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.880]   And I think that in this world
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.240]   where you have the ability to go direct
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.080]   in a way that you've never had before
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.080]   is actually the realm of a different form of activism
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:40.280]   that I think could be extremely economically rewarding
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.040]   and valuable in society.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.200]   All right, gentlemen, this has been a great episode
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.040]   of "The All In Pod".
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.320]   We missed our comedian in residence, Jason Calacanis.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.240]   Nostrocanis, nostril, anus.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.120]   We miss him.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.800]   We wish him well, speedy recovery.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.520]   This has been an episode without the usual humor
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.440]   and flamboyancy that we've all come to know and love.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.920]   But I think it was great to chat this afternoon
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.720]   and we will see you all next week.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.560]   Bye-bye.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.400]   - Love you, boys.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.240]   - Bye. - I gotcha.
