[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   Chasten from Savannah, Georgia asks, "Pastor John, should we as Christians give
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.520]   to people begging on the street?" Well that question is not foreign to me. I
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   have wrestled with it for 33 years because that's how long I've lived in
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.040]   this neighborhood. When I lived out in New Brighton, I virtually never faced
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.880]   that. For the last 33 years, I have faced it almost every day, just to give the
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.800]   listener a taste of where I live. Today, today, I was driving over, no, I was
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.440]   walking over and a man with his little cardboard sheet saying he needs work or
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.040]   needs money was standing at the corner of the exit ramp of, onto 11th Avenue and
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   the street where I live. So I deal with that person, those people, most
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.440]   often right there, walking by them rather than driving by them. So yeah, it's real
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.800]   and here's my, here's the answer and it's where I am right now, it's what I think
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.400]   is biblical. My answer, should you give to those who ask, say knocking at your
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:22.160]   door or asking on the street, and my answer is usually yes. Usually the
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.760]   default should be yes, and here's my reason. Selfishness is so dominant in my
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:39.960]   heart, I am reflexively hard toward this person. He makes me mad. I want to say get
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.880]   a job. I'm not even interested in his story, I'm not interested in his
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.840]   condition. My reflex is anger, my reflex is get a life, and I think that's a
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.240]   sinful reflex. I do not think that's godly for me to respond that way, I think
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.680]   that's the old nature creeping up in me, and I think that's the reason Jesus said
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   the radical things he did to me in Matthew 5. You have heard that it was said,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.240]   "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," but I say to you, don't resist the one
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.440]   who's evil. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to the other. You can
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000]   imagine how hard that is. I hate to be slapped on the cheek, and Jesus says turn
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.180]   the other cheek, because he knows that would be a miracle, that would be a
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.680]   miracle in me if I turned the other cheek and had some sense of compassion
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.480]   for this person. And then he adds, "If anyone would sue you, take your tunic, let
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   him have your cloak," so we know we're being ripped off. A lot of people say, "Yeah,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.240]   but he's ripping me off." Well of course you're being ripped off, you know it. In
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.640]   this text you know it. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him too. Give
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   to the one who begs from you, do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.160]   Now I've got to have some really good reasons to go against that text, so my
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.400]   first answer is default response, generosity. Be ripped off. Risk being
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   ripped off rather than being shrewd enough to say, "I didn't get ripped off." I
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.280]   have never slept well reminding myself how shrewd I was not being ripped off. I
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.880]   have often slept well thinking, "Okay, I probably got taken advantage of, but my
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.860]   heart was good today. My heart was right today." Now having said that, I know a lot
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.280]   of veteran urban people are getting on my case right now, having said that, I want
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.600]   to say I don't think that's an absolute. I don't think giving to the one who asks
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.320]   is the only way Jesus means for us to love people. So here are a few other
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.120]   principles. Love does no harm. Romans 13, 10. Love does no wrong to a neighbor,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   doesn't harm a neighbor, therefore love fulfills the law. So you do have to ask,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   "Am I harming him?" Love aims to do good. You shall love your neighbor and hate
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   your enemy, but I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.080]   you. That means pray for their good, doesn't pray for their harm, and so you
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   want this person's good, and you don't want to just feed their bad habits, and
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.640]   that's the argument that's usually used for why you shouldn't give to them. And
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.960]   then love has real compassion. The parable of the good
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.400]   Samaritan, it closes with what? Who proved to be neighbor to this man? And
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840]   the answer is the one who showed compassion, and Jesus said, "Go do that. Go
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.120]   be compassionate." There are ways to measure your love rather than just
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.040]   giving. Whatever you would that others would do to you, do so to them, and would
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.280]   you want others to just feed your bad habits? So here's what happens. I
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.480]   have a person who's there, and if I don't have time to do anything else, I think I
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   should just give. If I have time to do more, I want to have a conversation.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.040]   I want to say, "You know, I have found in this neighborhood that just giving money
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.600]   really doesn't help people. People are not helped. I want to help you. What do
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   you really need?" "Oh, I need a bus trip to get over to St. Paul to see my mom." I said,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.560]   "Well, look, I'll take you." "No, I don't want you to take me." That's a huge
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.520]   commitment to say, "I'll take you. Get in the car." I mean, I have gotten in the car
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.400]   at 10 o'clock at night and driven people over to North Minneapolis, and I
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   know that they tell me to let them out, and it's nowhere. It's just nowhere, and I
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.280]   know I've been taken advantage of because they were trying in the car to
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.480]   get what they wanted all the way along, but when I get home, I sleep well. Instead
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.120]   of saying, "You idiot! It's 10 o'clock at night. Why are you knocking on my door?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.920]   Get out of here. Come back in the morning." I go back up, and I think, "Well, what was
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.600]   that?" That wasn't--that was pure flesh. That was pure flesh to respond like that.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.560]   So, I suppose the short answer is default, give, then do more, and in some cases
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   say, "No money, but I'll take and get you the food you need. I'll get you the
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.680]   diapers you need. I'll get you where you need to go, but I don't think it's wise
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.800]   for me to give you money." It always humbles and convicts me to hear of the
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.520]   ways that you care for the homeless in your neighborhood. Pastor John, thank you,
