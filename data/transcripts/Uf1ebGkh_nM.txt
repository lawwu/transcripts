[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.560]   My name is Darek Kwecek, and I work
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.000]   as a machine learning engineer in the growth team
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   at Weights & Biases.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.720]   I'm thrilled to be a part of this course on building
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.520]   LLM-powered applications.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   Chris Alban, director of machine learning at Wikimedia,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   said something very inspiring not long ago.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920]   He talked about the unique opportunity
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560]   we have now with LLMs.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.480]   The field is being created as we speak,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.440]   which means that if you join in now,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.560]   you can be there from the very beginning and become an expert.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   Even the experts in this field have only
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240]   started exploring it recently, so the barriers to entry
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.800]   are low.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.920]   By taking this course and starting
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.760]   to build apps with LLMs, you'll have a big advantage
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   when the industry matures.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.560]   If you're already interested in LLMs,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.200]   then you probably don't need to be convinced
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.160]   of their impact on the world.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.800]   But just to show you how pervasive they are,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.320]   check out this market map from Sequoia.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.880]   LLMs appear in various industries
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   and support a wide range of functions.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600]   We at Weights & Biases are also in this space
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.320]   and have developed our own LLM Ops toolset.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.200]   We want to help you get started on the right foot.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.240]   We assume some Python programming experience,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.480]   but we don't make many other assumptions
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   about your background.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   We'll provide you with key concepts, starting advice,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.960]   and a process that you can follow
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.080]   to make continuous improvements to your applications.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   We believe that one day you could even
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   teach your own LLM class.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.560]   During this course, we'll show you the Prompt Engineering
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.280]   workflow and how Weights & Biases supports it.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.400]   We'll share with you our very own app
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520]   that helps Weights & Biases users get support
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.880]   via our Discord community server.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760]   We'll take steps together towards building
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.080]   a similar application and provide you
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640]   with a process to follow to improve your app continuously.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.480]   Lastly, we also invite you to join our Discord community,
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.560]   where you can chat with fellow participants
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.360]   and ask us any questions you may have.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.480]   We're excited to get started and show you how to build
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.640]   LLM-powered applications.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.960]   In the next video, we'll jump right into our Discord server
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.480]   and show you an example of an LLM-powered application.
