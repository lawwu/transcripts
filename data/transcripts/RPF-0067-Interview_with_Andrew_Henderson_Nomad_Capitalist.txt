[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast on today's show.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:40.880]   What factors should internationalization play in your plans?
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I thank you for being here. My name is Joshua
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.400]   Sheets and I'm your host. Today's show is going to be an interview with Andrew Henderson, founder
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.560]   of Nomad Capitalist. And today we're going to stick with the theme of the show and move over
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.960]   to the more radical and I call it juicy side of talking about finance. I hope you enjoy.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.480]   You know, there's a an interest that I've had for a very long time of looking at the more
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.120]   hardcore people who are willing to actually put their money where their mouth is and pursue some
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.680]   of the more radical sides of personal finance, which is clear if you've listened to even a single
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.160]   instance of the show. And there's nothing that I consider to be more interesting and more radical
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440]   than talking about some of the the ways that you can move internationally and getting outside of
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   the context of the US American reality. But it's an area that I have almost no knowledge in, other
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.080]   than just simply casually reading a little here and there. And so I've gone out and brought to you
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.440]   the very best person that I could find on it. And it's a man named Andrew Henderson, who writes over
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.640]   at Nomad Capitalist.com. He has an excellent website. And so we brought him on to teach me
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.320]   and teach all of us some of the places to start when it comes to internationalization. Andrew,
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640]   welcome to the show. Joshua, thank you for having me. I have to tell you,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.480]   that intro music is way too hip and way too laid back for me.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.800]   You know, I ran I found that so randomly when I was I did I had to get intro music,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.280]   I got to get into music and I found it out randomly found it on a website for somebody.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.720]   And I just it gets me dancing. So it usually gets my gets me my energy up when starting the show
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   off. And so I figure it's a win win if it gets me energetic, so I'm glad you like it.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.320]   I'm ready to roll. So let's start with just give us a little bit about your story.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360]   Where did you are? Have you always been Mr. International Man of Mystery, Mr. James Bond,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.160]   living abroad, growing up abroad as a foreign expat or share with us a little bit about your
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.120]   story and background? Well, you know, I've shared this story. I'm glad you asked. I grew up in Ohio
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   of all places. I grew up in the Midwest. It's a place that has a lot of advantages. But also,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.040]   I think a lot of people, they just kind of it encourages people to kind of nestle in and just
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.880]   kind of look within rather than externally. I was always a little bit different when I was 12 years
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.440]   old. My parents unwittingly taught me. We were driving around and they taught me what I now call
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.480]   the five magic words. And that is go where you're treated best. They said, listen, we see the
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.200]   trajectory that this country, the United States is heading in. And we believe that there will be a
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   time that people like yourself who want to be successful, who want to accomplish something,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.920]   who want to be leaders will no longer be welcome here. They'll no longer be able to do what they
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.480]   do and just to be kind of to be left alone. And obviously, they were very, very right. And so,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.760]   you know, I took that advice to heart. I did not travel or live all over the world as a kid. I did
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   go to different places in Europe. I saw some of the things that were happening there when I was
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.440]   9, 10, 11 years old. And I realized some of the problems that were happening there. But I never
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.760]   entirely knew what direction that my life would take. And so, it wasn't until my early 20s, I just
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.360]   started traveling and experiencing these things and realizing that there is a reality outside of
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.680]   the US propaganda machine, outside of the US financial system, that there are opportunities,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.760]   there are different ways of thinking, and that you actually can make a living, can survive.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.680]   You're not going to get eaten by crocodiles if you set foot outside of the arbitrary lines that
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.120]   our government establishes for us. I feel like I've learned some of my
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.280]   most important lessons from traveling. And you're totally right about, you have a lot of times you
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.520]   have these misconceptions that I don't know why they're built into us, but they certainly seem to
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.600]   be part of the US American culture. I know we have some international listeners as well, so I don't
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.320]   want to be too US American focused. But we have this idea that somehow we're the best, we're the
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.200]   best in the world, and everywhere else is just scary and dangerous. Until you actually go travel,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.520]   then you find out that, A, we may not be the best in the world, at least at some things.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.760]   There are lots of places that are cleaner, that are more modern, that are more amazing to be,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.400]   that seem like more fun, and that have way more opportunities. And I don't know why that,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   it seems to be just a hallmark of so many people that if they go on walkabout, as the Australians
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.720]   would say, if they go on walkabout, they get exposed to a whole new way of thinking. I know
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   travel certainly did that for me. Well, and here's the problem. You see stuff
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.600]   posted all over Facebook and everywhere else that talks about, "Oh, the US is the wealthiest
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.760]   country and here's why." There's a total disregard for statistics in the Western world, and in the
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.920]   US in particular, because the US is so geographically isolated from other countries,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.320]   that the United States is not the wealthiest country in the world. By some standards,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.800]   it's 12th, it's 13th, whatever the case may be, but there's this need to be number one.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.080]   No one wants to pay attention to statistics. I'm a numbers guy. I want to go, as I said,
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   go where I'm treated best. Where are the best banks, the most stable banks? Where is the best
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.600]   place to set up a company? Where is the most free economy? And even for entertainment, where is
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.400]   the best classical music? Where's the best place to live? I don't want to be in the 12th or the 13th
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.360]   best place merely because I need to satisfy some kind of propaganda. But even if it was,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.600]   here's the important distinction. Even if it was the wealthiest country in the world, I was just
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.320]   in Hong Kong hosting an event for members of my private club last week. And we had a guy who's a
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.440]   venture capital guy there talking about the difference between hiring in New York City
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.080]   and hiring in Hong Kong, both highly international financial centers, great places to live.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.320]   But Hong Kong's way better, in my opinion. I haven't lived in New York, I haven't lived in
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.400]   Hong Kong, but I would move to Hong Kong in an instant before I moved to New York.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.920]   You're absolutely right. The weather's better, the gambling nearby is better,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   a lot more diversity, better. I'm 100% with you. But you hire a guy in New York, fresh out of
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.840]   college, average salary, 60 grand. You pay 20 or 30 grand in payroll tax, because of other nonsense.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.920]   He goes out, the government takes 20 or 25 grand of his check, then he goes and tries to find
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.160]   an apartment for rent in Manhattan. Well, he's got 36 or 37 grand left of that money. He's
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.200]   working in Manhattan. Well, guess what the cost of rent in Manhattan just so happens to be?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.640]   36, 37 grand a year to live near his office. Isn't it interesting how water seeks its own level?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.960]   Sure.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.640]   You go to Hong Kong, you hire a kid out of college for 45 grand, you pay like $1,000
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.560]   in social costs. He goes out, he pays very little tax. He's got more money left over than the kid in
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.240]   New York. The employer's happier, everybody's happier. It really comes down to those kinds
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.920]   of things. Where can you go and be treated best? Where is your money treated the best?
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.560]   That's the reality that Western countries don't want to understand, Joshua, is that
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.840]   capital is very fungible. It goes where it is treated best. That's why it's all in Hong Kong,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.320]   it's all in Singapore. It's leaving places like New York, like London, even Switzerland,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.480]   because it's found a better place where it's more well-respected.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.040]   I learned this in two ways that I found interesting, and I'm sure you would have
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.600]   experience with both of them. One of them, I live in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.080]   worked professionally as a financial advisor here locally for about six years. As part of that work,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   I had opportunity to sit with a portfolio manager for a private family office for a Palm Beach
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.840]   family. I used to walk across Palm Beach through the financial district and around Worth Avenue
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.760]   when I was growing up in college just for the evening walk to get to the beach. I got to meet
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   a few different people that work in some of the local family offices for some of the wealthy
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:01.040]   families. I got to be closer with this one person, again, who was part of about a five-person team
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.720]   for this private family office for one individual family. He shared with me some of the projects
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.120]   that they were working on. This was during the real estate bust in the United States
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.080]   about four or five years ago. They were actively building a bunch of real estate projects, but all
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.360]   of them were condo projects in India. It opened up. It's something that most people, the average
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.240]   client on the street would talk to and say, "Well, real estate's a terrible investment."
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.560]   Well, wait a second. Real estate's not necessarily a terrible investment. It's just you might not
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.040]   want to be building condos in Miami at the moment. That's a glutted market. But there are some very
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.160]   smart people, very sophisticated, building some amazing real estate projects in India.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:49.280]   You just have to have your eye open to it. I always think of that example when I read your
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.080]   work because it seems like that's what you're heavily focused on.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.680]   Boy, you're exactly right. You know the phrase, "There's always a bull market somewhere." People
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.560]   get so bogged down. For years, I was bogged down with this minutiae as well, where you live in the
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.440]   United States and you say, "Boy, I hope Mitt Romney gets elected and he solves all the problems and
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   he's going to make it great for business again." It's like, "Great." Look what happened the last
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:20.800]   time. You elected a guy and you lowered tax rates from 39.6% to 35%. Like, woo-hoo, pop the champagne.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.560]   You still have Bibles upon Bibles upon Bibles of regulations just from one agency to where you can't
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.760]   build your company's warehouse on somewhere where there's a spotted sparrow that used to live and
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.480]   lay eggs in the 17th century. That's not gone anywhere. But somehow, if we elect the right
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.800]   people, that's going to solve all of our problems. So rather than get bogged down on that, I finally
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.840]   realized, "Listen, there are places where you can go and not only do they treat you better,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.800]   lower taxes, lower cost of living." You and I were talking before the show how I had to go to the
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.840]   hospital today here in Malaysia. It cost like a tiny fraction of what it would cost in the United
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.280]   States. On top of that, yes, there's always a bull market somewhere. So I'm looking at places like
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.640]   Cambodia. I'm looking at places around Asia, some places in Eastern Europe, Colombia, Panama,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.240]   Nicaragua, a lot of countries that used to be communists or socialists or have dictators that
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.000]   have learned their lesson and they understand now where their bread is buttered. Joshua, just look
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   at where I'm at in Kuala Lumpur. You go down 45 minutes by air to Singapore, a country that just
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.680]   celebrated what, almost five decades in existence. They broke away from what was then Malaya, now
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.560]   Malaysia 50 years ago. Look at what they've done in 50 years. Look at what they did. Nobody thought
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.520]   they stood a chance, 236 square miles of land in the middle of the ocean on the tip of Southeast
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.880]   Asia. Now that Britain was gone, who was going to help them? What was going to happen? Well,
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.600]   they realized we know what motivates people at their core, not government, not taxes, not, well,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.080]   you should just pay your fair share. No, they understood that bringing business in, bringing
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.720]   capital in, having people store their gold there, having people bank there, that's what would
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.280]   generate wealth for the people who live there. They understand what really motivates people.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.040]   And that's what you have to understand. And when you understand that, you can figure out where
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.720]   are people moving, where are people becoming middle class, where are the middle class becoming
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.880]   upper class, where are people becoming new consumers? And you can go there and invest
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.440]   your money. And the average person will think that you're insane, that, oh, Colombia, that's like,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.720]   you know, the drug hotspot. But, you know, in my mind, that means that you're doing something right.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   Right. I have a question about Singapore. I haven't been there yet.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   And, but my dad says it's his favorite city in the world.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.040]   I've been to Disney World before.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.920]   I have.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.680]   It's the same thing, but with more banks.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.680]   Okay. I believe that because I've been to Hong Kong. And I know that at least
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.040]   on Hong Kong Island, that's kind of how I picture much of Singapore being,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:08.640]   except prettier, probably, and greener, if that's possible. How, in your experience being there,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:15.600]   because my understanding is that Singapore is incredibly liberty-minded, economically speaking,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:23.440]   but incredibly dictatorial when it comes to how they govern the populace. And it seems to be
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.320]   this, almost like the brilliant success of a benevolent dictator. I don't remember who the
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.160]   guy is. I've got his biography on my reading list of the guy who was, I don't remember the name,
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.040]   but the person who kind of was single-handedly responsible for that transformation. How does
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.280]   Singapore integrate that personal liberty and economic liberty balance and do it so well?
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.080]   Well, I mean, it's a great question that you asked, and it really comes down to the concept
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.640]   that we talk about on Nomadic Capitalist, which is flag theory. And again, diversifying your
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.680]   different affairs around the world to benefit from the best that each place has to offer.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   I mean, listen, I personally would not live in Singapore. I don't think. It's expensive. It's
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   almost too clean for me. I like a little bit of grit. I like in Hong Kong where guys are throwing
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.720]   fish across backs, alleyways, and there's some grit, even amongst the great wealth that's there.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.160]   But in Singapore, you're right. People are very restricted. They don't sell chewing gum there,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.400]   for instance. If you drink bottled water on the subway, it's a $500 fine.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   How do they manage that? I mean, again, listen, at the end of the day, I mean, I sound like,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:42.000]   what's the guy in The Simpsons? I don't watch TV, but Mr. Burns, is it? Because it's all about the
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.120]   money all the time. But in reality, when it comes to economics, it is all about the money all the
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.880]   time. They're not, you know, it's not so anti-liberty that you can't live there, but it's
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.520]   not a place that I personally would want to live. So how do they manage it? Well, I mean, people
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.080]   there, they're perfect for the banking and the financial services industry. There is a growing
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.360]   bed of entrepreneurship, but it's not the most entrepreneurial country because it is kind of
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.640]   robotic in that sense. But I mean, the answer to that is not to think of it in the way that
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.600]   my parents wanted me to do when I was 12 years old, where they said, "Well, go to New Zealand,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.080]   that's the next best place." No, you go to New Zealand and you cherry pick the best parts. You
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.360]   go to Singapore and you cherry pick the best parts. Then you come here to Malaysia and you
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.720]   cherry pick the best parts. So you diversify your affairs to where you're only keeping your money in
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.200]   Singapore, but you're not living there. You're not paying $5,000 a month for an apartment.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.400]   You're not paying $80,000 a year to register your car, or I guess $80,000 once to register a car
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.040]   every time you buy one. I mean, you're not doing any of that. So listen, every country on earth
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.400]   has the benefit of a certain number of tax slaves living within its borders that largely are just
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.360]   going to stay there and do whatever they're told to do. If you want to be different and you want
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.240]   to escape that system and you want true personal and economic freedom, you have to know how to
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:09.280]   harvest the best things that each place has to offer. Explain the concept of flag theory and
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.880]   share as far as where you see some for instituting for each flag, where you see some of the global
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.440]   opportunities in today's world. It started out a number of decades ago as three flag theory.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.040]   And I believe that the three was, you have your business based somewhere, you have a residency
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.200]   in a country with low taxes, you have citizenship in a country that doesn't tax your worldwide
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.080]   income. And so basically what you do is you basically work as this perpetual tourist where
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.000]   you're not really a formal resident of wherever it is you live. So I mean, if you're running a
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.960]   business that is global in nature or online in nature, you can have that business in a place
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   like Hong Kong or Singapore, which is low tax and very well developed. You can have it in a
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.480]   jurisdiction that's no tax like Nevis, Seychelles, there's all kinds of them popping up now. Gambia
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.440]   is trying to become an offshore financial center. So you have your company there and then you live
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:10.240]   in a country, for example, where I live in Malaysia, where income I earn outside of Malaysia
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.800]   is not taxed. They have a territorial tax system. If I were to get a job here, I would pay tax.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.920]   But if I have money from a Hong Kong company, that money's not sent to me here in Malaysia,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.200]   I don't pay any tax. Then if you can get a citizenship that doesn't tax you based on where
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   you live, for example, anything other than the United States, basically, then you don't have
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.680]   to report any of your income overseas to that country. And so those are some of the ways that
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.480]   people do it by getting second passports, by getting residencies in low tax countries,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.440]   moving their business offshore, moving their banking offshore. And there are so many other
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.360]   flags that you can do from the location that your website server is in for greater privacy.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:58.560]   I mean, there's so many different things that you can do from banking, where you store your gold,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.320]   a country that respects gold ownership. I mean, you can think of any number of different things
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.400]   to protect yourself, all the way down to, as I said, we do have a Philharmonic here in Kuala
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.840]   Lumpur. But when I want quality classical music, quality opera, I go to Vienna, I go to Riga,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.680]   I go to Budapest. So figuring out how to make that work for you can really enhance the quality
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   of your life and put a lot more money in your pocket to where that 60 grand a year that you
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.960]   might make in New York, it all becomes your money to do what you want and make the change that you
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:37.120]   want to make. We spend a lot of time on my show talking about the nuts and bolts of good planning,
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:44.400]   especially good tax planning, how to legally avoid as many taxes as possible through effective
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.280]   planning. And I don't even mind going over to the tax evasion side. I've interviewed
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.880]   one person on that, and I find it a topic of great interest. But I do certainly think sometimes about
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   the value of just simply saying, "Why don't we just dispense with the whole US-American tax code?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   If I don't like it, why don't I just go somewhere else?" But the problem is that the US, is it the
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.280]   only country in the world that taxes your income, or is it just one of the few that taxes your
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.120]   income no matter where you are in it, no matter where you are, that basically as long as you're
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:21.840]   a US citizen, you've got the hooks in you. You're a slave, you're a tax slave.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.560]   It is basically the only country where you are a slave until you cease to be a United States
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   citizen. There are some countries that make it a little bit harder where you have to cut
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.520]   all of your ties, Canada, Australia, where you actually need to prove certain things
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.160]   in order to get off the hook. But other than the war-torn country of Eritrea,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.000]   which was a breakaway state from Ethiopia, it was in civil war, in a bloody coup for years,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.120]   other than Eritrea, which doesn't even enforce their policy, the United States is the only one
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.080]   that does tax people based on their worldwide income, and that makes it difficult.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:00.800]   There are ways to get around it, and I'm not a tax guy. I go around the world and spend all
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   the money I have to meet all the experts and to bring together their knowledge and aggregate what
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.040]   they know, so I'm not the tax guy. But if you live overseas and you're spending all of your time
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.520]   out of the US, even as a US citizen, you can exempt about $100,000 a year from US income tax.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.880]   If you set up some of the offshore structures that we talk about, there are different ways that
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.480]   you can do that, and you can get pretty intricate. You don't really need to in most cases, but you
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.520]   can. And you can exempt more of that money to where-- I mean, look at what Google and Apple
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.920]   and Facebook and all those companies do. They make money. They run it through Ireland. Then
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.800]   they bounce it to the Netherlands, down to here and over there, and then they pay 2%, 3%, 4% in
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.040]   the EU. They park it there, or actually, they move it down to the Caribbean and park it there.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   And then as long as it sits there, hey, that's how it works. You can use a much simpler version
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.080]   of that structure to essentially live tax-free. And I think that you're exactly right, Joshua.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.160]   I mean, look, people are in-- they're outraged right now in the United States. All the politicians,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   all the socialists are all shooting their mouths off about how evil it is that Burger King or
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.080]   Walgreens wants to leave the country. Who forced these companies to be there? Who forced any of
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   us to pay a tribute to the mafia merely because we were born within their borders? I mean, if you
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.520]   live in Compton, if you're born in Compton in California and you're in some drug gang's
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.600]   neighborhood, do you have the right to leave and not have to pay them to, quote-unquote,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.560]   "protect you" anymore? Of course you do. But somehow when it comes to countries and governments,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.240]   it's considered unpatriotic to leave, and it's your lifetime obligation to pay,
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.080]   something that you never signed up for. And that's where I say, no. You have the ability
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.880]   and the right to go wherever you want to go where you feel is right for you and play by
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.600]   their set of rules, because one mafia set of rules isn't better than the next.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.640]   It seems so strange to me, because when you actually look at the whole tax debate,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.840]   you have basically two camps that are at least—the two camps that are giving media exposure in our
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.200]   country is, A, people who say, "Listen, everybody should pay their fair share," and fair share is
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.600]   defined as more for the rich, so therefore raising taxes isn't going to hurt revenues,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.680]   and so we should just simply raise taxes and tax everybody and have the services and benefits we
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.600]   need. On the other side, you have people that say, "Listen, everyone's paying too much in taxes. We
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.440]   should lower taxes across the board, and then that will stimulate economic activity." And so depending
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.400]   on where you are in the political cycle, you have this constant battle where people are going back
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.480]   and forth and saying—the people who say, "Hey, listen, lower tax rates. That'll stimulate economic
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.720]   activity." The other people saying, "No, it doesn't work. Trickle down doesn't work." But then what
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.320]   happens is that everyone seems to acknowledge that it works when it's politically convenient.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:06.720]   So that means that if your municipality is run by a very confiscatory person, a left-leaning person
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.000]   who says, "We're going to get the money," well, as soon as we have an opportunity to attract a
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.920]   major sports team, then the first thing that we do is we say, "Well, we're going to give you a tax
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.400]   holiday. We're going to waive these taxes to attract the sports team." Or you have, what was
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.240]   it, Obama with the, "Well, we need to stimulate the economy, so we're going to lower employment
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:30.080]   taxes. So we're going to drop the Social Security tax rate by two points for individuals, and that's
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.800]   going to stimulate." And so you look at it and you say, everyone is lying through their teeth,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.520]   and it's almost like there's an entirely false argument where everyone acknowledges that a
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.360]   complete laissez-faire trickle-down theory, yes, it certainly has perhaps problems. There are
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   certainly things that need to be accounted for, and it's not quite as simple as the people who
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.480]   espouse that theory would say. But on the other hand, everyone, when you need growth, everyone
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.800]   agrees that, "Well, we've got to cut taxes." I don't understand why we don't just simply
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.080]   transform the entire system. And one of the things I'm most excited about is the news that
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.680]   the corporate inversions are getting right now, like you said, with Burger Kings, with Walgreens,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:16.320]   because this is another one that is so blindingly obvious, is that there is so much money on the
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.120]   large U.S. corporate balance sheets that just sits abroad. And unless there's another
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.880]   repatriation holiday, the money just sits abroad, and they never bring it back to the U.S.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.520]   So I don't understand why—I mean, I do understand. It's called politics, and it's called
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   promises, and it's called perception. But it just seems—I scratch my head at it, and I throw up my
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:43.760]   hand and say, "I can't fix the system, but I can fix my situation, and I don't have to participate,
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:50.960]   and I can simply choose to live the good life, and I'm not interested in supporting an empire.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.640]   It doesn't work for me." Look, you're exactly right. And the question is,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.680]   who owns you? Are we sovereign individuals? Should we have the right to do as we please,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:07.040]   provided that we're not hurting other people? Or are we supposed to be the tax slaves of
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.240]   these mafias that draw stripes in the sand and say, "This is our territory"?
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:16.720]   And so, I mean, you made a very good point. I was talking to some people who moved here from France
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.000]   yesterday, and they were talking about how there's not very many small businesses there,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.840]   there's not very much entrepreneurship there. And why would there be? Because to start up a
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.120]   business, you have to pay a gazillion dollars in taxes, registration fees, go through a Byzantine
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.520]   approval process with every regulatory agency, with obnoxious bureaucrats who weigh you down
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.480]   the entire way. Then you hire people, and you can't fire them in most circumstances.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.800]   You have to prepay salaries. You have to pay, if you're successful, if you manage to go through
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.080]   all that and have a business that people want, and you can find anyone in France with two shekels
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.200]   left to pay you to buy your product because they haven't been taxed into oblivion, then for the
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.960]   privilege of you creating jobs and a successful business, you get to pay 75% of your income at
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.240]   the high levels. And so, gee, I wonder why there are no businesses there. But let's put that aside,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.360]   Josh. I mean, sure, that's why there's not entrepreneurship in France, and there is
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:19.200]   entrepreneurship in Singapore. But at the end of the day, who cares? Whose right is it to take
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.720]   your money? If the principle of slavery is that someone comes and forces you to work for them
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.520]   and takes 100% of what you earn, then does that mean that we're half slaves if we're giving the
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:38.560]   government 50% of our money? You're exactly right. You don't owe it to anybody to contribute your
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.400]   wealth. Now, I guess you can do the going galt route, and you can say, hey, I'm just going to
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.440]   stop producing. I believe that's also economically immoral. You have the obligation to do the best
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:53.360]   for yourself. So if you're capable of producing, you should not just stop and say, I'm just going
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.480]   to live under a bridge somewhere. You should go somewhere where you can do what you want to do,
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.040]   do what you were meant to do, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. And there's nothing wrong with that
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.560]   whatsoever. And of course, these politicians have a big problem with it, because they're on the other
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.640]   end. And guess what? As you mentioned, yes, they take the money and they give it to their cronies.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.160]   You, the business guy, who has no political connections, is getting screwed against the wall.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.600]   But meanwhile, the guy who owns the big sports team, the guy with all the money that they claim
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:32.480]   to hate, the evil rich guy, he's getting kickbacks from his crony politicians because they're in bed
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:39.200]   together. There's a word for that, Joshua. It's called fascism. Hard to admit, though, right?
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:47.440]   Land of the free and home of the brave. I would say with all of these things, it strikes people,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.240]   even just when it comes to whether taxation or all these things, at least for me, my personal path,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:02.960]   I'm not quite as prone to...I think a lot. I don't necessarily get upset about a lot of things,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:10.000]   I just think. But the interesting thing is that I feel like I have been so conditioned that,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.880]   just simply growing up in the US American culture, I feel like I've been so conditioned that even to
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.000]   ask questions, people jump on you. So it's interesting. When I ask questions about the
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.440]   history of education, the history of tax policy, the history of government, when I ask questions
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.280]   about the history of the big ideas, concepts like patriotism, where did this whole idea of
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.760]   patriotism come from? What does it mean? I just start thinking through it. What happens is that
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.800]   in most conversations, our knee-jerk reaction, or at least what I've experienced is that most
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:48.960]   people's knee-jerk reaction is to simply say, "Well, just to jump on you instead of engaging
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   with the idea." And it's really remarkable to me because you start asking questions and you just
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:04.720]   simply say, "Well, why does this exist? Why do I give over this authority?" And like I said,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.880]   you just get people to immediately jump on it instead of stopping and saying, "Oh, wait a
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.240]   second. Why do we do things that way? Why don't I just simply choose to do what's in my best interest?"
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.640]   >> Again, I love these countries that have overcome adversity. And it's unfortunate what
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.240]   some of these people have gone through. I mean, you go to Cambodia, it's very heartbreaking what
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   they've gone through. But I think that a good reset every once in a while is important in a
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:35.280]   culture for people to be reminded of why things are the way they are. I talk frequently about
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.800]   the idea that the United States is the Paris Hilton of countries or the socialite of countries
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.600]   where they're kind of rich, not as rich as they think they are, but they're relatively wealthy,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.320]   but they don't know why. And so what they do is they dump on everything that made them wealthy
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.000]   in the first place. I mean, go back 101 years in the United States, no income tax. Somehow,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.400]   there were roads, there was a post office, people were going to school, things were being invented.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.480]   I mean, how long ago was it that they said, "Let's shut down the patent office because we've
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.400]   invented everything that could possibly ever be invented." Somehow, all of that was done with
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:15.520]   no income tax. People were left alone. But everyone got away from that. They forgot about
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.360]   that. And you're right. When you mention now the concept that, "Hey, maybe this place is going
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:28.240]   in the tubes," even the people who agree with you, "Yeah, we've got our problems," but they'll say,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.000]   "It's still the best country on earth." It's such an egotistical thing. Now, if you want to be
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   egotistical and you want to suck off the government doll and have your job and have two cents left
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.600]   over at the end of every paycheck and be a drone, that's one thing. It's a great system for you.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.000]   But imagine the odds. I mean, the ego these people have to think that out of 194 countries,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.960]   they just so happened to be born in the best one. I mean, isn't that fascinating that you,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.360]   of all people, were born in the best country? Do you think maybe it's because it's the only
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:09.440]   country that you know? No, of course not. Are these people doing empirical data?
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.520]   Are they studying? Like, "Hey, look at this number." No. It's emotional. It's nothing but
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.040]   emotional. Well, you see the same thing in the United States. I mean, the amazing thing about
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:28.800]   the United States or Canada or Europe is that—well, Europe is not a good example—but Canada, U.S.,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.680]   Australia, large China, large individual countries where there's a huge land mass all under one flag
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   is that you can live easily, easily move anywhere from anywhere in the United States to anywhere in
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.040]   the United States with the minimum of fuss. The only upset to your situation is going to be your
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.120]   social structure, your circle of contacts and the people that you are with. But if you don't like
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.040]   the city, you can easily move to the country. If you don't like the heat, you can easily move north.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:03.680]   If you don't like the humidity, you can move west. But yet, how many people actually are willing to
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.840]   sit down and say, "Ah, the small town where I grew up or the big city where I grew up, what I'm
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:14.320]   familiar with might not be the best, and it might be simply easier just simply to move and save a
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.360]   ton. Why don't I move out of Chicago and move to Texas? Or why don't I move out of Chicago, and if
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.520]   I want to keep the same climate, move west or move east or move to somewhere else where I can get
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.600]   treated a little bit better but retain the things that are important to me?" We usually don't start
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.840]   with this comprehensive planning idea. Rather, we just simply stay stuck with what we know.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:41.760]   I've been interviewed on a lot of shows like yours, both the political side and the business
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.840]   entrepreneurial side. When people say, "Well, what's your advice to the average person listening?"
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.680]   I can't motivate people. I can't force you to make a change in your life. The answer is,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.440]   you just have to do it. Everyone has an excuse. "Oh, I got four kids. Oh, my parents live here. Oh,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:04.000]   well, in three" – whatever it is, do you want to be free or do you not? Look, I'm a pragmatic guy.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.960]   I'm willing to make a few compromises for the point of enjoying my own life or whatever the
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.200]   case may be. But you talk about these big countries. I'd love to be from a small country.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:23.920]   I mean imagine if you were a citizen of Uruguay or something. Do you think that the IRS of Uruguay
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.040]   – and I'm not encouraging people to break the law because the laws in most of these countries
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   are much more favorable than where you're from. But do you think that the IRS of Uruguay is chasing
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   people around the world? "Hey, you don't have a bank account in Singapore, do you? You better tell
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:42.160]   us. You better pay us. You better give us our cut." No. I mean being from small countries in
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.800]   many cases is much, much, much better because again the smaller countries are more responsive
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:53.600]   to people's needs. I mean you can't do this as an American anymore. But for years places like
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.720]   Liechtenstein and Dora were the best places for people to bank because those places had nothing
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.840]   to offer but banking. So they became the best at banking. Imagine if you were from a place like
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.400]   that. Imagine if you banked in a place like that. Imagine if you had a website in a place like that.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.200]   To protect your privacy, stuff like that. I mean it's oftentimes the smallest countries that offer
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.120]   the best advantages to people because they understand they don't have a choice. They
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.200]   have to treat you well. Countries like the US, Russia, Brazil, I mean places like this,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:33.120]   they have hundreds of millions of tax slaves. They don't – I mean they have to be competitive to a
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.000]   certain extent but they can also just milk the system to a certain extent and just suck off
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.800]   the fruits of all their citizens' labor. And as long as they can keep their citizens in the
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.120]   blissful ignorance of thinking that rah, rah America, let's pay our money to the government
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.440]   because if we didn't we would just be like those savages in Singapore where they're living in mud
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:04.960]   huts and walking down streets of dirt and all kinds of horrible – tigers are attacking them.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:12.720]   Imagine if we didn't pay taxes, we'd be like those people, those uncivilized hunks. But that's
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.120]   what they try and convince you to do and that's why some of these smaller countries are oftentimes
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.200]   better. That's why the smaller countries like the Caribbean, what have you, are the ones leading the
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.520]   stuff that I talk about. Why did you choose Asia?
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:33.440]   I've been all over. And personally I think that Latin America, South America, there are a lot of
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:40.240]   great opportunities there. I happen to be very impatient and there's nothing better to me than
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.920]   flying into Hong Kong airport, getting off that plane, going into like the 7-Eleven and you're
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.360]   in and out of that cash register in three seconds. I mean it's just hurry, hurry, hurry, rush,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   rush, rush. I love that. I love the efficiency of it. I'm an efficiency guy which for me the
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.760]   Latin world is a bit too slow. But witnessing what's happening right now in Asia is amazing
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.480]   and I would feel like I was missing out if I wasn't being a part of this transformation because
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.280]   I really think it is one of the most significant economic transformations in modern history.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.760]   What's happening right now in Asia and especially here in Southeast Asia where you've got
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.040]   people in China going from lower class to middle class. You've got 40,000
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:26.480]   millionaires being created all the time in China. You've got places like Cambodia where again,
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.320]   I mean 40 years ago the place was an agrarian utopia so they said which was as we know,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.800]   government uses code word. That was code word for take everyone into the bush and shoot them.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.560]   And look at what they're at now. I mean they're slowly and steadily growing and becoming wealthier
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.440]   and wealthier. Now they're buying cars. People who have motorbikes are moving up to cars. People
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.000]   who are walking with the motorbikes. There's so much happening here. There's so much opportunity.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:37:00.080]   I love being a part of it and on top of that it's a fantastic place to live because you can live a
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.360]   New York City lifestyle in cities like Kuala Lumpur for a fraction of the New York City price.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.560]   You get left alone. The governments here aren't perfect but you can live the kind of lifestyle
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:19.200]   that I talk about where you're not really on the radar. You're here as kind of a visitor and
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.680]   you can have a lot of freedom that way. Do you have to have an online business or do you
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.080]   see opportunities for people to set up local businesses that are bricks and mortar type of
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.520]   operations? I'm a big fan of bricks and mortar. I'm not really the biggest advocate of online. I
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.920]   mean obviously I think it's a great model for those who want to do that but I think that you
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   can absolutely do more than that. I mean before I even realized it, I had a location independent
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.080]   business when I was very young. I ran a broadcasting business where we helped radio
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:57.600]   stations sell their unsold inventory and it became a rather influential company in its industry before
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.360]   I exited that company. But once I got that off the ground, I would be traveling in Vienna and
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.440]   making phone calls at night and night to guys in Chicago where it was two in the afternoon.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.000]   So if you have a consulting business, if you have things where you sell products to other businesses,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.720]   if you're doing import and export, you can absolutely run that location independent.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.120]   It doesn't have to be based online and I think there are a lot of very successful online businesses
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.720]   that are merely using the online aspect or the app aspect as a conduit, i.e. Uber,
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:33.040]   Airbnb. Those services all deal in physical product, physical deliverables but they're using
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.120]   the online model to facilitate that. But I do think there are also a lot of opportunities. I
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:46.480]   mean I've talked at length about Cambodia. Columbia is another place I think where you can go and
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.680]   start a business and be very successful. It depends on how far down the totem pole you're
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.160]   willing to go. I mean Laos is a place where people are clamoring for pretty much everything you can
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.880]   possibly imagine because it's either not available there or it's super duper expensive and anyone who
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.400]   wants it flies to Thailand. That's just one example. There are countries like that all around
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.160]   the world where you can go in and say, "Listen, I'm going to deliver jeans to people's houses on
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.120]   a motorbike and that's my business." I think there are a lot of brick and mortar opportunities.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:30.160]   Again, the further undeveloped you go, Laos, Africa, Myanmar, places in South America like
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.360]   Paraguay. I mean the less developed, the more opportunity, the more money that can be made.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:42.640]   Mongolia was one of them at one point. But there are places that are a little bit more developed.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:49.120]   Cambodia really doesn't seem very adventurous to me anymore. Places like Chile, Panama,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.000]   there's still plenty of money being made there. I talk to guys every day who are members of my
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.760]   private club who come to my events. Some of them are doubling their money every year. They're
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.640]   starting businesses and selling them for 10, 20 times a couple of years later. I mean there's so
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.360]   much money being made outside of the US and it's so much easier to get started because you're not
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.960]   paying the higher rent in San Francisco. You're not hiring people for 60 grand a year.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:19.280]   I'm glad you brought up the point about like you alluded to it more but I'd like to just
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.400]   emphasize it. Online businesses, I think, online business is in many ways becoming
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:32.560]   maybe a misnomer. It seems to me that in the past people would think about online as, "Oh,
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.680]   it's a separate thing." And now if your business doesn't have a strategy, online is just simply
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.280]   becoming in some ways just a communications medium. And so I think there are many, many more
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.120]   types of businesses that can be pursued, that can be run virtually that aren't traditional virtual
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.400]   businesses. The earliest example that I thought of, that I can remember personally coming across
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.720]   is I knew somebody, I think I met them eight or nine years ago, and this person was an attorney
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:04.960]   in Chicago and a corporate attorney so mainly involved with documents and mergers and dealing
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.400]   with all the paperwork, appropriate paperwork for on the corporate side. No litigation and nothing
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:16.880]   like that. And this attorney was doing well and he enjoyed spending time down in Mexico. Well,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:24.080]   he wound up--he committed some crime of some kind and he could--he basically can't come back to the
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.400]   U.S. If he comes back to the U.S., he's got to deal with this crime. It's a fairly minor crime.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.000]   I think it was a non-violent, some stupid drug crime or something like that. And he--all what
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.440]   he chose to do is this was back when, what was that, Vonage was brand new and he just got a
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:46.880]   Vonage phone number for Chicago area code, got a decent access internet connection, and he
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.840]   continued to simply run his entire law practice just simply from Mexico, working with the Chicago
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   clients. They didn't care if whether they saw him or not. They just needed the documents to be right.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.200]   And he's able to do the entire thing from abroad and multiply the effect of his income because of
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.040]   living abroad, spend less time at work, and have a better lifestyle. And even in the six years that
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.240]   I was doing financial planning, working with clients, I noticed a--and this was from 2008 to
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:20.320]   2014. I noticed a dramatic change in people's comfort level with virtual connection. When I
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.360]   started working as a financial advisor, A, the technology was still a little bit clunky and you
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.000]   needed to do in-person meetings. You needed to establish rapport. You needed to have that
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.120]   face-to-face connection. I switched to where in 2013, I almost never left my office. And I preferred,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.840]   as long as a client had some connection with me previously, I preferred to never meet in person.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:47.280]   And they preferred it because our lives are so busy, so hectic, and so it was easier for them
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.080]   to schedule an hour, sit in front of the computer, do an online meeting, and a phone presentation,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.320]   and it was actually more effective than being together in person. Well, there's no reason why
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.240]   I can't do that from the Cayman Islands. There's no reason why I can't do that from anywhere in
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.880]   the world. And everything, it seems, is going that direction more and more, with the exception
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.000]   of something where you need a physical service provided or a physical--yeah, a physical service.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.800]   And even that, there are ways to improve that process with the virtual environment. I mean,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.000]   it just opens up a world of possibilities for any attorney, any CPA, any financial advisor,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.760]   things like that, as long as you can deal with the regulation. And that's what always happens,
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.040]   is the regulation gets in your way. But smart people have been getting around regulation since
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.440]   regulators first started making it. And that's the point. Of course, that's the point. I mean,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   right. I mean, just get rid of the whole bunch of it, nothing would change. But you make a very
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.360]   interesting point. Listen, there are always going to be guys who they want to move to
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.280]   Cambodia and they want to spend five grand or open a bar on the beach. The good news is you
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.040]   can do that there. And when you ask people, "What about minimum wage? What about regulations? What
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.080]   about permits?" Huh? So, I mean, that aspect is easier if that's the kind of life you want to
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.440]   lead. But let's be honest. I mean, you have to have the confidence to say, "Here's who I'm
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   targeting," and not be everything to everybody. In my business, in Nomad Capitalist, we do have
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.120]   some guys in my club called the Nomad Society that run eight and nine-figure businesses all
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.400]   around the world. But that's not really my target market. I'm glad they have them. They contribute
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.760]   a lot. I mean, the members get a lot of value from them. But the reality is I'm someone who's
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.480]   trying to reach out to the digital nomad, the younger guys, the entrepreneurs, people who have
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.960]   half a million dollars, a million dollars, and they need to protect it and they need to grow it.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:41.440]   That's my niche. So if you're the family office, look, I practically flunked out of a party school,
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.280]   please. I mean, no family office wants me advising them. They want guys with better
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.240]   pedigrees than I have. So I have the confidence to say, "Hey, here's my market." And that's what
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.920]   you can do too. There are, I mean, how many guys out there, how many people like me who are
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.800]   entrepreneurs living all around the world here in Asia, in Bangkok, in Vietnam, all over, need help
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.440]   with their taxes? To them, it's a commodity. They just need someone who knows it. If you set up a
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.600]   website and say, "Hey, listen, I got the gold, the silver, and the platinum package. Pick which one
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.880]   you want. Send me your documents. Scan them. I'll review them and I'll send it back to you." I mean,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.840]   what do they care? You just have to have the confidence to say, "That's my market. I'm going
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:26.400]   to be the guy for that group of people." And in a world of essentially 7 billion people,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.600]   when you're essentially opened up over the coming decades, granted many billions of those don't yet
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.680]   have internet connection and many billions of them are going to speak other languages, but
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.280]   in a world of 7 billion, if you only need one in a million to be your client, you have a huge
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:47.520]   marketplace and you really can specialize. And when you take instead of the search function,
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:54.800]   I went out to my driveway yesterday and somebody had dropped off the local yellow pages,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.920]   but they hadn't tied the bag well and it rained. And so the thing was soaking wet anyway. And so
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.760]   it made the decision easier instead of thinking for a moment, "Oh, maybe I should keep this thing,"
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   which I have never used. It made the decision easier to simply toss it right in the recycling
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.440]   bin and it didn't even go into my house. So… How did you find me then, Joshua?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:21.520]   Exactly. I mean, your marketplace with a few keywords and some expertise and then building
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:28.800]   it up, you really can build a huge, huge attraction marketing for anything that you're doing. It's an
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:36.240]   amazing world we live in. And again, I mean, listen, if you're the guy who is the buy here,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:41.680]   pay here car lot or the ambulance chaser targeting the Hispanic community, like maybe you need a
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.840]   physical presence. Although I do think that some of those companies are going to be innovated
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.360]   in the same way that every other industry has seen innovation. And there'll be someone who comes in
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.880]   and says, "We're the ambulance chaser. You don't even have to come in and see. We'll just handle
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.520]   your case remotely." So I think that'll happen. But there's so many opportunities to also just be
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.360]   the kind of me too and run businesses. And again, I mean, I just flew the other day. I try and avoid
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   them because I like to fly a little bit more class. I'm kind of a snob in that way. But I flew back to
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:21.520]   Kuala Lumpur from Japan the other day on AirAsia. It cost me 83 bucks for a seven-hour flight. I
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.800]   mean, think of how far away these two places are. Eighty-three bucks. What's one of the secrets that
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:34.240]   AirAsia uses to keep its fares amazingly low? One of the secrets is they're incorporated in
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:40.480]   Labuan, which is the low-tax hub here in Malaysia, where you can basically cap out your entire
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:46.080]   company's tax at about $6,000 a year. Now, if you're running a very small online business,
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.960]   that's $6,000 too much in many cases. But nevertheless, imagine the advantage that
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:58.160]   AirAsia now has against United Airlines, which flies from Japan to Singapore, who has to pay
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.280]   U.S. tax and deal with all the regulations and have U.S. flight crew and seniority and labor
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.120]   unions. Who do you think is going to win? I mean, if you had to choose which airline you wanted to
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:12.880]   fly in, forget about the fact that AirAsia has 23-year-olds in tight red skirts and United has
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:20.000]   women who are 63 years old and barking at you with a megaphone. Forget that. Who's going to pay five
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   times the price to pay for United's obligations to labor unions and big government? I certainly
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.640]   am not. And the market is saying that because United and other American carriers are retreating
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.680]   from this market largely. They may be flying more flights from San Francisco to new cities,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.200]   but they're not flying any of their older routes largely from point to point within Asia,
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.400]   because they can't compete, because they have this burden. And so, I mean, if you're a guy who says,
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.480]   "Listen, I see an opportunity for something that's already being done well by another business,
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.560]   but they're based in San Francisco. They're hiring guys for 100 grand a year. They're paying
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:05.760]   California taxes," which I call brutal prison rape. I mean, you can come in and just by the
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:12.640]   virtue of setting up shop in Labuan, for instance, you can shave 30 percent off right off the top,
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:18.080]   probably more. Right. And for anybody who's never flown a non-U.S. airline,
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.800]   once you fly a non-U.S. airline, you will never ever want to fly a U.S.-based airline again.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.360]   I was on a low-cost carrier flying from Hong Kong to Vietnam last year,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:34.640]   an hour and 45-minute flight. I got two meals. And they're like, "Oh, can we get you anything
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.720]   else, Mr. Henderson?" I mean, the service is amazing. And then you get into Turkish Airlines,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.560]   Singapore Airlines. I was in the Istanbul lounge waiting for a business class flight,
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.160]   the guys playing a piano next to the brick oven cooking pizzas.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:55.040]   That's amazing. I'm going to give you one of my projects, and I'm interested to hear where you
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:01.680]   would go with it. I think a lot about the idea of how to get a world-class education. And I do not
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:08.240]   care about certification. I care about education. If you were to design an international MBA
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:16.080]   project, and this is an entirely self-designed education in international business, and I'm
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:22.400]   going to give you a $60,000 budget, and you can have anywhere from two to four years,
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.720]   and if you need to stretch the budget a little bit beyond that. We're going to take care of all
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   of the academic knowledge with books and actually spending our some time reading and learning.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.040]   If you were going to go back and, knowing what you now know, encourage someone on how to develop
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.440]   a knowledge of international business, what course of study, where would you encourage
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:47.760]   them to go? How would you approach that project? Again, remember you're talking to a guy who at 18
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:54.000]   years old said, "I slept through much of high school. I should have done much better, but now
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.840]   my grades are such that I can either go and start a business right now, or I can go and hang out
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:06.800]   with girls who wear shorts with one-inch seams, and that's why they moved to Arizona. I'm the
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:13.280]   guy who flunked out of that school practically. International MBA, I'm like a scrappy entrepreneur,
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:18.640]   Joshua. I don't design a program. How your brain works.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:25.680]   Here's what I tell people all the time when they say, "Well, what should I do to find an
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   opportunity?" Let me tell you. I was just meeting with about a dozen guys who were in my club in
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.360]   Hong Kong last week. I came out of there with a dozen different business ideas. I was in Cambodia
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.760]   for a week last month, and I probably had a dozen different business ideas that could all probably
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:48.080]   be pretty successful. When people say, "Well, what should I do?" 60 grand. What is this? Donald
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.840]   Trump overlanding helicopters in the top of buildings, Joshua, please. Save up five grand.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:59.440]   How badly do you want it? Go and live in—I mean, save up three grand. Go and live in a place with
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.960]   no hot water if that's what it takes, and just live and move through some of these emerging
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.320]   economies. You won't need two to four years. You might need two to four months. You might need a
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:18.000]   year. Obviously, not every venture is successful. For me, I'm all about results. That's all that
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.880]   matters to me. I went to the school of press one for sales because sales matters more than
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:30.720]   everything else. If you don't sell, you can't do anything else. My MBA program is get on a plane,
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:37.840]   do whatever it takes, live as cheaply as you have to to make it happen, and figure out where do you
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.360]   want to focus. Do you want to focus in Asia? Do you want to focus in Latin America? Do you want
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:50.080]   to focus in Africa? What is it that you want to do? You go there, and you just kind of—it
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.800]   sounds like management by walking around, but it's kind of like learning through osmosis. You
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.120]   just kind of sit, and the opportunities just kind of come to you in these places. I mean,
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:08.480]   it's really that easy. From there, I'm all about intuition and instincts. You got to try something.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.160]   You got to get on the ground, try something. Start a bar with $1,000. See what happens. See
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:20.720]   how you can—see how to market. See how to—what different things drive sales more than others.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:27.680]   You'll begin to develop this entrepreneurial intuition to understand what it is that drives
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:33.440]   sales and drives consumer behavior. From then, once you have that, I mean once I developed that,
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.840]   I could be in radio. I could be in home services. I could be in financial services.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.320]   I've started numerous businesses in each of those industries and helped people start other
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.960]   businesses as well because I had that basic intuition that could only be gained not in a
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.920]   classroom, not from books, but from actually being there, doing it, seeing what worked,
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:59.520]   and seeing what smacked me in the face. That's an excellent—I agree with you 100%.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.720]   It's an excellent non-answer.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:08.320]   No, I'm glad you went that way. I see so many times—I see these threads, and you see so many
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.200]   people, not everybody, but so many people. They just go and spend some time traveling.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:18.240]   I read a book in high school called Adventure Capitalist, and this was by Jim Rogers. Jim
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.600]   Rogers made his mark as an investor, and then he sat down, then he went, and he built this ridiculous
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:30.080]   four-wheel drive Mercedes convertible and hooked a trailer to it and then drove around the world
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:36.240]   with his girlfriend and just talked about—in that book, Adventure Capitalist, talked about
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.480]   what he learned from that trip. You're exactly right because we place such a precious—we
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:49.520]   place too little value on experience and too much on book knowledge. I'm a victim of this myself,
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:56.480]   is that a little bit of experience brings a lot more actual knowledge sometimes than all of the
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:02.960]   book learning put together, so it's a good answer. Here's the other thing. Listen, you see this
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.680]   frequently discussed on, for example, the TV show Shark Tank. I enjoy this show. It's becoming too
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   Hollywood, but they talk about the concept that if you don't create a business that sells,
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.520]   you can't help anyone. This speaks to what I talk about in the offshore world. You see these guys
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:21.200]   who come on, and they say, "I'm not willing to manufacture this product in China." They say,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.880]   "Why?" "Because I want people in Lebanon, Tennessee to have jobs." "Well, what if you're
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.960]   priced so uncompetitively that no one wants it and you can't create any jobs?" "Well,
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:37.120]   that's the way it goes." You're an idiot. You have to create wealth. You have to create success
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.560]   before you can enjoy this other stuff. I'm not opposed to book learning, but I think that
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.400]   having accomplished what I've accomplished now, I'm in a much better position to go out and say,
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.560]   "You know what? I'm going to go out, and I'm going to study Buddhism," or "I'm going to go
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:57.680]   and learn from a master tea expert in China about how the tea is steeped and how to enjoy the tea
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.720]   and how over each course of drinking the tea, the flavor changes." Right now, I'm seeking out an
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:07.760]   expert on scotch for when we do an event in Ireland. I'm going to fly over to Scotland.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.320]   There's a lot of book knowledge that I'm interested in learning about how different
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.680]   things in the world work, but for me to go to some program and learn how that stuff works and
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.360]   have it forced down my throat, I don't think it helps anyone. To me, it's really the same thing
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.960]   as saying, "You have to learn philosophy alongside learning business or else you'll never be a
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.840]   successful business person." Total nonsense. Learn what you want to learn. It's the true
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:37.520]   free market of knowledge. I love it. Last question, and then with the last question,
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.040]   I'll give you a chance to mention your site and any resources and things that you would like
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:48.160]   people to know about. The last question is this. The reason I live where I live is because of the
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.000]   social environment that I'm engaged in, and I think that's probably the same for most people.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   What have you learned? Let me not prejudge. It seems to me that you've had to
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.880]   change your social environment as far as who you're spending time with and where you're
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   spending time in order to live the kind of lifestyle that you live. What have been the
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.080]   good things about that? What have been the tough things about that? How have you handled some of
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.360]   that? How would you encourage somebody who is seriously considering making a dramatic change
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.520]   in their lifestyle in order to pursue a more off-the-beaten path, but they're worried about
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.680]   their social environment? It's one of those things that I don't know that I can talk to you about
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.920]   how you should deal with it. You just have to deal with it. I look at, for example, when I was in the
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:42.480]   radio business, the talent side. So many people said, "I would love to be on the radio, but I live
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.160]   here in Los Angeles. How do I get started?" The answer was always the same. You need to move to
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.680]   the middle of nowhere in West Virginia, work at a 500-watt AM radio station broadcasting the
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.480]   agriculture report, and you need to work your way up. Now, with the internet and all that,
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.320]   that's becoming an antiquated model and then we can have a podcast. For years, that was how the
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:07.520]   model worked. Everyone said, "Well, what am I going to do about my friends?" Well, apparently,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:12.960]   you don't want to be on the radio that badly. There's a mantra that I use in my life. It's a
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   great success tip. The people who are successful do things that unsuccessful people aren't willing
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.800]   to do. Do you want to be successful or not? How badly do you want it? So I can't tell you
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:31.920]   that your social life won't change. What I can say is I personally enjoy and I've been able to meet
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.920]   people from all around the world and see so many different cultures and have a greater understanding
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:41.040]   of why things work the way they do. To me, that's much more valuable intelligence because you can
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:46.640]   always make new friends. I mean, you really get to choose where you want to go. I'm a big city guy,
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.800]   so I'm not going to go and live in the rice paddies of Laos like one of my friends does.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.280]   That's the social circle he wants to be in. I want to be with people from all over the world.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:01.520]   I live in Kuala Lumpur. It's a very diverse city. So you can recreate the social structure anywhere.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:07.120]   Obviously, with today's technology, it's not like I've told all my friends, "You're dead to me,"
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:11.280]   and I never speak to them again. I speak to them frequently on things like Skype.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:17.200]   But I mean, the question really boils down to, I mean, do you want to make excuses or do you want
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:24.880]   to take action? Which is more important to you? If living in your town is more important than
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:32.560]   saving money on taxes or seeing the world or marrying a Filipino wife or whatever the case
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:37.680]   may be, then that's your personal decision. Everything has consequences. But I can tell
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.480]   you that I think that the payoff is much better in terms of knowledge, in terms of freedom,
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.920]   in terms of wealth. You just have to decide which of those things is more important to you.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:56.320]   It's certainly easier today to keep contact with people than it was five years ago. It's
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.240]   an amazing world we live in. Andrew, thank you for coming on. Any last words?
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.320]   Mention your websites and feel free to plug anything that you would like to plug,
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.040]   any resources that you have that would be helpful to people who would like to get to
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.240]   know more about you and your work, any products that you have. Feel free to
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.040]   share any of that with the audience. Nomadcapitalist.com, we've got all kinds
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   of daily field reports. We've got, I think, more words than the Bible now in terms of
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.920]   information on how to go offshore, how to get second passports, how to do all the stuff I'm
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:34.800]   talking about, live a more free life. What I'm doing in January of 2015 is I'm putting on my
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:41.280]   second big event. We're doing a live event in Cancun called Passport to Freedom, which is an
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.040]   encore presentation to the first one we did in Las Vegas, where I had Peter Schiff and a lot of
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.760]   other names come together, and it was a great event. We're doing the second event next January
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:58.080]   in Cancun, PassporttoFreedomevent.com. You can get all the details. This is basically the Woodstock
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.560]   of internationalization, where we're going to have 30 guys dealing in foreign real estate,
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.880]   foreign investments, moving your gold overseas, opening offshore bank accounts, second passports,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.280]   second residencies, how to start an online business, how to move your business offshore,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:17.920]   all that and a lot more. Basically, ways to grow and protect your money outside of your borders
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.920]   by using the world as your oyster. We're going to have all those guys together in Cancun.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:28.160]   PassporttoFreedomevent.com is the website for that. It's a very limited 150-seat event,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.800]   because I want everyone to be able to have the chance to interact with the speakers personally
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.240]   and actually take action, not just to come and just to learn everything and then go home and
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.960]   not do it, but to be able to come and actually open an offshore bank account before they even
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:49.280]   get back on the plane. That's going to be a great time. If someone's serious about doing
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.640]   some of this stuff, the networking opportunities are amazing, because we've got so many
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.080]   highly successful guys who are going to be there, and girls too, of course.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.440]   I'd love to see some of your listeners in Cancun.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.200]   That sounds like my kind of event. Who knows? Maybe I'll show up. I would enjoy it.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.160]   I'd love to have you.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.720]   Andrew, thank you for coming on. Keep doing the work that you're doing. Also,
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.560]   I just want to mention you do have a podcast, right? I don't know how regularly you release
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.320]   that show, but if anyone's interested, you do have it as a podcast listener.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.240]   You're available in the podcast directories?
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.160]   We do have a radio show on iTunes and absolutely, the Nomad Capitalist Report. We're putting that
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.880]   out every week now. It's my latest rants and raves on the madness that's going on,
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   but we throw in some good actionable information too. We just talked about, interestingly enough,
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.400]   New York real estate, how CNBC is saying how it's going through the roof,
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.480]   and I called them out on how full of crap they are. That's what we talk about on the show.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.640]   I appreciate you mentioning it.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.360]   Awesome. Thank you for coming on. We appreciate it.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.680]   My pleasure, Joshua.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.240]   Well, I told you it'd be interesting. Hopefully, you found some ideas that will be helpful to you
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:02.640]   in your life. What I'd encourage you to do is not think so much about the specifics of what
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.480]   Andrew and I talked about, but more think about the general ideas. You may not be interested in
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.680]   moving to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I certainly don't plan to move there today, although you never
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.920]   know. But no, it's not on my list right now. So don't worry too much about the specifics,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.560]   but consider for yourself, is there a way that you can implement the ideas in a way that works
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.440]   for you? For some of you, that very well may be moving to Southeast Asia or moving to Central
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.560]   America or moving to an insert place that you want to move to here. For others, maybe it's just
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:42.640]   simply changing states. There's no reason why you have to be in a high-tax state or setting up your
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.400]   own version of flag theory here in the United States, living in a state with no state income
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:56.960]   tax, doing business. You get the idea. Now, the other thing is you've got to figure out what's
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.240]   appropriate to you at this point in time. If you are just getting started, you're not earning a
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.840]   huge amount of money, then maybe this is all unnecessary. You've got to look at the cost versus
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.080]   the benefit. And that cost versus benefit analysis will change over time. So consider what you can
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.960]   implement in your own planning, but don't be scared of some of the ideas. Check out Andrew's
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.840]   stuff. I hope you'll find it interesting and helpful. I know that I enjoy reading and at least
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.960]   just considering some of the information. He's got resources about getting second passports. He's got
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.240]   resources about offshore banking, offshore trusts, setting up offshore companies. Again, depending on
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.800]   where you are in your wealth journey, if you have a higher level of wealth, then that type of
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.680]   resource may be more substantial for you. If you're just getting started, it's probably not worth
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.720]   percent spending time pursuing a second passport, but if it's something that you can fit into your
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.320]   life, feel free. Hope you enjoyed the interview. Thank you so much for being here. Be back with
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:06.000]   you tomorrow.
