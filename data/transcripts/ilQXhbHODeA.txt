[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.080]   - Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing, podcast number 32.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.440]   We're talking taxes today with Phil DeMuth.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.280]   Phil is an investment advisor
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.240]   and the author of nine investment books,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.120]   including "The Overtaxed Investor",
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.880]   "Slash Your Tax Bill" and "Be a Tax Alpha Dog".
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.980]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.540]   and I'm the host of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.140]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.980]   is brought to you by
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.540]   the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.180]   a non-profit organization
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.840]   dedicated to expanding John Bogle's legacy
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.020]   by promoting the principles of successful investing
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.160]   and financial wellbeing through education and community.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.140]   The website is boglecenter.net
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.460]   and your tax-deductible donations are greatly appreciated.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.140]   Today, our special guest is Phil DeMuth.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.660]   Phil is a PhD, an investment advisor,
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.620]   a prolific writer about financial topics,
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.980]   and one of Phil's books is called "The Overtaxed Investor",
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.620]   which he updates frequently.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.500]   John Bogle said, and all Bogle Heads know,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300]   that costs matter.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.740]   And one of the biggest costs in investing is taxes.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.380]   So today we're talking with Phil
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.100]   about strategies for reducing your cost
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100]   by reducing your investment taxes.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.740]   So with no further ado, I am pleased to welcome Phil DeMuth.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.260]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast, Phil.
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.300]   Rick, great to be here.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.780]   Phil, you're a, well, I call you a tax expert
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.220]   because you wrote a book
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.500]   called "The Overtaxed Investor, Slash Your Tax Bill
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.620]   and Be a Tax Alpha Dog".
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.700]   And you update this quite frequently.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.420]   I imagine you're gonna be updating it again
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.460]   with all the different changes to the tax code.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.620]   Why did you write the book
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.420]   and tell us a little bit about it and yourself.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.300]   Well, I wrote the book 'cause I'm an investment advisor
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.280]   and I manage money for clients.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.460]   And what happened is we had a little family business
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.620]   that never made any money,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.780]   but it made my tax form like a phone book.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.740]   I had to file it in six states.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.580]   I had no clue what my taxes were about.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.980]   But once the family business went away,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.300]   I suddenly could see it in its naked form.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.060]   And I saw I was paying all these taxes on dividends
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.780]   and capital gains that I didn't want, I didn't need.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.860]   Holy smokes, what can I do about this?
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.940]   So then I dove into the tax code
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.780]   and tried to find some way to figure it out
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.980]   so I could help myself and help my clients.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.060]   Before we jump into the book,
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.440]   let's make some observations about what's going on
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.460]   about 2020 tax returns.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.020]   Can you give us a quick review?
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.140]   Well, of course, the big news is that we don't have to file
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.820]   our federal tax returns until May 17th.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.140]   So they've given us an extra month and two days.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.660]   Although I think we still have to pay
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.220]   our quarterly estimated taxes,
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.420]   first quarter taxes on April 15th.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.540]   So we can't postpone that.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.740]   Well, Phil, I wanna just go over the major taxes
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.780]   that everyone is liable for first.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.580]   And then we'll get into different phases of people's lives
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.140]   and how different taxes begin to affect us
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.180]   as we go from early in our career to midlife
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.180]   to pre-retirees, retirees,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.060]   and then passing money on to our family members.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.960]   Then we're just gonna talk about federal taxes.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.980]   We start with just the basic income tax.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.820]   Well, it started in 1913,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.060]   and it's been a popular idea
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.700]   with the government ever since.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.180]   And it's gone up quite a bit,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.780]   and it may be about to go up again.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180]   This is probably the largest single tax
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.420]   that most of our listeners will be paying.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.980]   It's a graduated tax,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.900]   and it's basically thought of in terms of buckets.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.900]   So up to a certain level of income,
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.680]   you might not pay any tax because everybody gets
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.360]   a tax deduction to start off.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   And then you fill up the 10% bracket, 12% bracket,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.120]   22% bracket, 24% bracket as your income rises,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.240]   32% bracket, 35% bracket, 37% bracket,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.800]   and it'll probably be going back to a 39.6% bracket.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.120]   So it's just depending on your income level
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.400]   and which thresholds you cross,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   you will be paying each additional tax tier at that level.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   You know, when you're filling out your 1040,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   there are three important lines, right?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.040]   There's your total income line,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.320]   and then you have deductions from that.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   And meaning if you're putting money away
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   into say a retirement plan of some sort or an IRA,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.540]   and this gives you your adjusted gross income.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.440]   And then once you have your adjusted gross income,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.640]   you subtract from that your either itemized deduction
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.280]   or standard deduction generally.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.720]   And this thing gives you your taxable income,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.520]   which would go to the tax tables
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.000]   and figure out how much you owe.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.400]   Is that generally how it works?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.240]   Perfectly said.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.060]   Oh, thank you.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.900]   Perfectly said.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.520]   All right, so that's the income tax.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   I mean, we're all very familiar with it
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.560]   because we pay it every year.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.680]   But in addition to that,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.440]   it gets a little more complicated when you're working
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   or if you have a business where you have to pay FICA,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.440]   which is Federal Insurance Contributions Act,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   which is Social Security and Medicare.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.400]   Now, this gets a little complicated
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.480]   because we all have to pay it.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   If you're working for somebody else,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.360]   you pay half and your employer pays half.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.080]   If you're doing it as a self-employed person,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.880]   of course, you have to pay both sides.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.440]   So could you talk with us a little bit about FICA?
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.840]   Again, it covers Social Security.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.480]   That's about 6.2%.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   Medicare is about another one and a half percent.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   Then it's paid by both you and your employer.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.880]   So basically about 15%, a little bit over that,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   is subtracted.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's a lot of money,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.880]   although you never see it in the bank.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.680]   So you don't feel it's lost quite as keenly as other things.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.760]   And of course, it's become controversial recently
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.160]   because President Biden had proposed
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.840]   to increase the level at which this would be taxed.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   You know, it's taxed up to a certain level now at $142,800.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.520]   And then there would be a gap,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.600]   and then anybody earning over $400,000
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   would have it reinstituted again
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   on all the money above that.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.680]   But the good news is that that's not gonna happen
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.960]   because under the Senate's rules
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.720]   to pass a tax bill under the reconciliation,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.360]   which is what he would have to do
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.720]   'cause the Republicans won't sign on to it,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   you cannot change Social Security in any way.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.320]   So this is not gonna be happening to us.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.200]   So that tax will stay the way it is,
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.760]   even though many other taxes might be going up.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.560]   - We have to pay this tax,
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.720]   either half of it or the whole thing,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.120]   if we're self-employed,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   of approximately 15.3% is what it comes out to,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.960]   up to $142,800 this year.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.800]   And it goes up every year, that number.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.000]   If you look at all the different inflation numbers,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.160]   like how much extra you get in Social Security,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.800]   or me as a military retiree, how much extra I get,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   it seems to creep up by about 1%, 1.5% per year.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.600]   Yet this number seems to creep up faster than that.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.920]   But then it stops for Social Security,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.720]   but it doesn't stop for the 2.9% Medicare tax.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   It just keeps on going.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   In fact, there's another Medicare surtax
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.840]   that kicks in for single people at 200,000
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.040]   and for people filing jointly at 250,000.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.160]   Married filing separately, it actually starts at 125,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.720]   and it's an extra 0.9%.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   This tax is on your wages going forward forever.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.520]   - And that's not adjusted for inflation.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   - And you have the Affordable Care Act, NIIT tax,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.600]   which is 3.8% on capital gains and dividends
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.240]   that starts at the same place,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   also not adjusted for inflation.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.080]   And this is deliberate
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   because they wanted to only catch rich people, so to speak,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.280]   the millionaires and billionaires earning more than 200,000.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.640]   But eventually, with inflation,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.320]   the middle-class incomes will rise,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.760]   and they will also be smeared by this.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.720]   And they did that because they knew
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.660]   that these programs are incredibly underfunded.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.600]   So it's just sort of a backdoor way
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.920]   of trying to get more revenue to keep them afloat.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.840]   - Yeah, let's talk about that net investment income tax
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.400]   because it gets laid on top of any investment income
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.780]   from dividends or capital gains or rent,
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.400]   not municipal bond income, but anything that's taxable,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.960]   it gets laid on top of that.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.240]   So if you have a long-term capital gain
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.520]   and you're paying 15%,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   if your adjusted gross income is above 200,000
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.620]   if you're single or 250,000
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.560]   if you're married, filing jointly,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   this 3.8% tax gets laid upon the 15%.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.080]   And of course, once you have higher capital gains
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.060]   or higher income and you get above 500,000
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.820]   for married, filing jointly,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.580]   now you're at 20% capital gain
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.580]   and you get this 3.8% laid upon that as well.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:05.860]   So I think that people really should be watching then
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.600]   how much dividend, interest, capital gain, and rent
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.880]   they're getting from their taxable portfolios.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   - Yeah, well, plus it's part of the Biden tax plan proposal
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.620]   to bring back the P's limitation on deductions.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.380]   And that is an additional tax
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   of about 1.2% on dividends, capital gains, rent.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.340]   So that really takes for people,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.260]   say earning more than 400,000 married, filing jointly,
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.700]   that's gonna take their capital gains,
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.540]   dividends tax up to 25%.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.100]   - It adds up.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.100]   Let's talk about another tax.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   And this doesn't hit you until you're 65.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.540]   And that is Medicare Part B and Part D,
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.260]   how much you pay for that, which is a backdoor tax.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.100]   - Yes, well, there's a certain base rate
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.820]   that everybody pays.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.600]   But then what happens is at certain levels of income,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.400]   the rate for the Medicare Part B,
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.240]   there are surcharges that are put on that tax.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.400]   If you're married, filing jointly,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.880]   it starts rising at 218,000.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   And then it just keeps stepping up as a number of step ups
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   until finally, if your income is as high as 750,000
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.480]   married, filing jointly,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   the premium is basically two and a half times
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.080]   what it was when you started.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.920]   And the bad part about that is that would be true
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.800]   for both you and for your spouse.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.120]   And that would carry on as long as you have
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.680]   that higher income.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.800]   So potentially this could go all the way through retirement.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.240]   So it adds a lot of dollars to your healthcare expenditure
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.320]   and retirement.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.880]   And nevermind the fact that there's a ton of stuff
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.660]   that you'll need during retirement for healthcare
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.760]   that is not even covered by Medicare.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.320]   So it's not cheap.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.040]   And it's also, of course, still woefully underfunded
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.520]   relative to what Medicare pays for the services
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   it gives you.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.800]   - A lot of the incomes that we're talking about
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.480]   to determine what you pay in Medicare,
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.380]   what you might have to pay for net investment income tax
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.640]   is based on modified adjusted gross income,
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.720]   which has many different meanings in the tax code.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.080]   - We try to get a big picture
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.560]   on how to address our taxes in the tax code.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.720]   And that's great.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.320]   But at the same time, the devil is in the details.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   And taxes is about the 73,000 pages of rules and regulations
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.920]   getting it right, getting all the details correct.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.160]   And these general answers will only carry us so far
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.760]   'cause it's gonna come down to the specifics
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.180]   of everybody's tax situation.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.880]   - Only a portion of your social security is going to be taxed
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   but what portion that is depends again on your income.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.760]   - Right.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.960]   And of course, the great danger here,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.360]   here as elsewhere in the tax code,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.960]   there are discontinuities.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.840]   You expect if you earn a little bit more money,
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.400]   you'll pay a little more tax.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.080]   Little more money than that, you'll pay a little more tax.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.120]   And that might generally be how it works.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.240]   But there are also places, sort of trigger points
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.480]   where you can earn a little bit more money
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.280]   and suddenly your marginal tax rate might go up 100%.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.200]   These places actually exist.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.800]   So that's why you have to be very careful
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.840]   in calculating your taxes.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.040]   And by the way, this is not for millionaires.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.840]   This is people that earn $60,000
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.920]   or show $60,000 of income
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.280]   or people that might show $150,000 in income.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.720]   You have to be very careful.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.120]   At the end of the year, when you figure out your taxes,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.800]   you have to basically just plug in another $100
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.680]   and see what that $100 does to your tax bracket.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   And if it shows it jump exactly
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   what the marginal tax rate says it should jump, you're fine.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.080]   But again, with Social Security,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.960]   it can jump way, way above that.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.640]   So you have to make sure you're not hitting
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.720]   one of these bump zones,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.400]   one of these discontinuities in the tax code.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.240]   Otherwise you're gonna have to maneuver
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.800]   to get around it.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.360]   And this is exactly the kind of thing
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.680]   that your accountant may not even be aware of
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.360]   and may not point out to you.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   So this is something you have to ask the accountant to check
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.280]   or you have to check yourself during your own taxes.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.400]   - Let's do one more tax.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.280]   And this one has always confused me.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.800]   This is the alternative minimum tax.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.240]   This is a completely different methodology
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   for figuring out taxes
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.440]   to ensure that certain people pay enough in taxes.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.520]   - Well, fortunately, I've forgotten a lot of it
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.440]   because under the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.400]   very few people were paying it.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.120]   But prior to that, a lot of people were paying it.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.560]   It started out as a alternative tax system
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.520]   to make sure that rich people were paying their fair share.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.280]   But then what happened is thanks to bracket creep,
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   it suddenly started to ensnare a lot of the middle class
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.040]   and the upper middle class.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.600]   So everybody had to figure out their taxes twice
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.040]   once the IRS way, once the alternative minimum tax way,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.280]   and then pay whichever is more.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.680]   - Well, I'll tell you a story about myself.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.560]   I sold a business and did an installment sale
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.000]   and I did it over three years.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.840]   - Very smart.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.320]   - Well, thanks, except that last year, 2019,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.240]   the big part of the installment came to me.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.600]   And I wasn't subject to the net investment income tax
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.840]   because I own the company and I manage the company,
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.560]   but I did get hit with the alternative minimum tax
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.200]   because the capital gain that I took
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   from the sale of my equity bumped me up to a threshold
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   where when we did the alternative minimum tax,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.280]   I did get hit with that.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.040]   So if you're selling a business,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.600]   you might still see the alternative minimum tax
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.160]   come into play.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.840]   You know, you think you did your taxes right,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.880]   but you skipped over the alternative minimum tax
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.840]   and you send all your information into your CPA
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.920]   and next thing you know, it's like, oh, by the way,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.360]   yeah, it's this extra $10,000 over here
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   that you got to pay.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.640]   Okay, we've been over all of these taxes,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.680]   the income tax, the social security
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.920]   and Medicare tax called FICA.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   We've been over the capital gains taxes
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.360]   and the net investment income tax
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.000]   that you might get hit with.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.560]   We've talked about taxes for Medicare,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.000]   how they can go up based on your income
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   and taxes for social security.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.320]   Oh, and then the net investment income tax.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.840]   We have all these different taxes
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.000]   that we have to look out for
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.240]   and they kind of come in and hit you.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.080]   You know, it's like, zing, boom.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.520]   Oh, I didn't see that one coming.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.680]   Anyway.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.320]   But Rick, you've left out a lot of taxes.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.640]   I mean, there's the federal unemployment tax,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.320]   which is about 6%.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.360]   State unemployment tax.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.440]   You've got your state taxes.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.640]   You've got property taxes.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.200]   You've got licensing taxes on your car.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.440]   You've got excise taxes.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   It's an endless list.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.280]   It's really, it's astonishing.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.320]   You know, when you start adding
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.840]   all the state taxes in there,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.120]   especially if you have your own business
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.960]   and you have employees, it just gets to be crazy.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.160]   I know if you live in some states like California,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.360]   just, you know, the income taxes
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   and state income taxes alone,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.080]   and you're over the 50% tax bracket,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.720]   not even including your property taxes
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.600]   or any of the other taxes that you may have to pay 'em,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.920]   it's a lot of money.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.520]   And we could see a migration in the country
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.040]   out of these high-tax states
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.360]   towards low-tax states or no-tax states
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.480]   just to avoid all of that.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.360]   And, you know, and there's a tax strategy
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.640]   that I talk about with clients.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.600]   Let's say a client who lives in California.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.600]   I might be getting ahead of myself here.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.920]   I say, you know, if you put a lot of money
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.560]   into a retirement plan, like a 401(k) or a 403(b),
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.440]   you don't have to pay income taxes on that,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.880]   federal income tax, or state income tax.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   And then when you retire, if you move out of state,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.560]   you still have to pay the federal income tax
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   when you withdraw that money,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.520]   but you have avoided paying the state income tax.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.280]   And thus far, states have not been able to come after you.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.480]   - Yes, wonderful.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.880]   If you can retire and move to a no-tax state,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.640]   you've done yourself a great favor.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.040]   - Now that we've briefly gone over
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   all the different taxes that you could get hit with,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.240]   we're gonna talk about, at different stages of your life,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.960]   how you can plan, do tax planning,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.840]   and adjust your investments,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.480]   and where you invest and how you invest.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.600]   And you call this the stages of a dog's tax life
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.040]   in your book, "The Overtaxed Investor."
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.360]   Let's go ahead and go through these stages.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.400]   You know, they're trying to,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.200]   but only paying what you're required to pay, you know, by law.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.920]   And so let's start with a young person
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.760]   who graduated from college, or graduated from school,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.840]   is now going out into the world, going to get a job.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.280]   This is all new to them.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.880]   So take us from there.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.240]   - The basic idea is that young people
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   should, that are in low-income brackets,
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.560]   ought to place money in a Roth IRA
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.640]   and let that compound for the rest of their lives
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.600]   till retirement.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.080]   - Well, let's clarify a couple of things.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.200]   First of all, a Roth IRA, the money goes in after tax.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.400]   So there's no current tax break
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.560]   on putting money into a Roth.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.480]   And the idea is you put money in, it grows tax-free,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.760]   and then later on down the road,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.280]   you could take it out tax-free.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.080]   And in fact, if you don't ever use it,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.160]   your children, if you have children,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   or whoever's gonna inherit your money,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.720]   inherits that account tax-free,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.200]   and they have 10 years to take the money out,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.800]   but it's all tax-free.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.480]   So coming out of school, you get your first job.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.120]   You go to your employer.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.840]   Your employer says, "We have a 401(k) or a 403(b),
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.280]   "and you should put money in it."
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.720]   What are the first question you should be asking?
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.240]   - Well, the first question you should be asking,
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.320]   I would say, is do you have an after-tax
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.760]   or a Roth option on this?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.480]   'Cause as a young person with a relatively low income,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.160]   I would want to take advantage of that.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.880]   And the second question, which is equally important,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.560]   is what's the employer match
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.400]   on this contribution that I make?
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   - I agree that if you're not making much money
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.920]   and you're in a low-tax bracket,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.080]   that putting the money in the Roth side of a 401(k)
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.000]   is a smart idea.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.400]   Your employer, by the way, can't do that.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.320]   Your employer has to put their match
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.960]   into a pre-tax 401(k).
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.800]   - Correct.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.200]   - So you're going to get a statement of some sort
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   that shows pre-tax side and after-tax Roth side.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.640]   All right, so now we get married.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.040]   We're going to buy a house.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.120]   We're pregnant.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.360]   We're going to have children.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.000]   And we need to save money for college.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.920]   How do we do that?
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.640]   - The smart way to save money for college these days
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.600]   is through the 529 plan,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.040]   which is a plan where you can put money in.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.680]   You don't get any federal tax benefit for doing it.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.400]   Some states will offer you a tax benefit
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.080]   for using their plan if you're a resident of their state.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   And you can put in $15,000 apiece, husband, wife.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.920]   That could be $30,000.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.600]   And they let you front load the contribution for five years.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   So that's $75,000 apiece or $150,000, if you've got it,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.000]   for both of you.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.160]   Put that in the 529 plan,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.040]   and that covers the five years worth of contributions.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   This money inside the plan compounds as Junior grows up.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.640]   And then when it comes time for college,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.960]   you can take the money out
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.840]   and you can spend it on college tuition
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   and on room and board, books, college expenses, computer.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.480]   And this is a fabulous way to pay for college,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.400]   especially as opposed to the alternative,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.480]   which is either having to pay ordinary income
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.920]   or having to sell stocks, pay capital gains taxes,
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.600]   and then send the tuition checks to college.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.720]   These are sensational vehicles.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.880]   Some people have even used them
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.360]   in ways that were not intended by the original legislation
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   as de facto retirement savings plan for themselves,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.080]   naming themselves as beneficiaries,
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.240]   take the money out,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   paying the penalty for not using it for education.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.760]   Or else they can take the money out
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.680]   and they can take golf lessons at Hilton Head.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.840]   But those are unusual uses.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.440]   The real idea is kids' college education,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.520]   and it's a terrific way to go.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.800]   - You could also use it nowadays
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.200]   to pay for private school up to a certain point.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.480]   - It is, but it's generally less valuable
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.800]   because the point is to have, again,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.360]   a long-term compounding.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   You can fund the plan the day the child is conceived.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.400]   Then you've got a real running start for college.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.880]   And if you have enough money,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.920]   you can then start using it for high school
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.040]   or elementary school or even kindergarten.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.680]   - So I have clients who even go further than that.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.840]   They will fund a 529 in their own name.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.960]   And then when they start having children,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.880]   they will change the beneficiary to the child.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   - And you can do that too.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.840]   And you can also rope grandma and grandpa into this,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.600]   and they can set up plans for the kids.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   - Interesting that you have the grandparents saved
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.560]   because when you do the FAFSA form,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.520]   the money that the parents have counts more
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.080]   towards whether the child gets financial aid
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.000]   than what the grandparents have saved.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   - But then there's also the question of graduate school.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.840]   Because graduate school is not gonna be looking
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.880]   at parent income, 'cause they'll assume
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.080]   your child is an adult.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.000]   - So now that we are working and we have a family,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.680]   we have children, we're saving in a 529,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.320]   at what point do we decide, as we make more money,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.720]   decide that we're not going to do the Roth 401(k) anymore,
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.840]   but we're going to start doing the pre-tax 401(k)?
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   And then since the 401(k) of 403(b)
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.680]   isn't being fully utilized,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.120]   we start doing what's called a mega backdoor Roth.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.320]   Can we get into those?
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.360]   - Sure.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.560]   Well, the question about, should I put money in a Roth,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.040]   or should I put it in a traditional 401(k),
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   403(b), IRA, is a one variable problem.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.120]   All you need to know is this.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.800]   Am I paying more taxes now,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.560]   or will I be paying taxes at a higher rate
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.300]   when I pull the money out?
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.000]   You know what you're going to be paying this year in taxes.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.080]   You don't know what you're going to be paying
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.720]   after year 72, or whenever you're going to have to start
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.080]   pulling the money out.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.760]   But at that rate, you're going to have to estimate
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.140]   what your tax bracket is going to look like.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.560]   And if it looks like your tax bracket is higher today
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.960]   than it is then, which it is for most people,
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.160]   most people are earning more in midlife,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.200]   and they're going to be earning less in retirement.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.020]   And so it's the smart move for most people
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.580]   is to put money in a traditional plan.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.060]   You want to pay the taxes when your taxes are lower.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.780]   - I want to talk about what's called a mega-backdoor Roth,
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.020]   because I find it's very useful.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.620]   And here is where you have a 401(k) or a 403(b),
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.460]   where you're putting in the maximum.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.860]   And if you're below the age of 50,
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.220]   the maximum this year is 19,500.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.900]   That's what you can put in.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.180]   Once you get over 50, it goes up to 26,000.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.180]   But your employer on the other side puts money in also,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.420]   and that's the match, or sometimes the profit sharing.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.660]   And for people under the age of 50,
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.780]   the maximum this year is 58,000,
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.340]   and that includes your 19,500
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.040]   plus what the employer puts in.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.300]   So if it's not being utilized,
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.220]   let's say the employer, you're putting in 19,500,
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.480]   and the employer is putting in 10,000,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.100]   I'll call it 10,500 to make a nice round number.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.180]   So they're putting in total of 30,000 is going in,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.820]   but a total of 58,000 could be going in.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.820]   It's $28,000 worth of that 401(k) or 403(b)
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.820]   that is not being utilized.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.760]   It is, it's a window of opportunity that is not being used.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   And you could do, maybe, depending on the plan document,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.460]   could do what's called a mega backdoor Roth.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.860]   If you have the capacity to put money into a 401(k)
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.860]   or a 403(b) in excess of the 19,500,
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.580]   and the plan document allows you
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.940]   to put that money in after tax,
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.700]   and then the plan document allows you
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.380]   to do what's called an in-service distribution,
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.180]   which means nothing more than you're continuing
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.080]   to work there, but you can take this money out
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.940]   and put it into a Roth account.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.920]   So those two things, you can put money in after tax,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.220]   and then you could take that money out
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.060]   and roll it over to a Roth after tax.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.820]   You could potentially, in my scenario,
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.900]   where you're putting in 19,500
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.300]   and the employer's putting in 10,500 and that leaves 28,000,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.700]   if you have the ability to do it,
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.900]   you could potentially put $28,000 a year
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.860]   into your Roth account using this mega backdoor Roth.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.680]   - It's a fabulous strategy.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.220]   - If you have the funds available to do that,
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.580]   that's a great way to go.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.160]   And even if your employer won't let you
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.340]   roll the money out immediately,
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.500]   it's not the employer, if the plan documents
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.620]   don't let you roll it out immediately,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.860]   even if you have to wait 'til you retire to roll it out,
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.020]   that's fine, especially assuming you've got
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.060]   some decent investment options inside the 401(k),
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.620]   which increasingly you do.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.140]   And if you have the kind of plan
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.540]   that allows this kind of sophisticated strategy,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.560]   you probably also have pretty good
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.400]   investment options within the plan.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.920]   So it's a great move.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.640]   And one of the few nice moves available
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.080]   to higher income people.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.360]   So they should definitely take advantage of it.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.200]   - One more concept for the midlife accumulators
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.120]   is this idea of asset location.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.760]   If you've decided that you wanna have
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.520]   some bonds in your portfolio, where do they go?
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.640]   If you wanna have stocks in your portfolio,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.680]   where do they go?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.200]   Can you address that?
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.140]   - Well, this has been thrashed around
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.860]   in the financial planning community forever.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.620]   And the answer seems to be this, the short answer.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.620]   Stocks go in taxable accounts, bonds go in qualified plans.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.180]   Now, there could be some exceptions to this.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.540]   For example, with municipal bonds,
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.020]   you might wanna put those, you would put those
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.980]   typically in a taxable account.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.880]   And if you have other more tax intensive assets,
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.120]   such as real estate investment trusts, commodities,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   you would wanna put those in a qualified plan.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.720]   That's the general picture.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.940]   - What about the idea of putting growth stocks
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.660]   in a taxable account and putting high dividend paying stocks
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.080]   in a Roth or a tax deferred account?
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.240]   - A great idea, I think that dividend stocks
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   are very tricky because people love dividend stocks,
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.840]   but they have to understand that a dividend
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   is basically a capital gain with a zero cost basis,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.580]   the worst kind you can have.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.420]   So I've come to love dividend stocks a lot less
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.040]   unless they're in retirement accounts.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.620]   I love dividend stocks in retirement accounts.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.420]   And just as you say, I much prefer growth stocks
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.740]   that don't pay a dividend or pay very low dividends
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.540]   in taxable accounts, that's great advice.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.260]   - I wanna get into another issue,
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.940]   and this doesn't have anything to do
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.180]   with saving for retirement,
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.980]   but it has to do with buying a house
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.420]   and whether you should take out a mortgage
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.180]   or whether you should make a big down payment.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.400]   And I wanna tie that into the standard deduction
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.740]   that we have nowadays.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.720]   What do you think about when you're talking with clients
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.040]   who may have the ability to pay cash,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.520]   maybe they had some RSUs, restricted stock
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.780]   from a company that they sold,
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.820]   and they have a lot of after-tax cash,
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.980]   and they're thinking about using that
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.100]   to pay off their mortgage or buying a home
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.740]   without a mortgage, what's the formula
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.820]   that we're using these days?
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.340]   - Well, I may be doing something perverse, I don't know.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.460]   I tell clients, and we're talking about people
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.700]   in their 50s, 60s, that I encourage them
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.340]   to take as big a mortgage as they can get
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.020]   as they approach retirement.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.840]   But this is not for tax reasons
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.300]   because they're not gonna get,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.460]   of course, this will change under President Biden.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.740]   Currently, most of them are not able
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.920]   to use the itemized deductions.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.300]   They won't get a big mortgage deduction for it.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.860]   The reason I like it is because a mortgage
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.260]   is a inflation-sensitive asset.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.420]   So if you conceive of inflation
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.740]   as being the number one enemy of a retiree,
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.740]   this is a great way to have a lot of,
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.960]   to have a sort of defensive position.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.180]   Your mortgage will decrease with inflation
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.860]   while other assets on the other side of the ledger
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.700]   will be decreasing as well.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.300]   So it's a way of decreasing your liabilities.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.140]   But that's just, that's not so much a tax strategy
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.340]   as it is a retirement inflation strategy,
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.100]   especially now that the new stimulus bill has been passed,
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.700]   America's Rescue Plan, it's called.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.180]   We suddenly find inflation poking up its head
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.620]   for the first time in 20 years.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.220]   - Generally, the way I frame it,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.820]   and now we're getting into the midlife accumulators,
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:39.460]   you know, age 50 or so, we'll continue to march here,
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.260]   is that if you're gonna hold a lot of cash
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.840]   in your taxable account, you're not gonna hold CDs
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.580]   or short-term municipal bonds in your taxable account.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.340]   That buying back your mortgage,
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.060]   if you're not doing itemized deductions
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.940]   because you're doing standard deduction,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.180]   buying back your mortgage is the best bond you could buy
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.440]   because it gives you an after-tax return
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.500]   based on the amount of your mortgage interest.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.860]   Now, again, this is for people
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.260]   who are going to hold fixed income anyway.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.780]   I try to encourage them,
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.060]   well, don't hold so much fixed income.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.260]   If you're gonna hold fixed income,
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.460]   take some of that fixed income
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.220]   and just buy your mortgage back.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.540]   - Yes, yes, a mortgage is just a negative bond.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.540]   And so the two cancel each other out,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.780]   except to the extent to which
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.740]   you have a liquidity preference.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.980]   And it's not irrational to have a liquidity preference.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.180]   So there's that as well.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.060]   I should also say that I've been pushing
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.580]   the idea of mortgages when the mortgage rate
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.140]   has been two and a half, 3%,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.780]   figuring that this is gonna likely to go up over time.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.140]   As mortgage rates starts to amp up themselves,
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.340]   I'm gonna become less geeky
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.300]   about trying to take advantage of that.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.420]   - Let's talk about large, unrealized gains in stock
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.620]   that someone may have, might be A shares of stock,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.340]   which are original owner stock
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.220]   of a company that went public,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.140]   or maybe somebody was fortunate enough
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.300]   to buy Amazon 20 years ago,
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.660]   or Apple 20 years ago in their account,
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.060]   and they have a very large capital gain in one stock.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.380]   How do we deal with that?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.420]   - This is a very tough problem.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.740]   Every sensible person you talk to will say,
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.540]   sell and diversify.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.660]   Sell the stock, pay the taxes,
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.380]   and diversify into a broad index portfolio.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.540]   And I can't argue with that.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.140]   And whatever you do will turn out to be wrong.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.060]   So if you hang on to what the stock's gonna crater,
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.340]   if you sell it, it's gonna immediately double.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.340]   It's a tough position to be in.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.900]   And there are different strategies.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.100]   You can try to buy a portfolio of stocks
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.260]   that are going to complement it
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.300]   and behave differently than how Amazon might behave,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.460]   if you can figure that one out.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.300]   Or you can use some option strategy.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.020]   You've gotta be careful there
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.020]   because if you get it too tightly bound,
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.460]   you can end up with a constructive sale of the stock anyway.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.940]   The people that are selling those
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.980]   tends to be quite expensive service they're providing
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.420]   when you look at all that.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.700]   You can use these exchange funds
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.740]   where people will take it off your hands
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.460]   and they'll give you shares of a mutual fund
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   made from other people's discarded, unloved big holdings.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.780]   But that is also one
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.220]   I've never really seen work out that well.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.580]   The fees tend to be very high
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.420]   and it's hard to know
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.980]   what you're gonna actually be getting
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.300]   when these things terminate.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.140]   So I don't know.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.980]   What do you think, Gregg?
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.380]   What do you do?
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.220]   - Well, you could use gifting
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.300]   to gift a portion of your shares to a charity
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.780]   through a donor advised fund
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   so that you could take a big tax deduction upfront.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.260]   And then now that you have a big tax deduction,
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.980]   you can offset that with taking a capital gain
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.780]   on the rest of the shares.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.100]   So you're gonna be popping up
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.500]   probably to a 20% capital gain tax
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.220]   and then you have your 3.8%
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.700]   net investment income tax on top of that.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.260]   And so whatever you gift to charity
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:30.180]   can help to offset that at the same time.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.660]   So they go hand in hand, right?
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.020]   A gift to charity,
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.100]   sell some of your appreciated assets.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.060]   And once you sell the appreciated assets, by the way,
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.300]   I tell people to do this at the beginning of the year,
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.540]   the beginning of the year.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.300]   Why do I say do it at the beginning of the year?
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.620]   Because then you could take the money
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.100]   and you could buy a total stock market index fund,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.780]   total international index fund, call it ETFs.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.700]   I like ETFs and taxable accounts.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.980]   And why would it be wise
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.820]   to do this at the beginning of the year?
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.380]   Because once you buy the total stock market ETF
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.980]   and the total international ETF,
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   if during the year the market goes down,
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.820]   you could do tax loss harvest
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.660]   by selling the total stock market ETF or one of them
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.660]   and turning around and buying another one that's similar,
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.740]   but not substantially identical.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.820]   You could sell the Vanguard total stock market ETF,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.660]   you can buy the iShare total stock market ETF.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.860]   There are two different companies,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.300]   there are two different indices,
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.780]   not substantially identical,
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.420]   but you get to take a tax loss.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.540]   And that's the key.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.420]   So if you did these trades,
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.900]   you wanna do them at the beginning of the year
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.900]   so you could take the money and do something else with it
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.900]   so that if the market does go down,
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.780]   you could do tax loss harvesting
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.340]   and swapping into similar funds,
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.540]   take the tax loss from that and offset some of the gain.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.620]   - Very good.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.900]   The only caveat I would say is that
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.620]   under the new Biden plan,
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   the idea is to cap the deductions at 28%.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.220]   And of course, the devil's in the details,
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.380]   we'll see what actually emerges.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.740]   But if your deductions are capped at 28%,
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.660]   the benefit from donating your appreciated stock
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.700]   to a donor advised fund
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.300]   might not be as much as it was before.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.940]   So it's gonna make the strategy slightly less good.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.260]   It's better than nothing.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.540]   It's a great way to go.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.620]   It's better than holding onto the stock
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.820]   and watching it go down 90%
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.580]   because of something you didn't see,
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.300]   which is what will happen if you keep it.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.380]   - There are some people who say
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.580]   that doing what's called direct indexing is a good idea,
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.620]   which is to take from the sale
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.900]   of a highly appreciated security,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.700]   taking that money
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.340]   and putting it into a direct indexing portfolio,
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.380]   which is nothing more than
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.980]   you give it to an investment advisor
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.700]   who buys all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 in one account.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.700]   And then as the individual stocks one by one have losses
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.260]   to harvest the losses and therefore in the first year,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.620]   again, if you did this at the beginning of the year,
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.460]   in the first year,
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.820]   you could harvest a lot more losses
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.500]   than doing the ETF strategy that I talked about.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.340]   The problem with that is number one,
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.380]   you have 500 stocks.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.780]   That's a problem right there.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.940]   And secondly, 20 years from now,
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.420]   you still have 500 stocks,
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.060]   even though this thing has played out
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.900]   and you've gotten your losses from it.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.740]   And you have to continue
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.540]   to pay management fees along the way.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.540]   It makes it very cumbersome for you
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.020]   and complicated to try to do this direct indexing.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.020]   And getting back to your concept of turning your stock in
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.700]   and getting a basket of stocks later,
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.540]   I think you have to wait seven years.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.740]   Yes, seven years at very high fees typically too.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.780]   Right.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.700]   So there's really no great solution
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.780]   to what to do about the highly appreciated stock
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.540]   in the portfolio.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.100]   Selling little by little as you move along
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.180]   might be helpful.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.300]   It's always a question that people have.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.140]   What do I do with this?
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.100]   And my answer was,
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.260]   well, you should have done a mega backdoor Roth
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.660]   and you should have bought it in a Roth.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.620]   (laughing)
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.460]   Yes.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.260]   And you wouldn't have any tax issues.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.540]   In fact, I tell people,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.580]   going forward now that we finally cleaned up your portfolio,
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.940]   if you're ever gonna buy stocks again,
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.580]   individual stocks, please do them in your Roth.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.940]   So we don't have any tax issues.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.860]   That's where you would wanna buy individual stocks.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.780]   If you have the capacity, buy them in your Roth.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.820]   I am a fan of the idea of direct indexing.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.180]   I don't think the implementation
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.780]   is quite where we want it to be yet,
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.340]   but I think it will get there.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.620]   I think there's real potential there,
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.100]   especially if it will let me tweak the portfolio
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.620]   along the dimensions that I wanna tweak it.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.140]   And that will go into factor investing
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.100]   or zero dividend investing and stuff like that.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.300]   So I think it has potential,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.860]   but I haven't seen a solution to it
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.100]   that I'm been on board enough with yet to say,
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.980]   okay, let's do that.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.660]   - Yeah, I think the solution in the end,
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.420]   I've been putting this out there for years,
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.220]   has been if somebody, some entrepreneurial person
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   came up with a methodology for taking that portfolio
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.620]   and turning it into an ETF company
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.220]   and getting shares of one single ETF
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.380]   at the cost basis of the entire portfolio,
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.780]   that would be a marvelous idea.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.260]   Of course, the direct indexing companies
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.460]   are not gonna do that
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.300]   because they don't wanna lose
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.220]   those management fees every year.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.260]   So it would have to be an ETF company
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.900]   that actually comes up with that solution.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.260]   Take your direct indexing portfolio,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.420]   turn it into us,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.380]   and we will give you shares of S&P 500 index fund
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.260]   at the cost basis of the whole portfolio
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.860]   if the IRS will buy off on that.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.220]   - Well, I think it's up to you to do it, Rick.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.060]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.980]   - Can I just say one more thing about this?
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.260]   Under the new Biden tax plan,
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.700]   it could well be the case
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.420]   that if you earn over a million dollars,
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.220]   that you would be paying 39.6% on capital gains.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.060]   Now you're looking at your Amazon stock that's appreciated,
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.900]   and you're thinking,
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.020]   "Well, gee, do I wanna pay 20% on capital gains this year,
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.540]   or do I wanna roll the dice
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.900]   and maybe pay 40% on capital gains next year?"
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.380]   So these are the kinds of things
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.180]   that investors are gonna be thinking about
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.980]   by the end of 2021.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.380]   - I think we will know by the end of 2021
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.020]   which direction these tax changes are gonna go.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.100]   Next year, remember, is another election year.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.060]   Let's go ahead and move on to getting ready for retirement.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.420]   Again, getting ready for retirement.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.060]   We have money in a 401(k).
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.980]   We have money in a Roth account.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.220]   We have something in our taxable account.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.020]   We need to take Social Security at some point,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.060]   but we don't know when.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.020]   We may wanna do some Roth conversions.
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   This period between age 59 1/2 and call it 69
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.060]   before, if you decide to delay Social Security,
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.700]   or even 65 when you get Medicare,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.380]   there's a lot going on during this period of time.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.020]   - This is the most underrated period
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.540]   for tax planning imaginable.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.580]   There is suddenly a lot of potential.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.300]   I think it really starts when you decide to retire.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.140]   Between the retirement
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.740]   and between when you have to start taking
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.740]   required minimum distributions from your retirement plans,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.380]   you have a window of opportunity to look ahead
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.180]   over the entire sweep of your retirement
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.740]   and do some canny tax planning.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.660]   And so I strongly encourage people
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.860]   to take advantage of this time
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.100]   because suddenly your income is low.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.420]   You're not getting a big paycheck from your job
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.180]   and that means that you have the potential
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.660]   to possibly do some Roth IRA conversions.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.180]   If you fail to take advantage of this,
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.180]   what will happen is that you'll be forced to withdraw money
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.380]   from your traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s,
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.540]   all of your traditional qualified plans.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:15.540]   And that check starts out being 3.6%, something like that.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.700]   But the amount of the check is going to escalate
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.100]   as a percentage of the plan every year
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.740]   until by the time you're 90 years old,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.500]   you're taking out 10% of your plan every year.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.340]   And so it's gonna knock you into higher tax brackets
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.220]   over the course of your retirement,
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.980]   or at least that's what you wanna guard against.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.620]   So you need to sort of step back
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.100]   and take a look at what's gonna be happening.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.500]   The second big thing you need to take a look at
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.460]   is in the event that you don't live forever
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.620]   or your spouse doesn't live forever,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.380]   what's gonna happen when you or your spouse die
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.620]   and the remaining party, the last person standing,
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.220]   is gonna suddenly be filing single
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.900]   rather than married filing joint.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.020]   And they're gonna find, wait a minute,
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.380]   I've got a whole different set of tax brackets
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.380]   that I've gotta apply now.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.940]   And so I'm paying taxes at a much higher rate
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.340]   than I was before.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.500]   So you've got to step back and see,
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.940]   how can I plan for these contingencies
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.260]   and what's the best way of doing it?
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   - Well, let's also throw into this that at age 65,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.500]   you're gonna go on Medicare.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.940]   And Medicare is gonna be based on the decisions you make
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.380]   at age 63, unless you file a form otherwise,
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.980]   where if you're doing these Roth conversions,
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   63, 64, 65, it could bump you up into higher Medicare costs.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.900]   You have to take into account so many variables,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.460]   it's unbelievable.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.540]   And they're variables that are in many cases,
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.020]   we just don't know the answer.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.540]   We don't know what the future of the tax code is.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.580]   We don't know how long you're gonna live
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.820]   or your spouse is gonna live if you're married.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.860]   We don't know what the future
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.060]   of your investment returns are gonna be.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:10.060]   So this is not an easy Rubik's cube to get lined up.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.220]   There are all these different thresholds
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.780]   you've gotta be watching out for.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   And this is why we have to resort to the use of tools,
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.260]   financial planning tools,
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.340]   to try to wrap our brains around the problem.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.780]   - Well, there's a lot of good software out there now,
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.780]   new retirement and income solver.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.900]   There's several software packages that help you do this.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.700]   - And I encourage people to be very judicious
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.780]   in their use of it.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.580]   I don't think people should just plug in the numbers,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.620]   push the button and then do what it says.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.180]   They need to really think about
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.620]   how all these things interact and ask questions.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.820]   What happens if I live longer?
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:56.700]   What happens if tax rates rise more than I think?
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.860]   What if my investment returns
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.980]   aren't as good as I hope they are?
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.860]   And look at many different kinds of scenarios
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   to get a sense of where's the sweet spot
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.780]   in terms of my Roth IRA conversion strategy
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.420]   and my retirement income drawdown strategy.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.220]   - I'll give a plug to the Bogleheads on bogleheads.org.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   If you go to bogleheads.org wiki, tools and calculators,
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.020]   there's a whole range of calculators
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.540]   that Bogleheads have created for free
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.060]   and put it up on the wiki.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.340]   And there's all types of RMD calculators,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.900]   retirement calculators, social security calculators,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.780]   Roth conversion calculators.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.740]   If you're looking for a calculator
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.140]   to come up with some numbers and for free
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.700]   on bogleheads.org, the wiki under tools and calculators,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.020]   you're gonna find it there.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.460]   - A sensational resource.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.860]   - So we've got this dilemma here
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.180]   where we have to look at all this
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.980]   and we have to make a determination at some point.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.580]   When do we take social security
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.180]   and how did social security work into all of that?
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.540]   - This is something that I would turn over to a calculation,
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.620]   to a tool of some kind.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.180]   Social Security Solutions offers one,
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:17.020]   Kotlikoff offers one, I think with Maxify Planner.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.740]   There are free versions of this floating around.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.140]   - Michael Piper has a great version.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.820]   - Michael Piper's version, exactly.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.020]   - Open social security.com.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.660]   - And there's a little bit of judgment involved
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.340]   in using these, but basically you want to plug in
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.780]   your numbers, spouse numbers or earnings,
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.940]   longevity estimates and find out
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.540]   when to take social security.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.980]   Maybe it's just me, I have an inherent bias towards,
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.620]   let's put it off to the last possible minute.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:47.140]   The idea of being able to get an inflation adjusted annuity
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.220]   from the government is, I mean, this is not sold in stores.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.580]   You can't buy this from any private company.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:59.220]   So I love the idea of watching that grow 8% a year
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.180]   from full retirement age to the maximum age
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.580]   at which I can take it.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.580]   I just don't see anybody offering anything like that.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:12.540]   - And especially if you are married and you die first,
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.700]   that annuity is gonna be very valuable for your spouse.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.540]   - Yes.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.860]   - So my bias is to wait, but the claiming strategies
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.780]   do get complicated and you should pay close attention
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.940]   to them because there are occasions when one person
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.820]   should wait, the other person should file early.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.700]   You need to look at the software
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.220]   and then before you start getting cute
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.500]   with your own opinions about things.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.900]   - So at age 72, at least that's the age now,
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.420]   you have to start taking required minimum distributions
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.620]   and you take your ending balance of December 31st
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.140]   to divide it by 25.6 is the number right now.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.060]   And it tells you how much you have to take as an RMD.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.980]   And then it goes up, have to take out more and more
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.460]   and more and more, so your taxes go up.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.740]   But I've got some clients who looked at that and said,
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   you know, that's okay because my children
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.140]   are not making much money.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.020]   So, and maybe my health isn't all that great.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.100]   So I wanna die with a lot of money
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.140]   in my pre-tax retirement account
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.940]   so that my children will inherit this money.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.140]   And even if they had to take it out
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.660]   over a 10 year period of time, which is the new law,
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.020]   they're in a low tax bracket and they can actually
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.140]   get the money out at a lower tax bracket than I can.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.620]   And then I have the opposite, by the way,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.700]   where there are some people who are retired who say,
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.900]   no, you know, our children are making a lot of money
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.660]   and they're all in the highest tax brackets.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.700]   We are retired and we're in the low tax bracket.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.620]   So we're gonna take out as much as we can
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.100]   up to say the top of the 32% bracket every year,
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.700]   more than what we need to take out.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.500]   We're gonna put that into a Roth
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.740]   because even though we're paying the taxes currently
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.620]   on that, we're paying it at a lower tax bracket
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.460]   than what our children would pay it at
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.980]   when they get their inheritance.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.560]   Now it just depends on each person.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.340]   - Well, it goes back to the same question as earlier.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.660]   These retirement plans are owned partly by you
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.380]   and partly by the government.
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.860]   And you want to pull the money out
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.940]   when your share is the greatest
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.860]   and the government share is the least.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.100]   So if your taxes are higher than your kids,
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.020]   then that dictates a different plan
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.100]   than if your kids' taxes are higher than yours.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.180]   If your kids' taxes are higher,
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.620]   you wanna give them a Roth.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.340]   If your taxes are higher,
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.700]   then you want to give the kids a traditional,
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.300]   let them inherit the traditional IRA.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.440]   - Now there is one thing we could do
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.420]   to lower our required minimum distribution,
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:37.700]   and that is a qualified charitable distribution.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.980]   I wanna touch on this and then get into,
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.380]   last thing we'll talk about is estate planning.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.980]   What is a qualified charitable distribution?
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:51.620]   - Well, the IRS has said that anybody over 70
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.260]   can apply up to $100,000
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.780]   of their required minimum distribution.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.580]   And instead, they can ship it to a charity,
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.760]   not a private family foundation,
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.940]   not a donor-advised fund.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.760]   But if it's a public charity,
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.320]   they can give the money to that,
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.000]   or they can split it to 20 public charities if they want.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   Up to $100,000 will count towards their RMD.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.680]   So this is gonna become very useful,
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   especially for higher income individuals in retirement.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.840]   You can use it to target a particular number
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.940]   for Medicare or capital gains or whatever you want.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.720]   You could just look at the tax code and say,
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.880]   I wanna have my income this year hit this number.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.140]   And using strategically
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.500]   these qualified charitable distributions,
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.020]   it's a way to do it.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.920]   Just make sure that the qualified charitable distribution
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.960]   comes out before the rest of your RMD.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.720]   You can't pull out the RMD
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.960]   and then think at the end of the year,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.380]   well, now I'll take out this
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.160]   qualified charitable distribution.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.000]   It's too late.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.920]   That'll just count as you won't get the tax benefit from it.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.760]   I didn't know that.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.040]   I appreciate that.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.400]   Let's talk about some more estate planning things
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.640]   as we're now at the end of life
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:17.160]   and what can we be doing tax-wise to help future generations?
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.080]   - One of the big things now,
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.080]   again, I'm looking at the Biden plan.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.040]   It's gonna reshape estate planning significantly
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:31.800]   because the goal is to get the estate tax exemption
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.120]   from whatever it is, 11.68 million,
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.160]   cut it 70% down to three and a half million,
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.240]   which means suddenly lots of people that thought,
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.320]   oh, estate problems, we don't got them.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.760]   Suddenly they have estate problems.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.420]   So your estate planning attorneys,
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.640]   tax planning attorneys
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.920]   are gonna be doing a booming business this year,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.520]   redoing everybody's estate plan.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   So the big question is gonna be like,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.400]   a small business owner, holy smokes,
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.840]   I don't wanna pay 40% of the taxes
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.140]   on the sale of this business to IRS.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.920]   I've gotta find some way of getting this business,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.640]   this personal business out of my estate.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.160]   And I'm gonna have to maybe do an installment sale
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.120]   to a trust of some kind,
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.000]   but somehow I don't want it to be part of my estate
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.360]   because it could even be taxed twice.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.840]   It could be taxed as part of my income tax,
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.280]   and it could also be taxed as part of my estate tax
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.400]   if I were to sell it.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.200]   'Cause remember, they're talking about
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.920]   enforced capital gains recognition at death.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.700]   And this is another whole new thing
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:43.320]   that's going to really stir the pot in estate planning.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.880]   And it's gonna even have implications
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.120]   for people that are retired,
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.880]   who suddenly think I've got my $10 million in Amazon stock,
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.120]   so do I wanna pay the tax on it at 40%
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.360]   where I wanna ship $4 million to the government when I die,
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.880]   or do I wanna ship just 2 million to the government
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.800]   if I sell it this year?
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.000]   There are gonna be all these issues rising to the forefront
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.960]   one way or the other.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.860]   We don't know what the final plan's gonna look like.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.360]   We know what has been discussed,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.800]   but it's gonna have very, very big implications
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.200]   and coordinating your tax planning and retirement
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:25.000]   with your estate plan is going to be absolutely crucial.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   - Phil, it's been wonderful to have you on the show today.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.660]   Really appreciate your insights.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.120]   And the name of the book is called
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.480]   "The Overtaxed Investor, Slash Your Tax Bill
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.160]   and Be a Tax Alpha Dog."
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.480]   And I imagine that when the new Biden tax bill comes out,
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.760]   you're gonna be doing another edition?
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.120]   - Back to the drawing board, you bet.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.520]   - (laughs) Okay.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.980]   Well, thank you so much for being
