[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - We close the week with a very important question,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.960]   one that we never want to assume
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.400]   and one that we never want to ignore.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.560]   It comes to us from a new podcast listener named Kayla.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480]   Pastor John, is God the same God in all religions
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.080]   but in different forms?
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.820]   I've heard this said before, but what does the Bible say?
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880]   - Let me make sure that I understand the question.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.540]   I take Kayla to be asking,
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.480]   if we sincerely worship the God of any religion,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.900]   are we worshiping the one true God?
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.780]   That's my rephrasing of the question.
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.700]   Or we could ask it like this.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700]   Does the Bible teach that the gods of other religions
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.220]   besides Christianity are real supernatural beings
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   distinct from and in opposition to the one true God
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.840]   and father of our Lord Jesus?
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.740]   So those are the two ways I would rephrase the question.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.740]   And the answer to the second one is yes.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.500]   The Bible teaches that the gods of other religions
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.280]   are not mere names.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.400]   They're not mere myths,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.520]   but are in fact supernatural beings
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   who love to be worshiped and want to deceive the world
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.000]   and receive acclaim and take the place of the true God.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.900]   And the answer to the first question is therefore no.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.080]   If you sincerely worship these gods of other religions,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.500]   you're not worshiping the one true God
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.040]   revealed in Jesus Christ.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.600]   So that's my answer.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   Now here's some Bible verses
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.780]   to show you where I get that answer.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.380]   The apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10, 19,
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560]   "What do I imply then?
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.260]   "That food offered to idols is anything
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.720]   "or that an idol is anything?
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.720]   "No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.680]   "they offer to demons and not to God."
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.720]   I do not want you to be participants with demons.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.480]   So the question he was dealing with
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500]   was food offered to idols in another religion
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.060]   and whether Christians should participate.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.000]   And his explanation was that these sacrifices
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.160]   in the other religions in the first century
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120]   were not sacrifices to the true God,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.960]   as though behind every religion was the same God,
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.120]   but they were sacrifices to supernatural beings,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   he calls them demons, who were in opposition to God.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.440]   That's what a demon is.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   So what Paul is claiming is simply a continuation
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.120]   of what God had already revealed in the Old Testament.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.900]   There is one true God in Israel, Yahweh,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   who revealed himself by his word to Moses and the prophets,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.760]   and there are other gods of the nations,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.100]   real supernatural beings
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.080]   that his people were not to worship.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   For example, Deuteronomy 29, 18,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.660]   "Beware, lest there be among you a man or a woman
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.660]   "whose heart is turning away today from Yahweh, your God,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.920]   "or the Lord our God,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   "to go and serve the gods of those nations."
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.480]   Or Joshua 23, 7,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.260]   "You may not mix with these nations remaining among you,
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.520]   "or make mention of the names of their gods,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.400]   "or swear by them, or serve them, or bow down to them,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.340]   "but you shall cling to Yahweh, your God,
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000]   "just as you have done to this day."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.940]   So God made it clear numerous times in the Old Testament
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.240]   from the beginning that there were other gods,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.560]   there were other religions,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   and his people were not to assume
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.980]   that these gods are simply manifestations
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.600]   of his own true being,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.780]   as if the same god were behind every religion.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.460]   They were different, they were competitors,
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.580]   they were enemies, they were demonic, they are not God.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.400]   They are contenders for deity.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.140]   They are real supernatural demonic realities.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.040]   And the great issue of life is,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.280]   will you serve the one true God,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   or will you serve other gods?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.280]   So Elijah, or Mel Carmel, put it like this,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.640]   in the great contest between Yahweh on the one side
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.520]   and Baal, the god on the other side.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.300]   He says, "How long will you go limping
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.860]   "between two different opinions?
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.040]   "If Yahweh is God, follow him.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.660]   "But if Baal, then follow him."
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.320]   So Baal is not Yahweh.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.380]   You can't say, "Oh, all those sincere Baal worshipers
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.860]   "are worshiping the true God."
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.460]   The Bible makes zero sense if that's the case.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.940]   They are great enemies.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.420]   So the first commandment is,
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.360]   "You shall have no other gods before me."
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.880]   Exodus 20, verse three.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   Here's the most crucial issue in our day.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.940]   Ever since Jesus came into the world
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.940]   as the final decisive revelation of the true God,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.460]   he himself, as he revealed himself in history,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.200]   is the test of whether any claim
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   to be worshiping the true God is a real claim.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.440]   So for example, 1 John 4, verse one.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.920]   Beloved, do not believe every spirit.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.880]   So if a spirit says, "This is a true religion.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.520]   "This is true God over here."
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.200]   Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.240]   to see whether they are from God.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.560]   Now, how are we gonna do that?
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.600]   For many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.080]   By this you know the spirit of God.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   has come in the flesh is from God,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.960]   and every spirit that does not confess Jesus
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.120]   is not from God.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.080]   In other words, the real Jesus of history
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.720]   revealed in scripture is the litmus test
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.560]   of every claim to supernatural reality.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.680]   Any religion that does not embrace and worship
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.360]   and obey Jesus for who he is revealed in the Bible
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.440]   is a false religion.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.600]   It is not the true God incognito.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.120]   Jesus put it like this in John 5, 23.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.720]   Whoever does not honor the son, Jesus,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.800]   does not honor the father who sent him.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.160]   No matter what they say, he's talking to Pharisees
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.680]   who really said they trusted and believed
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.520]   in the God of the Old Testament.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.560]   He's saying, "No, you don't because you don't accept me."
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.480]   Jesus is the litmus test for all religions,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.840]   including Judaism.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.560]   And again, John 8, 42.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.120]   If God were your father, you would love me
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.400]   for I came from God and I am here.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.000]   In 1 John 2, 23, John says,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   "No one who denies the son has the father.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.840]   Whoever confesses the son has the father also."
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.400]   So my conclusion from the Bible
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.320]   is that there are real supernatural beings
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   behind other religions, but they are not the true God.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.080]   They are contenders against God.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.800]   They are demons and deceivers.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.720]   And the way to test all claims to truth in religion
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.960]   is Jesus Christ.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.440]   He is the final and decisive revelation
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.280]   of the one true God.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.000]   - Wow, behind every religion is a supernatural being.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.920]   That is a profound thought.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those wise words.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.320]   And thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.200]   Well, next time, we've got an interesting question
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.040]   on the table.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   We usually do have interesting questions on the table.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.920]   I hope we always do.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.080]   But this one is going to be,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.720]   the next one is gonna be about the worship song,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.480]   "What a Beautiful Name."
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.680]   That's the title.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.280]   You've probably not only heard the song,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.320]   you've likely sung it in your local church.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   We have a question about the line in the second verse,
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.840]   this line that says, "You didn't want heaven without us,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.480]   so Jesus, you brought heaven down."
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.960]   Is that right?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.000]   Is it right to say that God did not want heaven without us?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.400]   It's the first time I can recall that an email came in
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.360]   asking Pastor John to evaluate contemporary worship lyrics
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.160]   of a very popular song.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.440]   And we're gonna do that very thing next time.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.880]   And we're gonna talk also about why we would even step back
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.800]   and look at worship lyrics in the first place.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.840]   It's a really important discussion.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.500]   I don't think you'll wanna miss it.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.600]   Launching Sunday evening, about 7.30 Central Time.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.080]   You won't wanna miss this one.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.040]   We'll see you next week.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.200]   (upbeat music)
