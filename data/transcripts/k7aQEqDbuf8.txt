[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Khabib beat Conor. Putin was on FaceTime before he even made it to the locker room. Trump,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.080]   sitting president, ex-president, watching all the fights, calling, wants to talk about the fights.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   Valentina Shevchenko, every time she goes home, she meets with the president of the country.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.560]   The list goes on and on and on. The most powerful... Elon Musk, Zuckerberg. I mean,
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.080]   the list goes on and on and on. The most powerful people in the world are all obsessed with fighting.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.760]   The following is a conversation with Dana White, the president of the UFC,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.320]   a mixed martial arts organization that revolutionized the art, the sport,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.080]   and the business of fighting. And Dana is truly the mastermind behind the UFC.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.720]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Dana White. Do you remember when you saw your first fight?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   I think so. I remember being at my grandmother's house, and I think it was an Ali fight. And all
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560]   my uncles were going crazy during the fight. And there was just this buzz and this energy in the
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.880]   house that I liked at a very young age. And I'm pretty sure that was my first fight.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.320]   Ali was something special.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.200]   Yeah. Incredible. I mean, when you look around, not just here in the office, but at my house,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.280]   Ali and Tyson are everywhere.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.160]   Would you put Ali as the greatest of all time, Boxing?
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.920]   Well, I would put Ali as the greatest all-time human being. I mean, when you...
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.440]   It's easy as a fight fan to focus on him as a fighter. But when you focus on him as a human,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.720]   and you think about what he meant at that time and place, the things he said, the poems he came
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:03.520]   up with, just the overall brilliance of Muhammad Ali, the guts. The guts to have the strength
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.480]   mentally, physically, and emotionally to go against the grain at the time that he did it.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   It was a very dangerous time for him to be who he was. Yet, because of how smart he was,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.840]   and because of his personality, and how if you sat down with him, you could be the biggest racist
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.000]   on the planet. It's hard to get in a room with Ali and not like Ali.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   Yeah. He's all love, humor, all of it.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.920]   A hundred percent.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   And had the guts in the ring, and the guts to take a stand.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   A hundred percent.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.600]   When it was hard.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   He might be one of the all-time greatest humans. You know what I mean? Just an impactful, powerful
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.960]   human being who happened to be a great boxer.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.920]   And sometimes the right moment meets the great human being. That's important.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.560]   I agree with you. And he was the right guy in the right place at the right time.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.080]   And he's also a guy who used his platform for all the right things.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.280]   So that might've been your first fight, but when did you fall in love with fighting?
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520]   The art of it, the science of it?
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.640]   Yeah. I would say I really fell in love with it. So I was a senior. It was 1987,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.200]   and Hagler-Leonard happened.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.480]   And I watched that fight, and I taped it. And I watched that fight like a million times.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.600]   I was a huge, huge Hagler fan. And I like Sugar Ray Leonard too, but I was a huge Hagler fan.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.480]   And, you know, I just remember I watched that fight a million times
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.760]   because I was pissed off and I felt like Hagler got robbed in the fight. You know what I mean?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   But that was really what made me start to love the sport of boxing.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.160]   The battle of it.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.560]   I was 17. And then after that, USA's Tuesday Night Fights came out on television. It was
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.200]   on every Tuesday night. Religiously never missed Tuesday Night Fights. I was there,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.840]   watched all those fights. And a lot of the things you see in the UFC, not necessarily
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.240]   just the production, but I would say the feel and the style and all those things are all things that
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.320]   I... Things that I loved about boxing and things that I hated about boxing, right down to the
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.360]   commentary.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.160]   You loved and hated?
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.120]   Hated, yeah.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.080]   Hated the commentary.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.920]   Certain things that I loved about boxing, I incorporated into the UFC. Things that I hated
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.240]   about boxing, I made sure that the UFC stayed far away from. I think I can't stand Larry Merchant.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.400]   Can't stand Larry Merchant. And I used to watch HBO Boxing and mute the commentary so that I
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.000]   didn't have to listen to them. Lampley, too. You know, you would spend this money for the
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.440]   pay-per-view to watch these people that you idolized, to hear these idiots rip them apart
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.800]   while the fight was happening, you know?
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   Oh, they were criticizing.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.260]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.900]   Taking them apart.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.820]   I've gotten used to the UFC, so I don't... I'm trying to remember looking back.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.460]   It was bad.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.100]   It was bad?
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.820]   It was really bad.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.140]   But the sweet science, the art of boxing was beautiful still. Like, the stories they told.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.180]   100%. I want to do this with you right now. Hey, will you bring your cell phone over here and
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.980]   pull up YouTube? I want to do this for you so that you can understand this and understand where
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.180]   I was coming from.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.140]   For the commentary.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.980]   Yeah, at this point in time.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.380]   I have all good memories. You're going to ruin it for me.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.540]   Yeah, no, there are nothing but great memories about boxing. But the presentation and a lot of
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.780]   things. But it's how fucking weird is it that I even cared about this shit at that point in my
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.260]   life and that time in my life? Like, what impact could I possibly have on it? So think about Tyson
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.620]   and how much everybody loved Tyson at the time. And listen to this. Listen to this entrance.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.380]   Of the former undisputed heavyweight champion. And here he comes. Mike Tyson,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.020]   as he heads toward the same ring, he made his distraceful exit in June of '96.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.520]   Wow.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.820]   One of the baddest motherfucking walk-ins of all time, by the way, right?
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.140]   So what this guy should be doing. And this is one of the Albert brothers.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.140]   Shut the fuck up.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.660]   Stay out of the way.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.700]   Yeah. Maybe build them up.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.740]   Or that. Or don't say anything.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.180]   Just let the fans. That's why we paid our money.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.140]   You don't need to say anything.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.100]   Scary, imposing music.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:51.380]   Will he be able to intimidate his opponent tonight? Will it even matter?
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:59.380]   I really thought there'd be more of an explosion by the crowd here, but very mixed.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.940]   Even with the win tonight, no matter how one sided, he will still have his detractors.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:13.540]   Following the two fights with Holyfield, his stock plummeted. The pundits came down hard
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.860]   feeling they were duped and his knockouts were over second rate fighters.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.380]   Now the crowd erupts more as he gets into the ring, but it's certainly nothing overwhelming.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.700]   What a dick. You're right. I don't remember that. You're right.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.820]   Imagine.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.260]   You're right.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:40.420]   You paid your money to watch Mike Tyson and you got to listen to these fucking jerk offs
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:46.020]   talk shit about him the whole way to the right. First of all, one of the coolest walk-ins ever.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.900]   First time anybody had heard DMX, right?
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.820]   Yeah. That's right.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.580]   He's walking into some scary, imposing music. Will it even matter?
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:03.700]   It's just all that kind of stuff. I literally used to analyze every ounce of the production
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.860]   that would happen on television. And at a time when I didn't even know why I was doing it, but...
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.180]   But it's in there somewhere. You were thinking about it.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.220]   Right? So yeah, I hated HBO commentary. I thought at the time,
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.740]   HBO boxing was obviously the gold standard, but when you really think about boxing at that time,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.540]   their production, the only thing that changed over 30 years was like HD. I mean, even the
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:35.780]   commentators were the same for 30 years. And then you had the time when Larry Merchant gets up and
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.300]   literally starts fighting with Floyd Mayweather during the interview and says, "If I was 30 years
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.260]   younger, I'd kick your ass right now." Oh yeah. I remember that. Yeah.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.580]   I mean, these are the interviews that we have to listen to
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.140]   when we're trying to watch a boxing match.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.740]   The level of boxing was good.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:57.220]   Think about a fighter, right? Fighter has been gone for months, away from their families and
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.740]   away from everything, training, cutting weight, sparring. Then they go in and they have to fight
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.700]   that night. And then you have to... If you watch your fight back, you got to listen to this bullshit
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.380]   from these guys. And then you get interviewed and your interview is this. It's just...
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.180]   And it's not just about the pay-per-view money. It's about like,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.380]   these are legends of humanity. We should celebrate the highest form of accomplishment.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:21.940]   100%.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.300]   These aren't like Mike Tyson.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   So you know who goes in there and interviews fighters? Joe Rogan, right? Who has trained and
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:37.460]   done everything and has the utmost respect for the sport and the athletes. Or you got like Daniel
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.180]   Cormier, who was a former world champion himself and has actually been through it, done it, knows.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.460]   And those are the type of people that we put in the booth, people that are actually experienced
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.540]   in it. Not these people who've never been in a fight in their fucking life, right?
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.740]   Yeah. But they're also both, DC and Rogan are like big kids. They love it.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.220]   100%.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.020]   They really love it.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.500]   Well, everybody does. I mean, if you look at... It's the difference between our commentary and
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.180]   what I feel their commentary was. We don't hire paid talking heads. We hire people that have
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:16.500]   actually been in it, done it, love it, and are super passionate about the sport. And I would
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.860]   say that none of them that ever covered the sport back then were... I don't know if that was Marv
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.780]   Albert or what Albert brother that was, but he sounded like he's a fan of the sport or... Anyway.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.220]   You got me on this and once I get on it, I lose my mind.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.460]   Maybe we wouldn't have a UFC if they didn't fuck it up so bad for the Tyson.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.580]   It would be different. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. It would be different. There's no
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.940]   doubt about it. All those experiences growing up, being a boxing fan help create what the UFC is
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.260]   today.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:54.820]   It's interesting because humans have been fighting for millennia and it seems like with the UFC,
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:01.700]   the rate of innovation is just insane. In these last three decades, it seems like we've discovered
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:09.380]   how to do unarmed combat faster and better than at any time in human history.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:16.340]   I agree with you 100%. The first UFC happened in 1993, right? Martial art versus martial art.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:23.060]   And now over the last 30 years, martial arts has evolved faster than... You know what I mean? And
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:29.780]   like you just said, combat sports, fighting, whatever you want to call it, martial arts,
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.780]   it has evolved so much in 30 years, more than the last 300 years.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.020]   What did you think when you saw UFC 1 with Hoyce?
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.060]   I remember everybody talking that this fight was going to happen and there was going to be no rules
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.620]   and all this other stuff and we're like, "There's no way. That's bullshit." And then we ended up at
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.980]   some guy's house that night in Boston and watching it and it was happening and it was fun and it was
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.980]   exciting and everything else. And then I sort of fell off after that. The first one I watched,
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:04.500]   but I was too big of a boxing fan. Plus, once grappling started taking over and by grappling,
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.580]   meaning the wrestling and the jujitsu guys had just laid there, I completely lost interest.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.220]   It's funny that I'm having this conversation with you right now because last night,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.820]   I was out last night with my friends and we were talking about... Because one of my buddies,
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.180]   who's a host here in town, just did jujitsu for the first time yesterday.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.580]   Nice. Yeah.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.380]   And he was like...
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.420]   Did he get his ass kicked?
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.220]   Yeah, yeah. But when you first go in, our first jujitsu lesson, me, Lorenzo, and Frank was with
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:45.300]   John Lewis. And I remember thinking, "Holy shit. I can't believe that I'm 28 years old
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.340]   and this is the first time I'm experiencing this, that another human being could do this to me
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:56.180]   on the ground." It is such an eye-opening, mind-blowing experience when you do it for
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:02.740]   the first time and then you become completely addicted to it. And we were training three,
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:09.620]   four days a week, trying to kill each other, me and the Fertittas, and that's how we fell
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:15.780]   in love with the sport. I think that first time that you do jujitsu, it's like the red pill and
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.420]   the blue pill in the Matrix. Do you want to believe that this is the world that you live in,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.580]   or do you want to see what the real world looks like?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.020]   Jujitsu is a real red pill.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.820]   It really is.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.420]   You realize, "Holy shit. All that shit talking I've been doing about me being a badass,"
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.420]   you realize you're not. You get dominated by another human being and you realize, "No."
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.340]   And I mean dominate. I mean completely treat you like you're a little kid.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:46.340]   And then we had the opportunity to roll with a lot of different guys at the time because of the,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.060]   whatever. And we don't have a good relationship at all, but I'll tell you this. Frank Shamrock
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:14:00.980]   came in one day and Frank Shamrock had me in side control. The pressure that this guy put on my
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:08.820]   chest made me tap. Felt like there was a car on my chest and with zero effort from him. It was
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:16.500]   absolutely effortless. And when you train with somebody that's at such a level when you're not,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.900]   it is the most humbling, mind-blowing experience you can have, especially as a man,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.860]   but as a human being.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:29.460]   Do you remember, just for fun, do you remember what your go-to submission was?
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:35.060]   Yeah. So when we first started out and started doing it, I had a pretty good guillotine in the
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.300]   beginning. So I'd catch a lot of people in guillotines and-
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.060]   So you're okay being on bottom?
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.820]   Yeah, I was okay with the bottom. Yeah. I was okay with being on bottom. I was comfortable there.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.100]   But you know what I never liked? I never liked gi. We started fucking around with a gi in the
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.420]   beginning. That's how we started. And then once I took the gi off, I felt like I had no submissions
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:00.580]   because I couldn't grab onto anything. So after that, I went all no-gi and I never wanted to
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.300]   wear a gi.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.900]   And it's fascinating because no-gi has become big now and there's a lot of interesting people. I got
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:11.700]   trained with Gordon Ryan and the level there is just fascinating. It's become like the science
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.980]   and it looks like fighting now. It looks more like fighting as opposed to with the gi, sometimes it
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.620]   doesn't quite look like fighting. And I feel like it's transferable to actual MMA fighting,
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.260]   no-gi stuff.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.140]   Or street.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.940]   Street, yeah.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:33.220]   Right? I mean, if you start off in your first year, you're in a gi, man, you better hope
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.420]   guy's got winter jackets on or something if something happens in the street. Because
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.380]   in my opinion, I know all the jiu-jitsu fucking people are going to go crazy over this, but
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.500]   in my opinion, no-gi is way better than gi.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.380]   That's why I also do judo. So in the street scenario, if you're comfortable on the feet
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:56.340]   and you can clench and you can throw, because most of us wear clothing, especially in Boston.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.460]   Right, exactly.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.580]   So if you're comfortable on the feet, you could still do well there. The problem with jiu-jitsu
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.420]   is most people are not comfortable on the feet, the sport jiu-jitsu. Most people kind of want to
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.220]   get to the ground as quickly as possible. So what'd you think of hoists at that time?
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.540]   Because it blew a lot of people's minds that there's more to this puzzle.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:25.780]   100%. And the fact that you had these guys like Ken Shamrock that were jacked, right? And you had
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.860]   all these wrestlers or the big, massive guys that they had in the different weight classes. And this
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.900]   skinny little dude-like hoist was out there beating everybody. I mean, if you look at the
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.100]   way the Gracies played that, you couldn't have a better advertisement for Gracie jiu-jitsu at the
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.580]   time.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:50.820]   But also for MMA, because there's just a lot of surprising elements. A lot of people's
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.380]   prediction was wrong. They didn't think the skinny guy would win. And they're like, "Oh shit,
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.500]   there's more to this."
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.340]   Well, it's the real beautiful thing about jiu-jitsu. It's like when you talk about,
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.740]   if you wanted to get your daughter into a martial art, "Should I put my daughter into karate? Or
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.980]   should I put her into this?" You put your daughter into jiu-jitsu 100%, because it's not about size
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:17.540]   or strength, it's about technique. And you give your daughter a bunch of jiu-jitsu and a little
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.700]   bit of Muay Thai, you know?
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.820]   Yeah, she becomes dangerous.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.180]   It's like the perfect combo.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.940]   Because you can put your son into anything. Your son can get into some, you know,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.700]   boys are going to learn how to fight and they're going to do whatever, but girls are different.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.940]   And the other thing, I mean, this is the biggest selling point for jiu-jitsu for women. I mean,
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.820]   when a woman, no matter how big, how small, can put a guy to sleep in three and a half seconds.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.260]   What's the origin story of the UFC as it is today, as you have created it and
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.300]   you and Lorenzo and Fertitto brothers built it?
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:53.940]   It started with John Lewis, you know, and seeing him. Frank and I were out one night at the Hard
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:59.460]   Rock and John Lewis was there. And he's like, "Oh, that's that ultimate fighting guy." And I was
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.980]   like, "I know him." And Frank's like, "I've always wanted to learn, uh, ground fighting."
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.020]   And I said, "Yeah, I'm interested in it too." So we went over, we talked to John Lewis
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.660]   and we made an appointment to wrestle with him on Monday.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:21.140]   And we told Lorenzo and Lorenzo came with us. And, uh, that was the beginning of the end. I mean,
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.980]   we, we started doing jiu-jitsu and, and started to meet a lot of the fighters. And we were like,
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   you know, at the time there was a stigma attached to the sport that these guys were, you know,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.460]   despicable, disgusting human beings, but which was the furthest thing from the truth. These,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.020]   these kids, uh, had all gone to college, had college degrees, most of them cause they wrestled
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.260]   in college. And we started to meet some, we loved the different stories. You had Chuck Liddell who,
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.460]   you know, had this Mohawk looks like an ax murderer and, uh, but graduated from Cal Poly,
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.220]   uh, you know, with honors and accounting, you know.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.740]   Then you had Matt Hughes, who was this farm boy, you know, literally lived on a farm. And
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.620]   so there were all these cool stories with all these good people that weren't what people
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.380]   thought they were. And Lorenzo and I always felt like there's something here that if this thing
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:19.860]   was done the right way, this could be big. And what was crazy was I, uh, I was in a contract
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:26.420]   negotiation with Bob Meyerowitz, the old owner of the UFC over Tito's contract. Um, and Chuck Liddell,
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.340]   they didn't even want Chuck Liddell in the UFC. I was trying to get Chuck in the UFC and they
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:36.660]   didn't even want them. And we got into this contract dispute over Tito's contract. And Bob
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.780]   Meyer would say, you know what? There is no more money. Okay. I don't even know if I'll even be
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.980]   able to put on one more event. And he like flipped out. We hung up the phone. I literally picked up
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.620]   the phone and called Lorenzo. And I said, Hey, I just got off the phone with Bob Meyerowitz, owner
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.100]   of the UFC. I think they're in trouble and I think we could buy it. And I think we should, you should
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:02.580]   reach out to him. So Lorenzo, uh, Lorenzo called Meyerowitz and I don't know how, I don't remember
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.660]   the timeline, but within the next two months, we ended up owning the UFC for 2 million bucks.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.660]   And, uh, you've said that you fought a lot of battles during that time.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:17.140]   Oh, I mean the early days of, of building this company and building the sport, it was the wild,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:24.500]   wild west, man. It was, it was crazy back then. Um, yeah, I was literally at war every day with
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:30.500]   all different types of people. Plus traditionally there's bad people that are involved in, in
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.220]   fighting, man. There's lots of bad people. And we had to sift our way through that for the first
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.340]   seven, eight years.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.340]   So in general, there's like corruption and then people kind of steal money. They're
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.340]   thinking just about themselves, not the bigger business.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.940]   Let me tell you about this. I mean, I want to say it was the Netherlands. I don't remember
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:51.620]   exactly where it could have been Amsterdam. I mean, MMA promoters were like car bombing each
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.380]   other. And then the other guy shot up the other guy's house with machine guns. And that's the
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.940]   kind of shit that was going on. I'll tell you the story. So affliction, do you remember affliction?
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.300]   So there was a guy, I want to say, I want to, I want to say the name was Tom,
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:15.540]   Todd Beard or something like that. This guy used to text me every day when they were,
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.260]   when they started their MMA thing telling me he was going to kill me.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.180]   Like legitimately death threats?
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.380]   Legitimately going to kill me.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.300]   You punk motherfucker, I'm going to fucking kill you. You don't understand who I am and
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.540]   what I've done and this and that. I think this guy would get drunk or do drugs every night or
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.580]   whatever his deal was. This guy would call me, text me and threaten my life every day. I used to go
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.540]   fuck you and this and that.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.420]   You said fuck you.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.980]   Oh yeah. Especially back then.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.740]   But yeah, but I mean, this is the type of shit that went on in the early days. This guy,
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.420]   this guy who was one of the owners of affliction was like one of the, you know, not a good human.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.540]   Let's put it that way.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.620]   What about the business side of it? It's tough to make money in this business.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:03.540]   Yeah. We weren't making money. So, you know, trying to build this thing, corrupt,
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:10.820]   corrupt the guys that work for in demand pay-per-view at the time.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:17.860]   We're not good dudes, you know, and that thing was a fucking total monopoly. God,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.580]   I wish I could remember his name right now. He used to run in demand and he was a fucking bad guy.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.860]   Then he, then he comes over and starts running direct TV who we always had a great relationship
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:33.700]   with. And he's the reason we left direct TV and said, fuck it. We'll just go streaming then.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.940]   Yeah. I don't remember his name. I'd have to ask Lorenzo.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.860]   So in general, just in this whole space, there's a lot of shady people.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:47.540]   Everybody you deal with is dealing with a lot of, a lot of, a lot of different forces. And your,
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:54.260]   your hands are in a lot of different businesses, uh, you know, from the venue business to the
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:23:00.740]   merchandise business to the video game business, uh, the pay-per-view business, you know, the list
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.860]   goes on and on of all the different types of the production business of all these different,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:12.500]   you know, when I first started this, I, uh, we had a production team that was the production team
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.620]   that was in it before we bought it. So there was this, there was this incident with Phil Barone,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:26.020]   where Phil Barone, we did an interview with him and Barone flips out in the interview when they're
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:32.260]   interviewing them and goes crazy. And I thought it was awesome. So I'm like, we're going to leave
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.020]   this in. We're going to leave this interview in. And the production guys were arguing with me.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.260]   They're like, we can't leave this in. This is totally unprofessional. And I said, I don't give
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.660]   a shit. This is, this is what we're doing. We're going to, we're going to do this and clip it like
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.100]   this and do it like that. We're sitting in the venue that night and I lean over to Lorenzo cause
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.580]   the fight's coming up. I go, wait, do you see this fucking interview with Barone? They didn't
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:00.900]   fucking do it. They didn't do it. These guys were guys that were freelance guys that work for show
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.540]   time at the time or one of the, something like that. I literally went, got up from my fucking
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.340]   seat, went back there, kicked the fucking door of the truck open. And I said, you motherfuckers,
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.780]   you ever do that again and I'll fire every fucking one of you. Let's just put it this way.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.260]   I ended up firing every one of them anyway and going with a whole new crew. But these were the
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:23.620]   type of things that early on, you know, there's so much stuff. I mean, I could sit here for fucking
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.580]   three days and walk you through all the stuff that used to go on back in those days. But it was the
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.460]   Wild Wild West, man. But how'd you figure out, how'd you know how to deal with all this mess?
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.980]   First of all, to fire people, to fire people that aren't doing a good job, all of that,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.740]   like how to be a leader, how to be-
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.940]   Well, that's the thing too. I mean-
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:40.580]   Business leader.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:46.820]   Getting it in the early days, there was two employees, me and another girl that worked for
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:52.020]   me, for my company before I started doing this. And then we slowly started to bring people on and
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.180]   you start to build a team. Then before you know it, we had 10 people. I mean, we used to do our
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.500]   Christmas parties back then too. There'd be eight to 10 people at our Christmas party, you know?
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.780]   But a lot of it is you learn as you go, you know? You know what me and the Fertittas knew about
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.100]   production when we bought this UFC? We had like, I want to say we had two or three weeks to pull
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:18.020]   off an event. This is what we knew about production. Jack shit. So we had to dive in and we had to
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.660]   learn it. We had to figure it out and we knew what we wanted. We knew what we liked. We knew
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:30.260]   what we were looking for. It's just about building a good team. And I think that's one of the things,
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:37.300]   if you want to talk about what I've accomplished in the last 25 years of my life, I've been really
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.700]   good at building teams. Already have a vision of what you want the final thing to look like
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.140]   and then build a team that can bring that to life. 100%. Well, you have to have the vision.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:56.020]   Without the vision, there's nothing. So that's sort of what I do. I am the vision part of this
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:02.420]   thing. We're going to open a PI in Mexico. We're going to do this. We're going to do that, you
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:11.300]   know? And then you build the team to come in and help execute. A lot of people that do fighting
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:18.500]   promotions fail. You succeeded against long odds. What's the secret to your success? If you were
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.340]   just looking back over the years. Well, the secret to success, I would say, first of all, is
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:30.980]   passion and consistency. You have to love what you do. You have to get up every day.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:39.940]   I get here every day at 9.30 in the morning. When we sold in 2016, a lot of people in the
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:46.660]   company made a lot of money and they all took off and they retired, right? Other than the Fertittas,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.420]   I made the most money. I'm still here. I get here at 9.30 every morning. Last night,
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:58.260]   I left here at 8.30. I don't know how late I'm going to be here tonight, but I love what I do.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:04.500]   We get up every day and grind. I work just as hard now as I did back then. The difference between
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.820]   back then and now is I don't have to do a bunch of the shit that I don't really like to do,
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.260]   like budget meetings. I don't like budget meetings. I sat through enough fucking budget
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:22.260]   meetings. Horrible budget meetings. Horrible. We're losing millions of dollars a year and I'm
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:28.580]   in these budget meetings. I get to pick and choose what I do these days. Back in the early days,
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.500]   you don't get to pick and choose. You have to be involved in everything.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.820]   Yeah. Cost. You're just looking at cost.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:41.860]   100%. You literally go through line by line every fucking number in the company and where did the
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:52.020]   money go and how can we save costs? How can we do this better? They are brutal and they're multiple
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.100]   times a week. Probably helps to deeply appreciate how much the shit costs though.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.500]   100%. Well, you have to know that. In the early days, when you start your business,
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:08.340]   you have these people who, when I hear them say, "You know what? I want to work for myself. I want
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:15.300]   to create my own schedule and I want to do all the..." If that's your thought process going into
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.540]   it, you're never going to be successful. You have to pay attention to every single detail of the
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.940]   business early on. You're involved in everything. There's no days off. There's no birthdays. There's
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.180]   no fucking Christmas. There's none of that shit. I literally moved the birth of my second son
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.300]   for a chocolate elf fight. We had a chocolate elf fight coming up and they're like, "Yeah,
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.940]   your son's going to be born on this date." I'm like, "Yeah, that's not going to work.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:43.060]   We're going to have to take him earlier." They literally gave my wife a C-section and took my
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.900]   son early. You're all in.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.860]   All in, yeah.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.620]   The fascinating thing, like you said, you've said that you could care less about money.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.420]   You're doing this for the love of it.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   I was doing this when I was broke and I'm doing this now when I'm not broke. I'm doing this
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:08.260]   because I love it. I feel like there's so much more to do. This is truly my passion in life.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.060]   It's like the sphere. We're doing the sphere. Why? Why would I do the sphere? It's going to
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:19.620]   cost me a bunch of money. It's really challenging. Most people think it can't be pulled off.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.700]   You're looking at weird angles, different things going on inside other than the fight
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.780]   and all this other stuff. I'm doing it because it's awesome and it's challenging and it's hard.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   I think that if anybody can do it right, it's us. Why not take that challenge?
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.660]   It's actually why I'm here. I'm going to the sphere for the first time because I'm
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.860]   hanging out with Darren Aronofsky who put together the thing that's in there now.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.740]   I can't believe you're thinking of... I don't know how you're going to solve that puzzle.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.940]   There's many puzzles to solve for this one. Many puzzles.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:59.140]   Can you speak to that? What are interesting challenges that you're encountering?
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:05.620]   Yeah. There's a lot. You have the octagon and then behind it is the world's biggest screen
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:12.900]   ever. What is the theme? How do you program it? First of all, it's super expensive to shoot
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:22.900]   the format for the sphere angles we were talking about today. I just had a big meeting today
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:31.140]   about the sphere this afternoon and making sure that all my departments, all the details that I
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:38.340]   want all start to come together here in the next two weeks. I want the creative, the commercial.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:44.100]   I have some goals. I will tell people as we get closer what I'm looking to achieve
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.900]   with this other than putting on one of the greatest, most unique sporting events of all time
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.020]   and probably the greatest combat sporting event of all time.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:59.300]   But yeah, there's challenges. There's a laundry list of challenges for this thing and not to
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:05.380]   mention the fact that it's on a Mexican Independence Day and we're going to weave in
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:12.100]   the whole history of combat in Mexico into this event.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.860]   But the production, this is hilarious because you were just talking about knowing nothing about
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.900]   production so many years ago. And now tackling the sphere.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.500]   The hardest production effort-
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.740]   Ever.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.060]   And that will be live?
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.540]   It'll be live. It'll be live on pay-per-view. It'll be live in the arena and it will also
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.980]   be in movie theaters.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:36.820]   Nice. So there'll be a, it'll be shown, will be shown at the sphere later too? Like will you try
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.060]   to create an experience?
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.740]   ESPN is doing a doc on it.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.300]   Nice.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.060]   The making of the sphere. Yeah.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.260]   Are you feeling good about it?
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.780]   Oh yeah. I feel incredible about it. I can't wait. It's going to be, it's going to be fun.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.860]   I can't wait to see how you solve the puzzle.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.740]   Thank you.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.620]   Another guy that I feel like could care less about the money is Joe Rogan.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.620]   How important is he to the UFC, to the rise of the UFC? And what in general do you love about Joe?
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:08.340]   It's a fact. He doesn't care about money. And he did the first 13 shows for free for us.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.300]   You know what I mean? That was at a time when we were hurting and he's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:16.980]   You want me to do the commentary? You're saying that I get to sit in the best seat in the house
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.300]   and watch these fights for free? Yeah, I'm in."
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:28.340]   And then obviously when we turned things around, we made it up to Joe. But Joe is
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.980]   one of the things that I loved early on about... So I'll tell you the story. So we buy the UFC.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:41.060]   They're based in New York. We're moving the corporate offices to Vegas. So I have to fly
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:48.180]   out to New York, go into the offices and start going through everything and figuring out what
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:53.380]   needs to come back to Vegas and what we can just throw away. So they literally had a VHS machine
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:33:00.020]   and a TV and there were a million tapes in this place, man. So I didn't know what tapes were...
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.020]   These definitely we have to keep or these we don't need. So I had to sit there and go through
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:09.780]   every single tape. And I popped in a tape and there was an interview on the Ivory Keenan Wayans show,
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.380]   right? The oldest Wayans brother and he had a talk show at the time. And he had Joe Rogan,
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:21.300]   the guy from Fear Factor on the show. And he was promoting Fear Factor, but all he
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:29.540]   would talk about was UFC. And he was talking about how people think that these guys in the
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:35.620]   martial arts movies are tough and could do it. And he was talking about what UFC fighters would do to
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:41.620]   these martial arts guys if they ever got their hands on them. And I was like, "This is exactly
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:49.860]   what I need. A guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and knows the sport inside and out,
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:54.420]   but more importantly, is super passionate about it and loves it." So when you see Joe
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:59.620]   Rogan on camera, and I was talking about the paid dock talking heads that they had in HBO Boxing
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:05.860]   that were terrible. Joe Rogan does not come off as a paid talking head. He comes off as a guy who
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:14.980]   loves this. And so early on, no media would cover us. So I had to buy my way onto radio.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:21.300]   So we'd do these radio tours, right? And they would drop us in. You'd have to get up at 3.30
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.540]   in the morning in Vegas on the West Coast. And they, 'cause they're at 6.30 in the morning in
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.420]   New York and Boston and Florida and all these other places. So they drop you into these markets
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:39.140]   to do radio, right? And the fighters were horrible at it. Fighters getting up at 3.30 in the morning,
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:45.700]   especially leading up to a fight, never good. They sound like they're tired, they act like
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.660]   they're tired, and they definitely act like they don't wanna be on there. And it's bad radio.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:56.180]   What you can't have is bad radio. So the only two people that could pull off these radio tours
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:03.460]   were me and Joe Rogan. So me and Joe Rogan would alternate doing these radio tours all over the
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.020]   country.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.580]   Just talking about fighting, talking about what this whole thing is,
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.580]   like getting people excited.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.780]   Two guys that are really into it and passionate about it and love it and can... And it's one of
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.900]   the things about Rogan too. When early on, nobody understood the ground game. Joe Rogan would walk
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.860]   you through what was happening literally before it would happen. He would tell you the setup,
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.140]   what was gonna come next and everything. He'd just absolutely articulate it perfectly,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:37.620]   brilliantly, and people at home started to understand. And the impact that Joe Rogan has had
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:44.740]   and continues to have on this sport is immeasurable. He's the biggest podcaster in the
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:54.420]   world. And he is on the UFC pay-per-views 14 times a year, and he's always talking about the sport.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.860]   It's immeasurable what this guy has done for this company and the sport.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.100]   Yeah, still to this day. I'll have dinner with him offline. He'll just talk fighting.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.140]   Just loves it.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.020]   It's true.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.460]   Loves every aspect of it.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.220]   Yeah. Joe Rogan is one of those guys. I saw that early on when...
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:21.300]   Why would you go after the Fear Factor guy to be such a key component to not only the company,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.820]   but to the sport? I saw it in the fucking interview on Ivory King and Wayans.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:34.500]   I value loyalty a lot. And I remember there was a moment, not too long ago, maybe a year ago,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   when I was sitting with Joe and he had a phone call with you. Joe was getting canceled for
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:48.260]   something. And they didn't want him commentating the fights. And you on the phone offered your
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:57.220]   resignation over this. I got teary-eyed over that. That's such a... You're a good man.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.420]   Thank you.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.020]   That was powerful.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:07.540]   Anybody who is with me, has been with me, knows. When you're with me, you're with me.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:13.380]   It's a two-way street. It's not a one-way street. I'm not one of these guys that is
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:19.700]   going to roll over. It's like going through COVID. I wasn't laying any of these people...
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.460]   Some of these people have been with me for 20 years. We're going to lay them off?
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:35.140]   This motherfucker will burn. Burn before I would do that to my people. None of that type of stuff
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:41.140]   is ever going to happen while I'm here. I can't say what's going to happen when I leave, but when
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.900]   I'm here, the people who were with me and have been with me, they know exactly what's up. And
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:54.340]   Joe knows what's up. And again, it's a two-way street. Joe Rogan has been very loyal to me,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.180]   and I am very loyal to Joe Rogan.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:03.060]   Lorenzo, another guy you have close friendship with. You seem to have been extremely effective
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.380]   together as business partners. What's the magic behind that? How can you explain that?
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.580]   I love him. Lorenzo and I work really well together because we have two different personalities.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:20.100]   I'm the guy that always... I'm going here. Lorenzo is always here. You could walk in a room and say,
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:28.740]   "Lorenzo, you just lost $10 million. Lorenzo, you just won $10 million." It never changes. And I'm
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:35.700]   a guy that goes like this. We almost balance each other out. There's a lot of things that he's
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.220]   really fucking good at, and there's a lot of things that I'm really fucking good at,
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.780]   and they're both on the opposite sides of the spectrum.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.420]   So that level-headed thing was useful when the UFC was losing money, and
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.580]   it was unknown whether it's going to survive those low points.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.740]   100%. What's incredible, when you think of the story of the UFC,
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:39:02.340]   at the time, the casino business was cranking, right? And Station Casinos was killing it.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:08.180]   And Stations, their money from Stations is what was funding the UFC.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:19.300]   Then in the '08-'09 crash, the UFC was killing it in '08 and '09, and the casino businesses were
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:25.460]   hurting. So timing on everything, the way that it all worked out, couldn't have worked out better
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:34.180]   for them, and obviously for all of us. When you think about the UFC, and how big it is,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.940]   and how far it reaches, and how many people it touches, the Fertitta brothers made a $2 million
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:49.220]   investment, then put in another $44 million, and look at how many lives that investment has changed
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:57.540]   over the last 25 years. It's fascinating. - And it's also crazy, just forget the
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:03.460]   business of it, just the effect it has on the history of humanity, in terms of this is what
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.980]   we do. We're descendants of apes that fight, and this is like the organizations that catalyze the
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:14.260]   innovation in how we fight. It's crazy. It created a whole new sport.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:20.740]   - That people all over the world participate in now. Literally, there isn't a place on earth
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:27.380]   that we can't get a fighter from now. - You said in the UFC 299 post-fight
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:34.660]   press conference that sometimes fighters might complain that they get matched up on even odds,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:40.420]   but that's actually when legends are made. I think you gave Dustin Poirier as an example.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.140]   Can you elaborate on that a little bit? What makes a legend? What makes greatness in a fight?
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:52.340]   - So behind the scenes, fighters are a very paranoid bunch of people. They're very paranoid.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:41:00.740]   And there's been this theme with fighters where they're trying to get me beat, right?
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:09.940]   We don't determine who wins and loses. If we did, we'd be the WWE, okay? You do.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:15.460]   I'm the bells and whistles guy. I make sure that as many people that we can possibly let know that
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.020]   you're fighting on Saturday know that you're fighting on Saturday, who you are, who you're
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.700]   going against, and why people should give a shit. That's what I do, right? Then the night you show
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.260]   up, I put on the best live event that I possibly can, and I put on the best television show that
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:39.940]   I possibly can. Once that door shuts, it's all up to you. You determine whether you lose or not.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:48.660]   And if you get into a position where you become so paranoid that you think that the powers that
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:42:03.380]   be here are against you, and you try to steer yourself away from certain fights, and that's one
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.940]   of the big things that happens in these other organizations. In these other organizations,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.740]   the inmates run the asylum, right? So if they don't want to fight bad enough, these other
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:20.660]   companies don't push, and they don't do this, and they don't. We put on the best possible match-ups
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:29.140]   that we can make. And in this business, you might be an older fighter, but if you're still ranked
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:36.420]   in the top 10, there's young guys coming for you, killers. Young killers are coming out,
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:43.620]   and they want your position, right? So you being the veteran that you are, have to prepare yourself
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:50.980]   to go in. And everybody was saying when we made that fight with St. Denis that Poirier was in big
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:43:00.340]   trouble. That's awesome. That helps build the entire thing. And then Poirier goes out and does
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:07.620]   what he did that night. That's what makes fucking legends. - It's interesting, because sometimes
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.500]   being the underdog is a really good thing for the long-term story of who you are as a fighter.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.660]   - Especially when you're a big name, and a name that people recognize, and a name that people
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:25.540]   know. And they're like, "Oh man, I remember Israel Adesanya and Sean Strickland. 100 out of 100
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:33.060]   people knew for a fact that Israel was gonna win that fight. And here comes Strickland." And we
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:38.420]   could go on for days with this, you know what I mean? That is what creates legendary moments,
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:44.100]   legendary fights, and it's what builds stars and legends. - I mean, arguably, Conor McGregor
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.180]   with Jose Aldo. - Yep. Conor McGregor with a bunch of people in the beginning. People said
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.820]   he couldn't wrestle. People said he wouldn't be able to defend a takedown, blah, blah, blah. Nate
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:59.540]   Diaz against Conor McGregor, you know what I mean? - And Conor McGregor against Khabib, underdog
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:08.420]   probably. But if you won, there's an opportunity to win. If you won, that's the legend for me. He's
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.100]   now in the conversation with the greatest of all time without argument. - And if you look at the
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:18.740]   way that Khabib ran through so many people, Conor hung in there, you know. - Yeah, it could've been.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.340]   - And made a fight of it. - It could've been. What do you think about that matchup? It's one
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:28.980]   of the great matchups that you've made, Conor McGregor versus Khabib. - Yeah, I mean, at the
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:38.020]   time, I was incredibly criticized for putting together the spot that had the scene with the
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.300]   bus in it. - Yeah. - You know how the fucking media is, but they were saying that I was pandering to
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:49.460]   the, you know, to the violence that happened. I'm telling you a story. Telling you a story
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:58.420]   of how we got here and how big this fight is and how bad the blood is between these guys.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:06.100]   And I mean, I think that's what we do the best job at is telling the fucking stories of why.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:16.420]   We go into Monday, it's fight week. We got a whole list of things that we do fight week, right? And
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:21.140]   then you get right down to the press conference on Thursday, the weigh-ins on Friday, and then
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:27.460]   the fights on Saturday. Now my people fly back home, they go to bed on Sunday night, and it's
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:33.620]   crown hog day. We wake up again on Monday and it starts all over again. Every weekend, every Saturday
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:40.740]   for a year. So there's lots of stories that need to be told. There's lots of, when you think about
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:47.780]   what I compete with, whatever takes your attention on a Saturday night is my competitor. - So you're
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:52.580]   always trying to build a foundation for great stories. And like, if the fighters step up,
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:57.620]   they step up and they can together create greatness. - That's it. That's exactly right. So
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.460]   when we are online, like when you get to the UFC, I mean, you just saw it with MVP,
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:08.500]   you're gonna see it with Kayla Harrison and so many others that have come from other organizations
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:15.540]   and they get here, they notice immediately the difference between fighting here and fighting
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:20.900]   wherever they were before. It's not even comparable to the impact it has on you when
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:25.700]   you leave whatever organization you're with and you come to the UFC. And I think that it
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:33.460]   gives them a sense of, holy shit, I can really, I mean, MVP, when he came, I mean, there were
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:39.300]   probably more people at the press conference than any fight he'd ever fought in Bellator,
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:45.940]   you know what I mean? And you feel that energy and you feel the difference of the impact of being
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.420]   here. And I think it takes a lot of these guys to another level. - Yeah, just the aura of it,
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.140]   like this is where you're supposed to step up. Yeah, it's the way people feel about TED Talks,
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.540]   giving lectures. This is your moment, you get 15 minutes and this, you better
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:04.980]   say some interesting shit. And Kayla Harrison, by the way, is a badass. I can't wait to see
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.340]   what happens there. - She was walking around like this sleeveless shirt the night of the fights and
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:14.180]   holy shit. She is jacked, man. It's crazy. - Two-time Olympic gold medalist. You don't
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:19.460]   fuck with those people. You win a medal, you're made of something special. - So true. Especially
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.420]   in Judo. - Yeah, especially in American Judo, where you don't have many training partners that
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.660]   are great. - That's what I'm saying. - So you better fucking work for it. Ridiculous question,
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.980]   but who is in the conversation for the greatest of all time? - Jon Jones. - So you've talked about
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:40.820]   Jon Jones, but what are the metrics involved here? - He's never been beat. He destroyed everybody at
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:47.860]   Light Heavyweight, which at the time was the toughest weight class in the company, in the
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:56.740]   sport. And then I moved up to Heavyweight, won easily at Heavyweight. And when you look at a guy
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:04.100]   and you look at what he was doing outside the Octagon at the same time, which shouldn't be
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:11.780]   part of it, shouldn't be part of the equation, but when you do, wow. Jon Jones, there's no debate.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:17.300]   Nobody can debate who's the greatest of all time. It's absolutely positively Jon Jones.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:22.660]   He's never lost. He's never been beaten in the Octagon, ever. - So that's one of the metrics,
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:32.420]   like pure, sheer dominance. But there's others, right? Losing sometimes is a catalyst for
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:40.980]   greatness. - I don't disagree. But when you've never lost, right? You've never lost. We've never
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:49.700]   found somebody. And the other thing is that you have to factor into is longevity. How long he's,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:54.100]   'cause sometimes with a lot of these guys, the sport passes them by. You get younger guys that
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:49:00.660]   are faster, this, that, and the sport evolves. Nobody's been able to beat Jon Jones. Oh, and
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:07.060]   the other thing that you measure is when you said dominance, it's true. If you're this guy that has
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:11.380]   unbelievable power, and you're just going in, you're just fucking knocking everybody out. And
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:17.060]   nobody's ever pulled you into the deep water before. That was when my opinion of Jon Jones
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:22.260]   started to change. Gustafson took him into the deep water. Gustafson hit him with some shit he'd
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:29.060]   never been hit with. Gustafson tested him and put Jon Jones in a place where, I bet if you sat down
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:34.340]   and interviewed Jon Jones, going into the deep rounds of that, Jon Jones thought he was gonna
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.620]   die. You know what I'm saying? And he's willing to go there.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:43.940]   And he kept going. He was willing, willing to do whatever it took to win that fight.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:48.180]   And it breaks my heart because he beat DC, and DC is one of the greatest of all time.
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:53.460]   That's the thing too. And I believe that DC doesn't get the credit he deserves because of
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.820]   the Jon Jones thing. When you look at DC and what he's accomplished, right? And Jon Jones beat him
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:05.380]   twice. It's undeniable. You can hate all you want. Jon Jones was the greatest of all time.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.500]   - Do you think Habib was tested enough?
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:14.180]   - I think that Habib had the potential to be in the running for that. He just didn't stick
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:20.580]   around a lot. First of all, he had injuries that, you know, he should have been where he got a lot
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:25.540]   sooner had he not had the injuries that he had and the setbacks in his career. But there's no doubt,
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.820]   Habib is one of the all-time greats. - What's the good, the bad, and the ugly
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.140]   of your relationship with Conor? - There's literally no ugly. Conor
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:40.340]   McGregor has been an incredible partner to work with. Everybody thinks that Conor... If Conor
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.260]   showed up to things on time, there wouldn't be one fucking bad thing I could say about Conor.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.700]   You know what I mean? - Only being late.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.580]   - If you fucking said, you put a gun to my fucking head, right? And said, "Don't lie,
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:55.540]   motherfucker. Tell me all the bad things about Conor McGregor." I'd say the guy doesn't show
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.460]   up on time. That's it. - That's it.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:01.380]   - If Conor McGregor showed up to shit on time, and sometimes he does, sometimes he does,
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.980]   he's been a great partner. If you look at what a huge superstar he became,
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.540]   the fights that he was involved in, let me tell you what Conor McGregor never did.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.740]   We never walked in a room and said, "Conor, this guy just fell out. We want you to fight this guy."
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   And he was like, "No way. I'm not taking this fucking risk. I'm at this point in my career
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:28.020]   where my money, my this, my that." He was like, "Fuck it. Let's do it." He'd always say, "Let's do
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.820]   it." The other thing that Conor McGregor never did, no matter how big he was or whatever it was,
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.340]   when we were heading into a fight, "Oh, Conor, this guy just fell out. Aldo fell out. We're
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:42.260]   looking for another. Yeah, I'll do it, but I'm going to need another fucking $200,000. I'm going
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.740]   to need another million dollars. I'm going to..." Conor McGregor never did that kind of chicken
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:53.700]   shit bullshit kind of stuff. He never did any of that. Conor was as solid a guy as you could
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:52:00.100]   possibly work with. Just fuck it, I'll do it. I'll do it. Literally, there's actually a scene,
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.980]   because we were filming something. I don't know if it was embedded or what we were filming at the
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:07.780]   time. Me and Lorenzo walk into his house that he rented here in Vegas, and I'm pretty sure it was
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.020]   when Aldo fell out. And we're telling him this, that, and we're looking at some options. He says,
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.860]   "I'm going to the gym. When I'm done working out, let me know." He just woke up out of bed. He's in
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.260]   his fucking underwear. And he gets hit with this. And he's like, "All right, I'm going to the gym.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:28.820]   Let me know when I get out who I'm fighting." Doesn't care. Doesn't want to know. Doesn't
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:37.220]   want any more money. Nothing. Fucking shows up and he delivers. Yeah. So Conor has been incredibly
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:44.340]   successful. He's made a lot of money. And he's had his ups and downs outside and inside the octagon.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:51.140]   But as for a guy who was on the dole and was a plumber, he's actually a really smart businessman.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.220]   He's been one of the best partners that I've ever had in the history of the sport.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.460]   And an important part of the history of the UFC.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:57.780]   Big.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.100]   He opened it up to all kinds of new eyes.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:10.260]   He literally set Europe, Australia, Canada, and many other parts of the world on fire, man. He
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:15.780]   was our first legit megastar.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:20.900]   And I personally think he doesn't get enough credit for just how good he was as a fighter.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.180]   People love to talk shit about Conor. I suppose that's part of his magic.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:29.940]   But it comes with success. When you're successful, there's always people out there that are going to
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:37.700]   talk shit. You always have a bunch of know nothing, do nothing fucking losers that love to talk shit.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.460]   You think if you were to do it all over again, Habib is the right matchup?
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:47.700]   Yeah. Listen, the thing that you can't do is avoid matchups. You know what I mean? This
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.540]   is what we're talking about. When you talk about being a legend, Conor McGregor needed Habib.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:59.380]   Habib needed Conor McGregor. You can hate each other as much as you want,
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:06.820]   but you have to fight these other legendary bad motherfuckers to yourself become a legend.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:13.220]   I mean, it's like John Jones needed Cyril Gunn, right? And Cyril Gunn needed John Jones because
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:19.140]   if Cyril could have beat John, the first guy, if anybody can ever figure it out and beat John Jones,
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:26.500]   it's a big deal. And it's almost like your obligation as a fighter, right? And when you
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:31.620]   think about John Jones became who he is today, and the reason I'm sitting here telling you how great
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:38.900]   he is, because all these other guys gave him the opportunity to beat them, right? Or they beat John.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:46.020]   It's all about giving these other guys the opportunity. Saint Denis, right? Poirier gave
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:51.220]   him the opportunity to come in and beat him. That's how this all works.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.260]   - It's the two of them together, the two fighters together.
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:59.780]   - You have to have them both. Listen, I could line up a bunch of no-name bums
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.420]   that John Jones could run through. That's what they do in all the other organizations, right?
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.460]   We would have nothing to fucking talk about right now.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:12.820]   - That's why, luckily, a perfect record in the UFC is not as important as who you fought,
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.220]   how you fought. - But when you have a perfect
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:25.300]   record in the UFC, holy shit, right? When you can have a perfect record in the UFC,
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.980]   you are absolutely one of the most special athletes on planet Earth.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:36.820]   - You and Trump are friends. I just talked to Ivanka last night about her experience
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:42.260]   in the Miami event. She loves it. She's training too. You were talking about getting girls to
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.540]   train. She's training too. - And the kids are training, yeah. Her father's
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:51.060]   the biggest fucking fight fan on the planet. Calls me all the time to talk about the fights.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:59.460]   Don Jr. said that I'm like the only guy on Earth that he bros out with. It's funny when you talk
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:06.820]   about how powerful fighting is, right? This last Miami event, the president of Ecuador and the
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:17.220]   president of Spain both posted about the fights, right? Khabib beat Conor. Putin was on FaceTime
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:23.940]   before he even made it to the locker room. Trump, sitting president, ex-president, watching all the
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:29.140]   fights, calling, wants to talk about the fights. Valentina Shevchenko, every time she goes home,
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.860]   she meets with the president of the country. The list goes on and on and on. The most powerful,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:39.060]   Elon Musk, Zuckerberg. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. The most powerful people in the
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:43.300]   world are all obsessed with fighting. - When did you first discover that
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:49.060]   Trump loves fighting? - So I first discovered that Trump was a big fight fan. Obviously,
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:52.980]   you saw him part of all the big... You're talking about how big boxing fans we were.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.460]   He was a part of all the big fights back then. But when we first bought the UFC,
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:05.140]   this thing was so bad, venues didn't even want us. And we ended up doing our first event in Atlantic
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.580]   City at the Trump Taj Mahal. Now, think about this. At that time, Trump brand here, UFC brand,
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:18.500]   I mean, I can't go low enough. And he had us at his venue two times back to back,
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.740]   showed up for the first fight of the night, and stayed till the last fight of the night.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:29.540]   Then after that, any good thing that would ever happen to me in my career, Trump would reach out,
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.780]   whether it was we were on the front page of the New York Times at one time, and he said,
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:38.260]   "Congratulations, Dana. I always knew you guys were gonna do it." Little things like that,
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:43.220]   but that are big things and mean a lot, especially coming from a guy like him.
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.340]   - So he saw something in you, like this is gonna be...
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:55.140]   - 100%. He definitely saw it. And then comes '15, '16, whenever it was, I don't remember.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:58:03.780]   But he called me and he said, "Listen, if you don't wanna do this, I completely understand.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.860]   But I would be honored if you would speak at the National Republican Convention for me."
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:14.980]   And I'm not a very political guy, you know what I mean? And everybody told me not to do it. Do not
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:23.140]   do this. But I was like, "Why would I not do this? This guy's been great to me, and I did it."
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:29.620]   And our relationship is just like, you know what I mean? I consider Donald Trump to be one of my
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.260]   very, very good friends. - Any favorite stories?
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:39.860]   - I mean, there's so many stories. I mean, once he won the election, I'd be at work,
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:46.420]   and I'd be down the hall, was in the matchmaking room or whatever, and my secretary would tell,
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.340]   "The President's on the phone." Fucking come running down the hallway and grab the phone,
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.420]   and he'd wanna talk about the fight that was coming up or the fight that happened.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:00.260]   Or I'd be in my car, and I'd answer the phone, and it's like, "Hi, this is the White House. We
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:05.780]   have the President of the United States on the phone." That's a trip when that first starts
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   happening. And then just to sum him up, this is the kind of guy that, you wanna talk about a
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:23.460]   fighter? This is the most resilient human being I've ever met. If you see the shit that this guy's
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:31.940]   going through publicly every day, and I'll call him on the phone as a friend and be like, "Hey,
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:42.100]   you good? How you doing?" Unfazed, unfazed, like nothing's going on. And he'll start talking to me
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:47.060]   about this and that and all this other shit. One time, there's only been one time, I've never
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:56.500]   talked about this publicly, but one time I called him and he was not good. He was a mess, and I've
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:03.700]   never heard him like that, and I've never seen him like that when Ivana died. The only time I've
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:11.140]   ever seen him, fucked up. Obviously, as soon as I heard it, I reached out, and I have never.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.820]   Look at all the stuff that's gone on with Trump, all the bad stuff that they say,
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.620]   they're trying to attack him, they're trying to ruin him, unfazed. I called him that day,
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:24.100]   and it's the first time I've ever seen that guy busted up and not good.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:29.780]   But that says something that that's the only time that guy is walking through the fire.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.700]   He does not get rattled. He will walk through fire. He's an absolute savage.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.740]   You think he wins the presidential election?
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.180]   I don't know, man. It's going to depend on how this whole... Politics is the most dirtiest,
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.300]   scummiest thing on planet Earth, man, and who knows how this is all going to play out. It's
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:53.700]   all dirty, it's all ugly, and obviously, I'm rooting for him, and I'm behind him, and I hope
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.020]   he does, but we'll see.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.820]   What's dirtier, the fighting game in the early days or politics?
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:05.220]   There's nothing dirtier than politics. Nothing. There's literally nothing dirtier.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:05.940]   All right.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.860]   It is the dirtiest thing on planet Earth.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:12.340]   I just wanted to get that on record. Another guy who doesn't seem to be phased by the fire,
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:18.260]   I've gotten to know him, is Elon. I have to ask you, it's a bit of fun. You were a part of
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:24.020]   thinking about putting together Zuck versus Elon. I trained with both. I did a phone call
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:31.060]   with Elon and you when we were training on the mat. You really think that could have
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.020]   been a good fight?
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.940]   It would have been the biggest fight ever done.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.900]   The spectacle of it.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:43.940]   Two of the most powerful, wealthiest men in the world. Lots of guys talk shit, and go back and
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.580]   forth, and sue each other, and do all this. These two guys were literally talking about facing each
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:55.300]   other in the octagon and fighting. They're in a business that's looked at as geeky. You know what
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.700]   I mean? They're tech nerds. They're this, they're that. These are two dudes that were willing to
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:06.020]   throw down and fight. You know as well as I do. There's a lot of public speculation about this.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:12.420]   I was taking serious real time and working on this thing. I had projections. I had numbers.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.260]   I was looking at venues. I was on the phone with the fucking Colosseum in Italy.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.020]   You name it, I was in it. These guys were serious. This was something that was really
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:28.020]   going to happen. I'll tell you right now, in the short amount of time that it was going down,
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.100]   it was fun. I was having a blast with it.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.420]   What do you think about Tyson fighting Jake Paul?
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:43.540]   I love Mike Tyson. I'm not a fan of anybody fighting at our age, but he's a grown man
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:52.980]   obviously. He's going to do what he's going to do. At least I know. I talked to his wife a couple
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:59.380]   days ago. He's taking this serious and he's training for it. We'll see how it plays out.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.900]   Why do you think he fights though? What is that about? Is there a broader lesson there about
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.980]   fighters? About great fighters?
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.420]   I think that Mike Tyson is actually one of those unique guys who
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:17.140]   has crossed over. Any of these other boxers from his era, they have no way of making money other
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:23.780]   than fighting. Mike Tyson has made a lot of money outside of fighting. Tyson still has that aura.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:29.460]   You could be at a restaurant and he walks in and you're like, "Holy fuck, Mike Tyson's here." He
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:38.820]   still has that type of aura and energy in a room. He makes lots of money outside of the ring.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.460]   I think that he ends up getting these offers that he can't refuse.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:51.780]   You think it's financial? That's a good question to ask. You work with a lot of fighters. For how
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:57.940]   many of them is it about money and for how many is it about the fact, the pure love of fighting?
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:03.700]   Well, the guys that get into it for the right reason are the guys who get into it for greatness
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:10.820]   because you want to be the fucking best. When you're in it for that reason,
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:16.980]   you love it and you want to be looked at as the best ever and you have the talent,
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:22.420]   the money happens. Then you have other guys who get in. I believe I've dealt with fighters who
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:33.540]   just wanted to be famous and just wanted to make money. It is what it is. It's your life and you
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:38.340]   live it the way that you want and do your thing. The ones that are beloved are the guys who really
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.460]   want to be fucking great. They're the ones that are remembered. When you look at Tyson in his
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:49.140]   early years when he came up under Kosti Amato, he was a student of the game. He loved everything.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:56.820]   He became completely infatuated with the fight game. Then he became such a massive superstar,
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:01.940]   it's almost like the whole thing starts to turn on you. All the things that come at you at a young
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:08.020]   age and that kind of money. It's tough. It's tough to navigate and get through. You say something
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:13.700]   like that and people are like, "Oh, poor him. He had fucking $100 million and couldn't." At that
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.780]   age and with all the shit that people talk and all the things that you got to put up with and
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:23.540]   the fame, a lot of people deal with fame. Some people handle it really well and some people
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:32.420]   don't. The perfect example of that was Forrest Griffin and Stephen Bonner. They fought that
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:37.940]   unbelievable fight on The Ultimate Fighter. Everything blew up after that. Forrest dealt
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:43.220]   with fame really well and Stephen did not. That was a special fight.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:50.420]   Really was. What do you think attracted people to that fight? That was a big leap for the UFC.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.380]   It was everything.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.020]   It was everything.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:52.660]   It was everything.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.180]   Why do you think people loved that fight? What attracted people to that fight?
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.180]   Why did they change everything?
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.860]   Well, what happened that night is that the rest of the show was a disaster.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:08.660]   We had the co-main event and the main event. Diego Sanchez ran through Kenny Florian in seconds.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:15.060]   Oh my God, that was terrible. The fights that led up to that weren't anything to talk about either.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:21.940]   Then Stephen and Forrest got in there and just went toe-to-toe in this unbelievable
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:30.100]   slugfest live on free television when cable still mattered. What I heard was at the time,
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.300]   you had people picking up the phone going, "Are you watching this show?" The numbers just started
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:42.260]   climbing. Then you got a razor-thin decision, who's going to win? You got the crowd stomping
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.180]   their feet. It sounded like a train was going through the place and everybody's chanting,
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.660]   "One more round." Me and the Fertitta brothers get together and we talk,
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.500]   we're going to give them both contracts. We give them both contracts and the place erupts.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:03.460]   It couldn't have been a more perfect fight at the most perfect time. It all came together.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:10.340]   It's almost like this was meant to be. You know what I mean? We had so many problems
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:16.580]   with Spike TV at the time because halfway through the season, the president of the company got fired.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:23.700]   All the things that we thought we were going to get that year, we had this runaway hit show.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:29.300]   Normally at that time when you would see runaway hit shows, there'd be commercials,
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:35.700]   it'd be on billboards, it'd be on the side of buses in LA and New York. We got none of that.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.780]   We didn't even know if we were going to get a second season coming out of that.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:49.300]   When that fight was over, I swear to God, I was like, "I don't even give a fuck.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.340]   We're going to end up somewhere now after this fight." We didn't even make it out of the building
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:08:00.100]   that night. The Spike guys did the contract with us in the alley on a fucking napkin after the fight.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:04.340]   You already saw the magic of the fight itself. It counts.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:09.060]   Once that happened and all the shit. At that time, I didn't know what the ratings. It's not like we
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.420]   were streaming and we could see what we had. We had no idea, but I knew.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.220]   You just knew this was going to happen.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.020]   I knew.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:21.140]   What is it? It's just two people being willing to stand toe to toe and just go to war.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.580]   When you think about what was at stake, there was a car. Remember the Kia?
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.100]   The winner got a Kia, right?
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.820]   I don't even remember that.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.580]   That's what was the fucking, right?
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:38.100]   Steffen and Forrest, the will to win. They both wanted to win that fight so bad.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.700]   It was bigger than the Kia, probably.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:47.380]   Forrest drove that Kia to 200,000 miles. The biggest mistake Kia ever made was not doing
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.940]   a fucking commercial with Forrest Griffin about that car. Forrest Griffin loved that car so much,
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:57.940]   he drove it. I think he still has it. It's got 200,000 miles on it that car. You couldn't have
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:02.420]   a better fucking commercial than that. We reached out to him too. I said, "Kia should know about
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:08.260]   this." They fucking blew it. You know how those guys are in the business world. They don't fucking
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.300]   get anything.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.740]   Maybe it was about the Kia then.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:17.540]   It was about winning. They both wanted to win the Ultimate Fighter so bad. It's the Kia. It's the
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.180]   win. It's the contract you get, the whole thing.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:27.220]   But I think at that point, you even forget all of that when you're in there. You probably just,
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.820]   there's a primal thing where I'm not backing down.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:34.740]   They're both bad dudes. They were both real fighters at the end of the day. That's why
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.740]   the fight was so great. You know what I mean?
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:42.180]   Just throw all the caution to the wind and just fight. Those are some of the greatest
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:49.380]   moments in the FC2 when the technique is not, falls apart and you're just like, "Fuck it."
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.820]   It's because you're in those deep rounds. You've been through a war. Now it's all about heart and
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:59.060]   dog, who can dig deeper and who's got it and who wants it.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.180]   I mean, we all know when that moment happens in a fight, when you see that both of these
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:08.740]   guys are fucking exhausted. And for people that are watching this, people that don't
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:13.220]   know a lot of, everybody thinks they know a lot about fighting. 99.9% of the people out
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:18.100]   there don't know fucking jack shit about fighting or what it takes to do what these people do.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:24.420]   But when you get into those later rounds and fatigue sets in, and then fatigue makes you
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.220]   start to fucking doubt yourself. And then you start to wonder, "Can I even make it through
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.900]   the rest of this round?" And then you start to think, "Am I going to fucking die right now?"
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:39.780]   And these kids dig fucking deep. And they just, like you said, all the other shit flies out the
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:45.060]   window and now they're just on fucking autopilot to fight and win. Those are definitely the best
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.460]   fights you'll ever see in any combat sport. I mean, that saying is true. The exhaustion
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:55.940]   makes cowards of us all. I mean, there's something about, because I've competed a lot in jiu-jitsu,
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:02.820]   so there's the violence of being hit too. But even just exhaustion, it makes you question
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:09.620]   everything. So true. It just takes you to some weird place where your brain starts to think
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:15.860]   you're going to die for sure. Your brain starts to think, "Why am I doing this? All these excuses,
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:22.740]   all this stuff." And then the truly heroic action is to say, "Fuck it," in that moment,
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.300]   and just to get in there. When you think about these fights that you see in the UFC every fucking
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.820]   Saturday, when these men and women get to this point where they've been in a dogfight,
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:39.220]   yet they keep fucking going and you keep trying to win. You can't imagine what's going on inside
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:47.860]   their heads. Self-doubt and all these other things that come into play when exhaustion sets in and
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:52.820]   they fucking power through it. Yeah. Those moments, sometimes they don't have a glorious knockout at
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:00.980]   the end, but your decision in the third round or the fifth round to still keep pushing forward,
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:08.340]   not running. A hundred percent. That doesn't matter what happened. That is a person winning
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.540]   a battle over themselves. So true. It's so true, and it happens every fucking weekend.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.820]   It's so impressive. I say it all the time. The people that are involved in this sport
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:25.460]   are this much of the population. The people that make it to the top five are incredibly
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:33.060]   unique, special human beings, man. It's fucking awesome. You love gambling. I do.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:42.820]   What's the biggest win of your gambling career? Maybe psychologically, if not financially.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:49.300]   Well, two things. I won a million-dollar hand one night. It's happened one time.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:59.540]   A million-dollar hand one night at Nanlei Bay. Then one summer, I beat Caesars for 12 million
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:07.060]   throughout the summer. Throughout the summer. Yeah. Then I'm on a pretty good run right now,
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:14.180]   too. This is Blackjack. What's the biggest loss? Biggest loss was...
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:25.700]   I would call this the biggest loss for many different reasons. You live and you learn in
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:32.500]   life, and you figure things out as you go along. One night, I'm over at the Rio.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:41.300]   They got big suites over there. I go over there with some buddies, and we got one of the suites,
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.540]   and we have some dinner, and we start drinking. We're having some drinks at dinner, and blah,
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:53.780]   blah, blah. Starts to ramp up, having a good time. I make my way down to the Thai limit room. We
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:14:04.500]   start gambling. I continue to drink, having a blast. I end up leaving and going home that night,
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:11.620]   and I lost 80 grand. I wake up the next morning. I'm like, "Fuck. Those motherfuckers got me for
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:19.860]   80,000 last night." I'm at work the next day. The host over there calls me, and he says, "Hey, Dana,
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.580]   are you coming back? Do you still need the room that you guys had where you ate and all the shit
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:33.060]   you used to?" I said, "No, I don't need the room, but don't get too comfortable with my fucking 80
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.780]   grand. I'm coming back for it." Dead fucking silence on the other end of the phone. He's like,
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:45.700]   "Dana, you lost $3 million last night." I was like, "What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:54.820]   I only have a million and a half dollar credit line." He goes, "Yeah. You made us call the GM
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:00.820]   of the hotel, and you started calling him a fucking pussy, and dah, dah, dah, dah." I went,
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:06.180]   "Yeah. No, that sounds like something I would do. Yeah."
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.380]   So that's the real number.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:15.060]   That was the real number. Then there's been a lot of cases where people are in Vegas, and they're
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:22.900]   like, "Oh, I lost all this money, and they were giving me free drinks, and I drank too much,
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:29.700]   and I was taken advantage of." No, you stupid motherfucker. Man up. You got fucking drunk.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:39.780]   Alcohol is free, but you don't have to fucking drink it. You know what I mean? This was a huge
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:46.420]   learning lesson for me. So I never drank again when I was playing cards after that night.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.860]   Oh, damn.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:53.780]   But yeah, when you ask me, that's the one that stands out in my head the most as far as having
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:59.380]   a bad loss. Then, of course, I said, "Call the GM," and I started calling him a pussy at 3 o'clock
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.740]   in the morning. So that is something I would absolutely do.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:08.660]   How do you deal with those psychologically? When you gamble, maybe this applies to fighting too,
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:12.340]   do you love winning or hate losing more?
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:24.260]   They go hand in hand. So the way that I play is, I live in Vegas, so 2024 is a war for me.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:32.100]   I go to war in '24. All these nights that I play are little battles inside the war that I will
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:40.340]   fight in '24. Now, at the end of the year, we will tally up all these little battles and see where I
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:50.900]   stand on wins and losses. There's lots of talk out there about my gambling, places that I've been
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:17:00.980]   kicked out of and things like that. I do pretty well. I do pretty well, but it's what I like to
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:09.700]   do. I don't gamble in a way that I would ever hurt myself or hurt my family. I'm sure you've heard
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:15.220]   the Norm MacDonald stories. Norm MacDonald lost his entire personal wealth four times or something
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:22.740]   like that. Yeah, that's not going to happen to me. So you manage it, but just psychologically,
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:29.060]   you're able to be even-keeled. Yeah. So when I win, it's awesome. It's always great to win.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:35.940]   Winning is a great feeling in business, in sports, in life, and definitely in gambling.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:43.460]   Losing is never fun, but it's part of the game. You know what I mean? If you want to be in the
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:48.980]   game and it's sports, it's business or whatever, there's going to be wins and there's going to be
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:54.820]   losses. And you have to take them both in stride and you have to be able to, you know, there's a
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:18:02.740]   lot of people... When you gamble, right, and you lose and you go into a deep, dark depression,
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:09.140]   I've seen this with guys that get depressed and gambling isn't for you. If you are the type of
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:14.100]   person that's on social media and people say horrible things to you and you get depressed,
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:20.340]   you shouldn't be on social media. You know what I mean? These are all part of being in the game.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:24.980]   When you're in the fucking game, great things happen and really bad things happen. And you got
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:29.460]   to take it all in stride and you got to pick yourself up the next day, strap your fucking
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:33.380]   shoes back on and get out there and go to fucking war again. That's how it works.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.300]   That's some gogging shit right there. All right. I love that motivational speech.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:43.540]   It's the truth though. It's the truth though. Listen, every day when you get out of bed,
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:48.020]   life's standing right there to kick you in the fucking face, man. Could be anything. Could be
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:52.020]   you get up and you walk downstairs, you got a fucking flat tire and you're late for work and
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.540]   you got this and that. Life is going to throw all kinds of crazy shit at you, right? And you have
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:01.540]   to be ready for it and you got to fucking deal with it. You can't curl up into a ball. You can't
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:06.660]   run away from it. You can't hide. You have to take all this shit head on. You have to get up.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:11.620]   Every day when I get up out of bed, I strap up and I'm getting ready for fucking war because I know
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:15.460]   I'm coming in here. I know a bunch of bad shit's going to happen that I'm going to fucking deal
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:20.740]   with. And if that's not bad enough, when I finally get out of here, I'm probably going to go to the
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:26.500]   casino and I'm going to get into another fucking war. You know what I mean? I thrive in chaos.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:32.820]   I actually love chaos. Everybody talks about retiring. Fuck that shit. What am I going to
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.860]   do when I retire? What would I do? What would I, I liked, I like to go to war. I like to battle.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:43.460]   I like to win. Sometimes I lose, but then I have to come back from the loss and I love to build
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:51.300]   brands. I love to set short-term and long-term goals and then knock them all down. This is just
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:20:00.740]   the stuff that excites me. And whether it's business or gambling, I like being a fan of
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:07.780]   things too. I like live music. So when I find a band that I like, I get excited to go watch the
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.980]   band live or Celtics game. I love the fucking Boston Celtics and I love going to the games and
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.540]   watching them. This is the year. Hopefully we're going to fucking win it this year.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:22.260]   These are all things that make me happy and excite me in my life. And it's funny because
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:29.220]   there's this post that I post maybe three, four nights a week. I also love the city. I can't tell
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:34.740]   if the city of Las Vegas was built for me or I was built for this fucking city, but I love it.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:40.420]   And there's this turn on Summerlin Parkway, right? Every night and it's dark. And from there,
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:45.380]   you can see the entire fucking city and it's all fucking lights and it's badass. And I'm
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:52.340]   usually driving home after a fucking incredible day, right? This amazing day and this unbelievable
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:57.780]   fucking life that I have. And I have this just moment of gratitude. Every time I take that turn
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:03.300]   and I'm like, "God damn, I love this fucking city." And just every night when I go home,
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.100]   I'm just so happy and grateful for this life that I have.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:10.420]   So you're grateful, you're celebrating, even if the day is full of shit, full of problems,
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.780]   you have to solve all of this, you're still able to put that behind you?
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:21.140]   I love that too. I love problem solving. I love taking things that seem impossible.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:30.260]   What's been shit on more than this fucking company right here? Power Slap, right?
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:38.100]   This thing's a fucking beast. It's an absolute beast. In 13 months, that's the most successful
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.780]   thing I've ever been a part of. And I love every fucking minute of it, especially the negativity.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.140]   I love negativity.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.020]   So you almost feed on it. That's great. You're a build for it.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.060]   I eat that shit for fucking breakfast, man. I love it.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.820]   What's your favorite movie about Vegas? Casino?
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.460]   Yeah, it would have to be Casino. No doubt about it.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:04.740]   Do you ever see a movie that changed your life, that actually impacted your life in some way,
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:05.620]   shape or form?
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.420]   Probably.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:06.980]   Which one?
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:13.620]   That's a good question. I have to think. Well, I have a lot, a lot. Casino could be one of them,
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:21.220]   probably taught me about women. Forrest Gump, for me, it's a simple movie, but it was a really
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:27.940]   good movie to show. Because I've been really fortunate in my life, over and over and over,
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.740]   and I don't think I deserve any of it. So I just always felt like Forrest Gump. So when I finally
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:39.060]   saw it, it really connected with me. It was like, okay, this universe works in weird ways and stuff
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:43.860]   just materializes. And you just kind of be good to people, put that good karma out there and it
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.100]   happens for you. So that was a movie like that.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:52.420]   I'm actually very superstitious about that. I believe that what you put out, you get back.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:58.900]   And I believe that when you have, you should take care of other people and you should always try to
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:05.460]   bring people up with you and all that kind of stuff. But the movie that changed the whole
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:08.420]   trajectory of my life was Vision Quest.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.580]   Yeah. Well, yeah, that's a good one too. Yeah.
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:16.420]   Vision Quest, man. I fucking love that movie. It's basically, it's telling the story of a kid
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.580]   who really wasn't anybody in high school and nobody kind of knew who he was. He wasn't popular
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:26.180]   or any of that kind of shit. And he decided that that was the year that he was going to make his
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:31.460]   mark. And he was a good wrestler at 178 pounds, but he was going to move down to 160 something
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.700]   to take on the shoot, the scariest guy and the whatever. But there's all these little
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:41.540]   things in the movie that really lay out what life is all about.
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:48.100]   One of the parts is he's in a class and he's talking about, the teacher's talking about some
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:51.940]   poem. And he says, what does this poem mean to you? Well, this little girl's walking through
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:57.700]   the park and all the leaves are falling off the trees. And she realizes that she's going to die
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:04.660]   someday. And that a lot of people think they have all this time, so they fucking waste it.
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.580]   And they never go out and do what they really set out to do or accomplish or
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:12.900]   do anything great in their life. That's one meaning. Then he's got the guy that he works
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:17.300]   with at work. He's cutting weight and his nose is bleeding and all this shit. And this guy keeps
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.300]   going, why the fuck are you doing this? Pick that thing up and eat it like a fucking man.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.580]   This is ridiculous. I don't know why you're doing this to yourself, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:29.300]   So then when he meets the girl and he gets to the point where he feels like he wants to quit,
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:34.900]   right? Where does he go? He goes to that guy's fucking apartment because he knows when he shows
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:39.380]   up at this guy's apartment, he's going to go, yeah, fuck this shit. No, he went to work. He
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:44.500]   went to work to talk to him and he wasn't at work. He took the night off. So he shows up at the
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.580]   fucking house at the shitty little fucking apartment that the guy lives in. And the guy's
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.260]   putting his suit and tie on and shit. He's like, they said you called in sick. What's going on?
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:56.580]   He's like, well, yeah. Aren't you wrestling this guy tonight? And he's like, yeah, but why would
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.500]   you, you're going to get docked a night's pay and all this other shit. He says, you know what, man?
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:04.260]   Then it all gets laid out. I get the goosebumps even telling you this fucking part of the play
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:10.100]   speech. Yeah. What are you saying about, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucking cooking
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:15.700]   in an overnight hotel fucking thing. And I live in this shitty apartment. A human being can lift
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:20.260]   himself upside down and backwards and kick a ball into a fucking net. And the whole stadium goes
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:24.980]   crazy. And this guy runs around and I'm sitting here in my fucking apartment alone. And I start
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.220]   crying. Yeah. I start crying. So the guy who's been shitting on him the whole fucking time
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:34.260]   actually really respects him for what he's done and sees what this kid is capable of doing and
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:39.380]   all this shit. There's just this fucking movie spoke to me on so many different levels. And I
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:44.980]   think it's probably the most underrated movie of all time. When you really break down the meaning
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:49.700]   of what this movie is about. And, and, and, and it fucking really spoke to me. That's probably
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:56.580]   the greatest movie on combat one-on-one combat. I would agree ever made. I would agree. Yeah. And
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:02.100]   especially if you can really hear the messages that it's, that it's, that it's given you in
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.620]   this movie, it's, it's, it's excellent. You know, it's funny. They just did like the, and I saw this
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:14.180]   after the fact, which completely fucking pissed me off. They did like the 25 year or the 30 year
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.420]   thing. It was filmed in Spokane, Washington. They showed the movie at a movie theater there
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:22.500]   and the cast members came out and spoke about it. I would have fucking flown there for that.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:26.340]   Are you shitting me? I'd have been there in fucking 30 seconds to go up there and,
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.700]   and, and be a part of that. That, that movie literally changed my life.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.820]   Yeah. I suppose me too. It made me, uh, it made me want to wrestle. I mean,
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:39.460]   probably the reason I was, maybe it made me love fall in love with wrestling.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.940]   Well, you know, it's funny. I wasn't even into wrestling at all
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:46.420]   and I didn't have to be for that movie to. Yeah. It's the basic human story.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.500]   It's such a great movie. I mean, that's what fighting does.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:53.140]   It brings out the basic, like the, the, the humanity of a person really like if the,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   for the people that choose to step up and step in the ring and then chase greatness and actually do
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:03.380]   it from like against the long odds, that's why it's a beautiful game.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.300]   And it's so true. I mean, when you think about like, I'm 54 years old right now,
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:14.660]   like that, I mean, it just fucking flew by and, uh, you think when you're young,
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:19.620]   that you have all this time, you have no time. There's, there, there's no time. I mean,
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:26.180]   one of the, one of the quotes on the wall in the gym and there's, um, you know, there is no tomorrow
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.740]   from, from Rocky three, you know, there is no tomorrow. Fuck that shit.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.980]   Let's, let's get all this shit done today. Do you think about your death?
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:41.060]   I'm not, I'm not afraid of death, not even a little bit. I'm not afraid of it. Um,
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:45.620]   I don't know if that'll be the case when I'm facing it, you know, when I'm looking down the
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:51.540]   barrel of it, laying in a hospital bed somewhere. But for now, just squeezing as much as you can.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.420]   I literally, I don't even like to sleep. My life is so fucking awesome.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.620]   I don't even want to go to bed at night. I don't even want to go to sleep. I want to stay up.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:05.220]   I wish I could fucking do 24 hours and never have to sleep. That's how much I love my life.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:10.980]   What has watching thousands of fights over the years taught you about human nature, about us
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:15.700]   humans? I don't care what color you are, what country you come from or what language you speak.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:19.540]   We're all human beings. Fighting's in our DNA. We get it and we like it.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:25.780]   And it's true. Fighting is in our DNA. It's a part of who we are. And, uh, you know,
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:31.780]   no matter where you are, fight breaks out. It creates this fucking energy, this buzz,
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:37.940]   this sense of fear. I mean, a lot of different emotions happen in people when fights break out.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:43.060]   But one thing that, that, that is always the case. Everybody's watching, man. Everybody's
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:49.220]   fucking, all of their eyes are on the fight. I mean, we were just in Mexico. Fucking fight broke
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:55.540]   out like in the good seats, like right here with the seats that are super expensive. Insecurity
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:29:00.500]   never fucking came. Yeah. They just let these guys fight until they gassed out. Yeah. And then
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:04.980]   everybody put their chairs back together and sat back down and fucking, I literally got up from
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:10.820]   my table, walked over and was watching this fight at the fights. At the fights. Yeah. I mean,
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:16.900]   humans fight and humans love watching fighting. Absolutely. And that was my thought process going
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:23.060]   into buying the UFC. And I believe that this would work everywhere. And thank God we were right.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:28.900]   Well, Dana, thank you for bringing this very human thing of fighting the art of it,
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:34.260]   the science of it, the, the heroic stories, the vision quest stories of it all.
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:34.660]   Boom.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.740]   Um, really appreciate you talking to me, brother.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.980]   Thank you. Pleasure, buddy. Thank you for the kind words.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.780]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dana White. To support this podcast,
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:48.740]   please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:56.340]   Muhammad Ali. Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.940]   a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:09.620]   a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Thank you for listening
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:14.180]   and hope to see you next time.
