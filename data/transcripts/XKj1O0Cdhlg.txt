[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Is the lack of space repetition adoption a market failure?
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.400]   I think it's probably mostly efficient in places where space repetition, as it
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.460]   stands without substantial, like novel cultural knowledge, that's difficult to
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.540]   transmit and isolate where all of that is valuable.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.260]   We see a lot of space repetition usage.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.100]   So among medical students are highly motivated, have lots of reason to study.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.780]   And the material is shaped in a way that's highly amenable
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.900]   to space repetition usage.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.420]   There's tons of space repetition usage.
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.960]   Duolingo has space repetition integrated into it.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640]   Space repetition is kind of naturally present in the process of immersion learning.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.340]   In fact, modern space repetition tools between the Leitner box and Wozniak super
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.380]   memo, they were both originally motivated by language learning.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.960]   So in language learning, there's like a substantial market for space repetition.
