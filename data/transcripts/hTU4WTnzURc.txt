[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.380]   - Hello everyone,
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.780]   and welcome to this special episode of the podcast.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.480]   I just returned home from Brazil
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.840]   and there we launched my new technology book in Portuguese
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.580]   at the conference hosted by our friends at Fiel,
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.800]   which was a wonderful honor.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   In fact, I discovered that thousands of Brazilians
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.260]   listen regularly to this podcast.
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.300]   And there's even a Portuguese version of APJ.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.020]   So hello to all of you listening right now.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.600]   It was a delight to meet many of you in Achebeia
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.880]   and to receive your gratitude for this podcast for APJ,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.440]   which you wanted me to pass along to Pastor John.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.280]   So I get to do that now.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.480]   - Thank you very much.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.320]   I appreciate it.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.120]   - Yeah, so on behalf of at least the hundreds
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.260]   of Brazilian Christians that I met,
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.220]   thank you Pastor John for your decade long investment
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.640]   in this podcast.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.680]   - And enjoy.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.160]   - Well, while I was in Brazil,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.760]   big news broke here in the States.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.360]   Roe v. Wade has been overturned by the Supreme Court.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.500]   On Friday, the SCOTUS ruling was made official.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.880]   We knew it was coming.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.140]   Back on May 2nd, a draft opinion of the decision was leaked.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.460]   I texted you immediately when that news broke, Pastor John,
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.220]   and that's now official.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.380]   Roe was overturned Friday on June 24.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.360]   This is not the end of abortion.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.980]   This simply turns the legal status of abortion
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.760]   back to individual States,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.700]   and the work of defending the unborn is far from over.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.380]   Discerning Christians will continue to ask
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460]   what should Christians be doing?
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.420]   Our work is urgent, and our work is now more local.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.820]   So it might be helpful for our listeners
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.100]   to know something of what you have done, Pastor John,
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.200]   over the past four decades.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.740]   As the work continues,
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.540]   what has been your answer to the question,
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.460]   what should I do?
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.780]   How have you answered that question
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.100]   in your own life and ministry?
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.860]   - Well, I don't see myself as the ideal pro-life person
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.580]   because I am fallible, I am sinful.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.980]   There are things I've left undone in the last 40 years.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.900]   Things could have been done better.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   But as you and I have reflected on this,
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.420]   and as I've thought about my own life,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.260]   looking at imperfect examples in my life
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   has often proved very helpful,
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.060]   very inspiring to me in my Christian walk.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.500]   And so I will go ahead and venture to say some things
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.520]   that I've done imperfect, though they have been,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   and hope that they will be a help to others.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.400]   So here are the sorts of things
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.580]   that I've done in the last 40 years or so.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.120]   And I think they are the sorts of things
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.740]   that will probably need to be done now
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.460]   for years to come, long after I'm gone.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.740]   So beginning in 1987,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.100]   I preached at least one explicitly pro-life message
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.300]   every year with, I think, two exceptions along the way
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.800]   in my pastoral trek until my stepping away
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.500]   from the pastoral leadership in 2013.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.980]   The last one I preached was January, 2021,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.820]   because the church invited me back for that Sunday.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.340]   It was called "Doing the Right Thing Never Ruins Your Life."
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.460]   I looked at it the other day and I'm really persuaded
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.420]   that message is super important.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.820]   So it's there at Desiring God.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.820]   That's about 25 morning messages on Sanctity of Life Sunday
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.260]   over my pastoral life.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.980]   I recall the very first pro-life sermon I preached
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.900]   was from James 4, verse 2,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   "You desire and do not have, therefore you kill."
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.260]   And I still think that text
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.460]   is one of the most penetrating biblical texts
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.580]   about the origin of abortion in the Bible.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.660]   Second, I tried to spread those messages
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.300]   by putting a few of them in a little book
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.860]   called "Exposing the Dark Work of Abortion,"
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.460]   which I think is free at Desiring God.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.120]   And then when Desiring God came into existence
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.260]   in the mid '90s, we put all these sermons online
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.180]   where they are today.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.140]   Third, I wrote articles for Desiring God
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.420]   and for other outlets.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.460]   And the one that I think is still about the most helpful
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.100]   is "15 Pro-Life Truths to Speak,"
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.060]   which I think is available there at Desiring God.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.580]   Fourth, since we started, you and me, Tony,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.420]   how long has it been, 10 years since we started?
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.260]   - Almost a decade, yeah.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.700]   - Okay, so for those 10 years,
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.800]   there are at least, as I counted them,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   10 podcasts of "Ask Pastor John" related to abortion.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.640]   - Yeah.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.960]   - Fifth, I love to write poetry
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.000]   about the things that move me.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.600]   And I mean move me positively and move me negatively.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   And I've written two relating to the pro-life cause.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.160]   One is called "It," about a young woman
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.880]   who goes in for an abortion,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.920]   and they keep referring to her baby as "it."
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.680]   And then after the procedure, she lifts up her head
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.000]   and sees this little tiny torso on the tray
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.560]   and notices it's unmistakably female
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.840]   and is overwhelmed with her.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.120]   This is not an "it."
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.740]   This was not an "it."
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.240]   Experiences like that, hearing things like that
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.560]   have moved me over the years
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.680]   to write poetry about the cause of life.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.600]   Sixth, I've tried to pray and lead our people in praying
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.400]   against the sin of child killing
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.740]   and for the spiritual miracles
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.640]   that will have to happen in people's lives
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.600]   so that it is overcome in what they want,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.060]   not just what they do.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.120]   Seventh, I mobilized our people to be part of major rallies
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.760]   and I participated in them myself,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   like the MCCL, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life Rally
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.600]   at the Capitol here in Minnesota every year.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.760]   Usually it's below zero.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.680]   It's just absolutely unforgettable
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   to march with five or 10,000 other people
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.920]   and the wind is howling
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.960]   and everybody's bundled up like Eskimos
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   and you're walking in the cause of prayerful support
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.160]   for the opposition to child killing in this country.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.440]   Eighth, there was a season of about three years
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.000]   where I was part of direct action and civil disobedience
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.680]   sitting in front of abortion clinics
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.540]   to block the way into the place of death,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.600]   arrested several times, spent one night in jail.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Ninth, I encouraged and shared in sidewalk counseling
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   where you simply stand peacefully outside abortion clinics
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.700]   and offer literature and conversation to anyone
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.600]   entering in the hopes that perhaps one last obstacle
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   to overcome would help and might change their minds.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.220]   Tenth, I took an abortionist doctor.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.460]   This is one of the most memorable things in my life.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.380]   I just felt so inauthentic
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.980]   not dealing directly with abortionists
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.640]   that I found a way to contact an abortionist doctor
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.040]   about four blocks from my house
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.920]   and I took him out to lunch.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.780]   I told him, "I'm a local pastor.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.060]   "I'm pro-life.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.240]   "I wanna understand you.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.320]   "Would you go out to lunch?"
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.960]   And he was willing.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.640]   And so I went with my 10 points
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.660]   to make the case that he was killing children.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.800]   And he disarmed me immediately by saying,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760]   "I know I'm killing children.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.020]   "It's the lesser of two evils."
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.660]   And the other evil, he said, was,
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.660]   "It's unjust that men can have sex and bear no consequences
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.080]   "but women can have sex
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.720]   "and have to bear all the consequences.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.280]   "That's unjust.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.800]   "Killing the child is the solution to that injustice."
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.220]   His wife, he said,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.160]   I mean, he really was unbelievably honest with me.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.660]   He said, "I wouldn't be doing it
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.620]   "except my wife pressures me to do it.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.980]   "She believes it's the path of justice."
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.720]   Eleventh, I give financially, regularly,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.700]   to several pro-life organizations.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.200]   Twelfth, while I was a pastor,
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.280]   I tried to cultivate a life-affirming culture,
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.560]   which included things like
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.480]   a strong positive view of adoption
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.720]   as a beautiful and normal thing,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.820]   a strong ministry to the disabled,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:51.280]   to combat any notion that would have been better
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.600]   if they'd been aborted.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.360]   I tried to encourage the most pro-life engaged people
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.760]   so that they didn't feel like they were marginal
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.240]   in this church but crucial.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.680]   And generally, I tried to create the atmosphere
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   that this church community is unashamedly pro-life
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.120]   and anti-abortion without any fear
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   that this would have offensive effects on some people.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.360]   I'm sure those people just migrated to other churches
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.960]   where this issue was completely neglected
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.600]   and that was sad.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.880]   I would rather have them change their mind,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.760]   but we weren't gonna mute this crucial reality.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.640]   And finally, and this may be the most important thing, Tony,
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.760]   we did not turn the church
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.180]   into a political or social think tank or action group
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.000]   for the sake of any earthly cause,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.720]   including the cause of pro-life.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.680]   For the sake of preserving the power and effectiveness
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   of our prophetic witness,
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.160]   we did not make the pro-life cause the main thing.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.540]   The main thing is the glory of God.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.800]   And under the glory of God, the salvation of sinners
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.440]   from the wrath of God
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.200]   through the glorious substitutionary work of Jesus Christ,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.940]   dying for sinners on the cross,
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.320]   the glory of God shining through the salvation of sinners
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.800]   by the blood of Jesus is the main thing.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.840]   Far greater than the danger of abortion
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.060]   is the danger of hell.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.680]   Rescuing people for eternal life
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.840]   is more crucial and more loving
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.600]   than rescuing babies from abortion.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   In other words, we care about all suffering,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.280]   especially eternal suffering.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.520]   And I think it is precisely this maintenance
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.360]   of spiritual proportion
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.960]   that is, which keeps in clear view
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.760]   that our citizenship is in heaven
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.880]   and we're rescuing lost people as we wait for our Savior.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.960]   That spiritual proportion,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.400]   that maintenance of spiritual priority and proportion
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   is what gave us Christian credibility over decades
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.920]   in the cause of life,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.720]   rather than simply sinking down to the level
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.960]   of being a world-oriented band of do-gooders.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.520]   We are Christians before we are pro-life.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.400]   We are Christ-exalting before we are life-exalting.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   We want to save souls, the souls of mothers and fathers,
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.260]   as much as we want to save the bodies of the babies.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.120]   The aim for us is not just the end of abortion,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.660]   but the eternal joy of forgiven sinners.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.940]   - Amen.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.660]   Yeah, you've been in this fight against abortion
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.200]   for a very long time.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.900]   So now the court has effectively struck down Roe v. Wade,
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.460]   making it possible for states to legally protect the unborn
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.380]   and many states are doing that very thing right now.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.140]   So what's your own reaction to the SCOTUS decision
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.420]   and this most recent news?
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.100]   - I am thankful.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.980]   And the reason I am thankful
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.980]   is mainly because this was the right thing to do.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.140]   A federal law that prevents the legal protection
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:53.300]   of children from being killed is an evil law.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:59.500]   An evil law has been in place for 50 years.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.140]   It is a good thing that the evil law is gone
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.620]   and I am thankful to God,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.620]   to God in his glorious providence that it is gone.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.260]   And if someone says to me, which I thought they might,
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.900]   so I said it, if someone says to me,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.660]   "Aren't you thankful, John,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.580]   because lives are going to be saved?"
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.860]   You seem to stress it's the right thing.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.980]   Aren't you thankful that lives are going to be saved?
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.400]   My answer is, "I hope they are
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.260]   and I will be thankful if they are."
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.420]   But there are too many variables at play here
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.060]   for me to know what is really going to happen in America
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.440]   as far as the loss of life goes.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.620]   For all I know, we may be entering an era
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.620]   of such visceral rage and coldness of love
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.940]   and multiplication of wickedness,
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.620]   both on the right and on the left,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.780]   that a civil war right here in America
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.180]   could take hundreds of thousands of lives.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.340]   It happened just 160 years ago
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.540]   and the issue of killing millions of children
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.880]   is as explosive as the horrors of slavery.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.360]   Or another upshot could be over the next 10 or 20 years
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.340]   that the morning after pill or some new pill
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.660]   for weeks after or months after
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.500]   becomes so cheap, so effective, so free from side effects
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.260]   that abortions may double, triple, quadruple
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.660]   in their frequency over what they are now
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.580]   with no need for Planned Parenthood at all.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.420]   I don't know whether that's going to happen or not.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.540]   It could.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.140]   Or another possible scenario is that this kind of freedom
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.420]   from consequences of pregnancy
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:12.340]   unleashes a new tidal wave of premarital sex
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.820]   and some new lethal strain of venereal disease arises
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.860]   with hundreds of thousands of young people dying every year.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.100]   That's an easy possibility.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.540]   In other words, I don't know.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.740]   I don't know if the overturning of Roe v. Wade
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.140]   will save lives.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.740]   I hope so.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.820]   I pray so.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.980]   It was absolutely the right thing to do,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.760]   whether more lives are saved or not.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.620]   But the wickedness afoot in America is very deep.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.880]   And where it will take us as a culture, I do not know.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.380]   Lives are destroyed by sin.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.660]   Abortion, whether with suction or a pill,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:11.040]   is only one kind of sin that destroys life.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.260]   There are so many more.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.500]   Over 100,000 people, for example, just recently now,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.540]   are dying every year from drug overdoses.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.120]   And most of those people
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.980]   are not people on the street anymore.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.740]   They're middle-class opioid users
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.180]   who can't find meaning in life.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.420]   And there will, I don't doubt,
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.100]   arise other new ways of destroying ourselves
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.620]   as wickedness multiplies.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.780]   - Yeah, the dark side of our potent technologies
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.340]   amplifying our self-destructiveness.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.260]   And this leads to my final question
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.500]   as we wrap up this special episode.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.200]   I heard you say recently in a meeting
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.620]   that the real post-Roe v. Wade challenge
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.060]   will not be how to make abortions hard to get,
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.060]   but how to make them hard to approve of in the human heart.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.040]   Explain that.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.420]   What did you mean by that line?
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.420]   - I meant that the main battle for human righteousness
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.500]   is not fought at the level of human behavior,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.560]   but at the level of human desire.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.240]   Jesus said in Matthew 15, 19,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.880]   "Out of the heart come evil thoughts,
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.960]   "murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.400]   "theft, false witness, slander."
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.160]   Now, at least four of those sins
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.680]   relate directly to abortion.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.000]   Murder, that's what abortion is.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.880]   Adultery and sexual immorality,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.560]   at least 85% of abortions are owing to sexual immorality
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.200]   because 83% of abortions are done on single women,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.040]   not counting the cases of rape and incest.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   Those women and their boyfriends sinned by having sex,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.880]   which God has protected by putting it
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.880]   in the happy bounds of covenant-keeping marriage.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   False witness, that too comes from the heart,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.000]   and the entire abortion industry is built on false witness,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   namely that the unborn are not human persons.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.100]   We can build legal dams to keep the river of sin
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.740]   that pours out of the human heart from flooding the world
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.240]   with actual behaviors like abortion,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.760]   and that's a good thing.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.460]   That's a good thing to build those dams with laws.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.100]   That's what all good laws do.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.520]   They make it harder for the sinful heart
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.560]   to overflow in outward crimes.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.760]   That just happened with the overturn of Roe v. Wade.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.240]   It was a good thing.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   But we should remember that if the river of sin
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.900]   that flows from the human heart is simply dammed up,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.400]   and nothing changes the heart,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.480]   that river is going to build behind the dam
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.840]   until the reservoir is so deep and so heavy
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.160]   that no legal dam, no mere law can hold it back,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.240]   and a tidal wave of wickedness will overflow the land.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.900]   So what I meant was, and I'm thinking of Christians now,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.700]   especially pastors, is that's our job,
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.340]   preaching to change those hearts.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.660]   That's our job, to portray the glories of Jesus Christ
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.340]   so clearly with such spiritual power
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.220]   that people will see and their hearts will be changed.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.620]   2 Corinthians 3:18 describes that miracle.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.380]   It says, "Beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.380]   we are being changed from one degree of glory to the next."
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:26.140]   Our main job is not new laws, good as that may be,
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.320]   but new hearts.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.200]   That's our main job.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.840]   If that doesn't happen, new laws will collapse
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.420]   under the pressure of unchanged hearts.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.980]   It's only a matter of time.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.120]   But even that way of saying it bothers me.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   It skews the reality in an unbiblical direction.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.880]   It gives the impression that we want to change hearts
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.740]   mainly to preserve good laws.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.280]   That's not the main reason.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.840]   The main reason to quote Jesus in John 3:3 is this,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.280]   "Unless one is born again,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.520]   he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.300]   Without a Christ-exalting heart change, people perish.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.280]   We perish.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:28.320]   It is a loving thing to work for good laws.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.440]   It is more loving to help people enter the kingdom of God.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.840]   The overturning of Roe v. Wade will have its greatest effect
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.700]   if its limitations give life to the Christian truth,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.560]   you must be born again.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.280]   - Yeah, new hearts that love Christ and as a result,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.400]   love others, especially the most vulnerable.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   That's our ultimate aim here.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.280]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this perspective.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.800]   Well, I doubt this will be the last time
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.440]   we address the evil of abortion on the podcast.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.860]   It's certainly not the first time.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.720]   As you mentioned earlier,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.440]   we have 10 or so episodes in the archive.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.840]   You can find them all at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.520]   Type the keyword abortion to see that title list.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.920]   As I look through that list,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   APJ 9 stands out way back in episode nine.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.800]   We looked at your own involvement
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.880]   with the anti-abortion demonstrations
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.480]   in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.680]   including times when you were arrested and once imprisoned.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.600]   You can find that episode at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.800]   That's APJ number nine.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.380]   Well, we have a slate of new episodes recorded
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.780]   and ready to go for you all summer long.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.940]   The next two months are full of fascinating questions
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.920]   that you have emailed us.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.140]   Be watching for those new episodes.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.180]   But this is a wrap for us.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.360]   We're about to split for the summer,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.940]   taking a break from our recordings.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.140]   And Pastor John, you're repositioning
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.780]   for a few months on the East Coast to focus on a project.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.280]   - Yeah, eager to do it.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.380]   Sorry to be away from you,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.820]   but I'm glad we've been able to stay on top of this
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.140]   so people don't have to take a break from APJ.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.660]   And I'll be working on "Look at the Book" mainly
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.140]   for seven weeks as I kind of bury myself out of the way
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.540]   and try to make progress on that project.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.700]   - Excellent.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.580]   And then in two months,
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.180]   we will be together on stage,
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.160]   live at the Getty Sing Conference in Nashville.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.220]   - I was working on my message yesterday, in fact.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   - Well, I can't wait for that too.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.380]   That's coming up on September 6th, 1.30 p.m. local time.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.600]   We'll be the APJ recording.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.760]   We'll be on the main stage, Pastor John and myself,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.280]   and we will record five episodes live, Lord willing.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.620]   We did this exact same thing back in 2019.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.620]   And so I hope to see many of you in Nashville
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.780]   on September 6th.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.140]   For now, thanks for listening to this special episode
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.740]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.460]   and we will see you again very soon.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:24:02.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
