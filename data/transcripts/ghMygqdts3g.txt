[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.680]   - First of all, thank you all
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.240]   for making it to this conference.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.480]   We think it's the 20th conference.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.200]   So it's very exciting that our conference currently
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.720]   is the largest conference, I think, by a good measure
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.160]   relative to conferences in the past.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.720]   And we're just excited to see all of you
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.400]   and we're excited about all of the people
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.920]   who are volunteering and making other contributions.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160]   We're especially excited about our speakers
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960]   who are all donating their time to be here.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.680]   So one thing we test ran last year
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.640]   that worked out really well was this idea
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   of doing a university where we're doing a full day
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920]   or a half day of educational sessions.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   And that went over really well.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440]   Pretty much everyone who attended the conference
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   made it to university.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.700]   So we decided to do it again,
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600]   but we decided to break it into two tracks.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   So in this room, we have kind of a somewhat more basic track
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.560]   and then in the next room, we have a more advanced track.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   So this is 101, we have 501 going on next door.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.940]   There's absolutely nothing wrong with mixing and matching.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.520]   If you wanna be here for part of this one
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860]   and move over to the other room for the next one,
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.080]   that's absolutely fine.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.120]   But one thing to know is that the times
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.480]   don't line up perfectly.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.560]   So when we have our breaks for this session,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.260]   it won't necessarily be a break for the other session.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.800]   So you'll need to mind the schedule
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.480]   if you want to dip in and see sessions in the adjacent room.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.260]   We have a very tight schedule for this session.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.560]   If you attended last year,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.040]   you remember we really kept things moving along very quickly.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.120]   We'll do the same for this event today.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.560]   We'll be watching the clock very, very quickly.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.760]   I wanted to make a note about questions.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   We're handling questions a little bit differently
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   than we've done in the past.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.600]   So some of you may have remembered we had
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.360]   kind of an open mic set up for questions.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.400]   This year we are doing written questions.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.280]   So use a sheet of paper, whatever you've got handy
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.160]   to submit a question.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.440]   We have Gauri here who is going to look
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   through your questions and help us decide
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   when we get to the question part of the discussion,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.080]   will help us decide the most worthy questions.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.680]   And I'm sure that we'll have more than we need,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.000]   but please go ahead and submit a question.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.440]   Wanted to start with my portion of the presentation,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.080]   which relates to kind of what I call
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   primordial asset allocation,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.800]   things to do before you actually get started investing.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.720]   Because even though at Bogleheads
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.480]   we're all very passionate about the idea
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   of getting started in investing,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.200]   getting your money to work for you
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.760]   as soon as humanly possible,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.520]   it's actually better to lay the groundwork.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.920]   So that's what I'm gonna be talking about today.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.000]   So this is just a slide.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.920]   We've all seen a million like this
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.560]   that illustrates the importance of getting an early start.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   And there are other versions of this
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.960]   that show that even if someone got started later
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.480]   and contributed a larger sum
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.040]   than that person who got started very early,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.560]   it's very hard to make good strides on catch up
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.800]   if you haven't started early,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.600]   which is one of the reasons why we all evangelize
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.720]   about the importance of first job,
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.520]   get started in investing.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.640]   So getting started is super important,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.120]   but there are other things that you need to attend to
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.160]   before you start investing.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.120]   So what are the things that you need to address
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.840]   before you begin investing?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.920]   The first thing is identify your why.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.960]   Why are you investing?
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.840]   What are your goals?
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.400]   Articulating, quantifying, probably prioritizing goals,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.100]   that's top of the heap.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.520]   Then thinking about human capital.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.280]   Especially for people who are young
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.960]   and just starting out in their lives,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.760]   their human capital is their most valuable asset by far.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   We'll talk about how to burnish human capital.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.960]   Creating a safety net should also precede
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.580]   investing for the long term,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.520]   so you'd wanna be sure to have
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.960]   property and casualty insurance and so forth,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.760]   as well as a basic emergency fund.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.500]   We'll talk about how debt fits into this.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.280]   Many new graduates especially
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   come out of school with significant loads of debt
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.480]   and have to figure out how to balance
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.440]   having debt and paying down that debt
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.160]   alongside longer term investing goals.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880]   And finally creating a budget and a savings target.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.160]   So this is just a slide of what I think of
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   as kind of a pyramid when you're thinking about
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.200]   your financial plan.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.020]   And you can see that at the tippy top
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.400]   is the thing that many of us obsess over,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.920]   investment selection.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.080]   But really when you think about the most important
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.640]   determinants of whether someone succeeds or fails,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.360]   I would say that having a goal,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480]   having a well articulated goal,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.920]   and also having a vision for what you're investing for
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.600]   is one of the key reasons why you would want to
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.360]   put that at the bottom of the pyramid.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.040]   Human capital, I discussed just in passing,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.380]   but the human capital is the value of your earnings power
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.400]   over your lifetime.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   It's the economic value of your earnings power.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.500]   It's, as I mentioned, young people's most powerful asset.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.520]   So it's important to be really thoughtful
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.240]   about growing that human capital
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.340]   because there's a direct connection
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.680]   between your eventual investments.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.240]   The more you have to, the more income you have,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.400]   the more you will have to save and invest.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   So thinking about human capital is super important.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.220]   For younger people especially,
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.680]   thinking about making additional investments in education
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.220]   can be very, very valuable
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.020]   and pay for itself many times over.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.020]   But even those of us who are older
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.340]   and further along in our careers,
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.180]   I would argue that there are still plenty of opportunities
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.740]   to continue to invest in your own human capital.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.780]   So how do we do that?
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.060]   Well, we would think about investing in our own health.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.480]   We'd think about investing in additional training.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.940]   We'd think about making sure that our connections
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.060]   within our employment circle are robust.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.840]   And so really thinking about that whole range of activities
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.200]   that you can do to embellish your own human capital
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.180]   is really important.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.580]   But as I mentioned, higher earnings,
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.560]   there's a very tight connection
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.180]   with higher savings opportunities.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.180]   So this is a slide that depicts income groupings
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.560]   and shows that folks with higher incomes quite logically
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.400]   have many more opportunities to put money to work.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.840]   And many of us have likely found this in our own lives
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.440]   where as we earn more,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   we have more funds at our disposable for saving.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.080]   So kind of a logical, intuitive connection there.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.260]   Creating a safety net is another thing
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.100]   that I would urge everyone to think about
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.180]   before beginning investing in long-term securities.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.220]   So there are really two ways that I think about this.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.960]   The first would be to make sure that you have purchased
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.920]   all the appropriate insurance products,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.100]   probably don't wanna overdo insurance,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.480]   but make sure that you are covered
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.860]   in terms of property and casualty, disability.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.380]   We've all heard statistics
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.620]   about how you're much more likely to be disabled
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.860]   than certainly to die.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.900]   And so it makes sense to have disability insurance
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.820]   and then life insurance, obviously,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.780]   if you have dependents,
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.420]   people who are depending on your economic wherewithal.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.860]   So laying a safety net
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.500]   in terms of having those insurance products,
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.180]   and then the old sort of the self-funded insurance
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.720]   where you have your own emergency fund,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.740]   where you have liquid reserves set aside.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.660]   When I think about young people
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.660]   who are just getting their lives started,
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.420]   I would say this is really job one, two, and three,
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.700]   is making sure that they have liquid reserves set aside
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.820]   to cover them for those outlays
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.300]   that are really difficult to predict.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.540]   So the baseline in terms of emergency funding,
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.100]   the one I learned when I went through the CFP program
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.940]   was that you would wanna have three to six months'
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.300]   worth of living expenses at a minimum.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.780]   But I like the idea of really customizing that
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.500]   based on your own situation.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.300]   So if you're a higher earner, if you're an older worker,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.020]   if you're someone who has,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.260]   if you're the sole earner in your household,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.700]   so you have other people depending on your income,
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.560]   I would argue you would think about
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.100]   having an even larger emergency fund,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.940]   more like a year's worth of living expenses.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.540]   And I think young people sometimes get daunted
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.940]   by that three to six months reserve.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.820]   And the way I always think about it is
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.180]   it's not how much you're spending currently,
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.860]   it's how much you could get by on in a pinch, right?
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.660]   That you don't wanna think about
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.980]   this overwhelming sum of what your current spending is.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.340]   Think about the things that you might change
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.220]   if, for example, you experience job loss.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.460]   But I like the idea of each of us stepping back
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.200]   and thinking about, well, how much do we wanna hold
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.140]   in terms of liquid reserves?
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.340]   Little bit more on emergency funds.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.480]   I like the idea of keeping it super liquid.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.140]   I think it makes sense to keep it liquid.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.100]   The idea is that it is there in a pinch.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.620]   So you wouldn't want to invest in anything
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.180]   where there is a risk of you not being made whole
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.620]   if you, in fact, need those funds.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.260]   So I would say bond funds,
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.680]   even very safe short-term bond funds,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.660]   I would take off the table in terms of emergency funding.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.260]   Stocks, absolutely off the table
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.140]   in terms of emergency funding.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.140]   And then if you're using CDs,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.820]   and the good news is is that interest rates
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.260]   on all manner of savings instruments
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.840]   are looking better today.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.300]   But if you are using CDs,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.680]   you'd wanna make sure that you're not going to pay a penalty
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.020]   if you need to tap into those funds earlier
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.200]   than you expected to.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.460]   So just read the fine print if you're using CDs.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.400]   Another key point here is that your emergency fund
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.080]   can be kind of scattered in a few places.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.640]   So maybe it's whatever you keep in your checking account
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.000]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.640]   Maybe it's some liquid reserves that you hold
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.600]   in your taxable investment account side by side
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.560]   with your investment,
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.380]   so it doesn't have to be all in one place.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.200]   In terms of the where,
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.420]   a key thing to note while we're talking about strictures,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.100]   you just wanna be careful to hold those emergency reserves
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.040]   in something that you could easily tap
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.640]   without taxes or penalty.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   So retirement accounts would generally not be a first stop
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.880]   or would not be a stop at all.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.540]   In terms of emergency funding,
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.720]   you'd probably wanna use some sort of taxable
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.540]   non-retirement account for those assets.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.440]   But I would say there are a couple of investment accounts
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.840]   that could be sort of standby liquid reserve accounts.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.300]   So one I like to call out is Roth IRAs.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.160]   Ideally, you would have the money invested for long-term
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.840]   and you would never touch it until you reached retirement.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.120]   But the Roth IRAs do offer a really nice escape hatch
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.380]   in terms of being able to withdraw those contributions
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.360]   without any penalty or taxes at any time.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.220]   So especially for sometimes young savers,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.960]   when I talk to young workers,
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.240]   I often say that the Roth IRA can be a really great
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   sort of compliment to the emergency fund.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.100]   So if in a worst case scenario,
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.020]   you need to tap those funds, they are there for you.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.820]   Another account that can fit in here
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.980]   would be a health savings account.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.620]   It shouldn't be anyone's first stop emergency fund,
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.740]   but health savings accounts have a really nice feature
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.860]   in that if you're using the health savings account
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.640]   to save and to invest for long-term
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.080]   and you're using non-HSA assets
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.520]   to actually cover your health savings
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.400]   or your health expenses as you incur them,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   the good news is that you can tap the HSA at a later date
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   as long as you have receipts available
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.920]   to substantiate those expenses
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.760]   that you paid with non-HSA assets.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.240]   So it's a super nice feature.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.680]   I know Mike Piper is going to talk about
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.900]   all manner of tax-advantaged vehicles,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.660]   but from a pure tax standpoint,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.300]   HSAs are easy to love
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.100]   because they have a lot of nice features.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.700]   So the debt versus invest question,
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.700]   that's a fork in the road that many people hit
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   really at all life stages.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.860]   And a key point I would make there
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.780]   is that you want to use your return on investment,
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.540]   and I would put that in quotes, to light the way.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.220]   So I'll just use a simple example from my own life.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.360]   Probably seven years ago, my husband and I
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.140]   still had a little bit left on our 15-year mortgage.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.580]   And I remember my husband had shopped around
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.320]   and locked in a 2.875% mortgage rate,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.240]   which at the time was really quite a low mortgage.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.720]   And he loved having that very low,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.540]   no one had a mortgage rate that low.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.780]   But we looked at our savings
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.680]   and we looked at our liquid reserves
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.540]   and what we were earning on the money,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.620]   and this is before yields went up as they have recently,
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.780]   and we said, well, this is kind of an easy decision
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.460]   to pay off this mortgage.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.860]   We weren't getting any mortgage interest deduction
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.220]   at that point either.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.740]   It was an easy decision to pay off our mortgage
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.580]   rather than earning next to nothing in our savings,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.060]   especially 'cause we really didn't need
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.380]   those savings imminently.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.060]   So I like the idea of using that concept.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.140]   Think about the expected return on your debt pay down,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.520]   which is basically your interest rate
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.340]   plus any, or less any tax benefits
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.200]   that you're earning to hold that debt,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.280]   alongside whatever you expect to earn on your funds,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.820]   on your invested funds.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.260]   And I think that that can be a great
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.740]   sort of centering mechanism when figuring out
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.900]   how to address debt pay down.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.340]   Right now, I would say that given how high interest rates
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.380]   are on very safe investments,
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.700]   and how low many mortgage holders rates are
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.220]   relative to those safe returns,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.180]   it's probably much less attractive
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.540]   to consider mortgage pay down.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.380]   But it's a very personal decision.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.380]   Use your expected return on each of those uses of funds
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.980]   to help illuminate.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.340]   Finally, creating a budget and setting a savings target
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.580]   would be the next step before you actually determine
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.100]   whether you want to go ahead and invest.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.060]   You'd wanna think about having that budget
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.340]   that you use on an ongoing basis.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.700]   And there are really two main ways to think about budgeting.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.740]   There's certainly lots of software out there
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.460]   to assist people with budgeting.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.420]   But two ways I think about it would be,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.380]   think about using the old-fashioned expense tracking,
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.780]   or you can use some sort of digital expense tracking system
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.900]   to track your outlays on an ongoing basis,
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.860]   and periodically check up on your spending
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.420]   to make sure that it's in line
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.300]   with whatever you said you would spend
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.900]   within those categories.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.200]   The way that we do it in our household,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.740]   and have done for many, many years,
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.180]   is that we let our savings target light the way.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.700]   So we just automate those contributions
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.100]   to our retirement plans, to our IRAs,
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.420]   to our taxable brokerage account,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.100]   and we have those funds coming out of our checking account
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.660]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.620]   And then the amount that's left over for us
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.340]   is an amount that we are free to spend,
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.000]   or we can certainly save more if we're able to do so.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.660]   But that's been a really powerful tool for us,
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.180]   where we're not monkeying around
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.100]   with tracking spending in each category.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.640]   So I would say it's very individual-specific for us,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.980]   for my husband and me, that was kind of an intuitive way
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.580]   to approach it, it was something that worked for us.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.900]   But I would urge you each to experiment
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.580]   with different strategies.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.140]   If you're working with young people,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.780]   talking to young people in your life,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.300]   I would counsel them to choose one of those two strategies.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.140]   Thank you.
