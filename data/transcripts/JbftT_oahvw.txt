[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Well, today marks the birthday of Augustine.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.140]   The church father was born on this date, November 13, back in the year 354.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.080]   He was, of course, the Bishop of Hippo in North Africa.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.700]   And his story of conversion and spiritual awakening is laid out in a book under the
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.320]   title The Confessions, a classic memoir enjoyed today in over a dozen available English translations.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   That book and all of his books have left a permanent impact on the Reformation tradition
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.700]   and specifically on John Piper and this movement we call Christian Hedonism.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.320]   When Augustine was in his 70s, he went toe-to-toe with a nemesis named Pelagius, a freewill
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.600]   theologian in Britain.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.200]   Here's the backstory and why it matters today from John Piper's 1998 biographic message
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.960]   on Augustine.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.180]   My assumption is that too much Reformed thinking and preaching and worship in our day has not
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:14.480]   penetrated to the root of how grace actually triumphs through joy in believers' lives.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:23.440]   And therefore, our Reformed thinking and writing and preaching and worshiping is only half
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   Augustinian and half biblical and half beautiful.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   It isn't beautiful to people.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.080]   Now let me try to unpack that.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.380]   Pelagius was a British monk who lived in Rome.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.680]   He was there when it was sacked.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.720]   He had to leave.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   He taught, "Though grace may facilitate the achieving of righteousness, it is not necessary
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.540]   to that end."
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.040]   Grace is not necessary to making right choices.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.140]   He did not believe in the doctrine of original sin and he believed that human nature was
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.960]   at its core irreducibly good and we are able to do everything we are commanded to do.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.040]   And therefore, Pelagius and Augustine were on a collision course because when he read
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.560]   the Confessions, this sentence infuriated him.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:33.140]   "Give me the grace, O Lord, to do as you command and command me to do what you will.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.980]   O holy God, when your commands are obeyed, it is from you that we receive the power to
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.660]   obey them."
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.980]   Well Pelagius went ballistic at this sentence because it was an assault on human goodness.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.460]   It was an assault on the freedom of the will.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.660]   In his judgment it was therefore an assault on responsibility and the whole moral fabric
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.440]   of the world would unravel if Augustine had his way in this assessment of his own conversion
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.660]   and experience with God.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.740]   Well now Augustine had not come to this conviction quickly, namely that anything good he does
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.940]   is a gift from God.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.260]   He had not arrived there quickly.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.820]   I walked into a bookstore at Hope College and saw the book by Augustine on the freedom
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.820]   of the will.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.740]   I said, "Oh good, I've got a lecture on this in a year."
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.860]   So I picked it up and started reading it.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.380]   I said, "Yowie, what is this?
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.880]   I don't want a lecture on this."
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.140]   He wrote that book four years after his conversion and radically changed his mind from what that
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.140]   book says.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.500]   So be careful claiming what Augustine thinks about this or that.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:08.140]   When he wrote his confessions he had settled the matter differently and deeply and unchangeably
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.780]   in his own mind.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.100]   This paragraph that I'm about to read here in my judgment for me and my theology and
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.620]   my ministry and my life is the most important paragraph I've ever read in Augustine.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.900]   Here it is.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.060]   During all those years, where was my free will?
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.280]   What was the hidden secret place from which it was summoned in a moment so that I might
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.300]   bend my neck to your easy yoke?
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.780]   How sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys which I had once
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.380]   feared to lose.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.500]   You drove them from me.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.300]   You who are the true, the sovereign joy.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.260]   You drove them from me and you took their place.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.220]   You who are sweeter than all pleasure, though not to the flesh and blood.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.540]   You who outshine all light, yet are hidden deeper than any secret in our hearts.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.340]   You who surpass all honor, though not in the eyes of men who see all honor in themselves.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:44.100]   Oh Lord, my God, my light, my wealth, my salvation.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.180]   There's a theology in that quote.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.180]   It's called Christian hedonism.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.660]   I call it Christian hedonism.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.420]   Nobody else calls it Christian hedonism.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.940]   And you don't have to call it Christian hedonism, but I hope you believe it.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.460]   You drove them from me.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.220]   You are the true, the sovereign joy.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:18.500]   Now there's the missing piece in contemporary Reformed preaching.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.900]   Augustine's understanding of grace is this.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:36.220]   Grace is God's giving us sovereign joy in God that triumphs over the joy of sin.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.460]   That's grace in the thought of Augustine.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.220]   I'll say it again.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:55.180]   Grace is God's giving us a sovereign joy in God that triumphs over the joy in sin.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:03.300]   In other words, God works deep in the human heart to transform the springs of joy so that
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.340]   we love God more than we love sex or anything else.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.300]   Now Mark, here's another problem with contemporary American Christianity.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:26.840]   Loving God in Augustine's mind is never reduced to deeds of obedience or acts of willpower.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.940]   How common that is in our day.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.660]   Love is commanded so it can't be an emotion.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.260]   Love is an act of will.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.860]   Love is obedience to God.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.380]   Oh for Augustine in our day.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.620]   Here's his definition of the love of God.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:58.740]   I call charity the motion of the soul toward the enjoyment of God for his own sake and
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.980]   the enjoyment of oneself and one's neighbor for the sake of God.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.060]   Joy is the essence of love.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.060]   And for American Christianity it's a caboose.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:23.020]   No wonder our reformed thinking and preaching is unappealing.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.060]   We don't get grace.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:34.100]   Grace is the giving of a sovereign joy that triumphs over all competitors.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:41.260]   Loving God for Augustine is always conceived essentially as delighting in God above all
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.220]   things and in other things for the sake of God.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:53.500]   He loves thee too little, O God, who loves anything together with thee which he loves
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.860]   not for thy sake.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.180]   That is a revolutionary sentence.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.140]   I read that years ago and it just blew me away.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.780]   I like my wife.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.420]   She's here somewhere.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.180]   I like Talisa.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.740]   I could idolize my family.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.740]   My four boys are a treasure to me.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:31.380]   And better that they die than that I love them more than God or love them for any reason
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.300]   but for God's sake.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.780]   That's Augustinianism at its core.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.420]   Now Augustine analyzed his own motives down to the root.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.180]   He saw this as a universal.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.380]   Every man, he said, that's a quote, this is not John Piper.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.820]   This is Augustine.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:59.080]   Every man whatsoever his condition desires to be happy.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.940]   There is no man who does not desire this and each one desires it with such earnestness
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.740]   and that he prefers it to all other things.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:19.060]   Whoever in fact desires other things desires them for this end.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:26.260]   And this desire, this delight, this longing for happiness governs the will.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.380]   Now here's the catch.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:38.140]   The delight that the will always follows we do not determine.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.620]   And Pelagius smelled it and hated it.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.660]   Here's the quote from Augustine.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:52.940]   Who has it in his power to have such a motive present to his mind that his will shall be
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.060]   influenced to believe?
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:01.940]   Who can welcome in his mind something which does not give him delight?
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:08.820]   But who has it in his power to ensure that something will delight him will turn up?
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.260]   Or that he will delight in what does turn up?
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.660]   If those things delight us which serve our advancement towards God, that is due not to
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:28.980]   our own whim or industry or meritorious works, but to the inspiration of God and to the grace
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.800]   which He bestows.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:45.200]   In other words, converting, saving grace is God's giving delight in God, holiness, Christ,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.800]   scripture, the beauty of holiness and glory.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:12:00.200]   Suddenly you see and love and cherish and revel and long for them.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.520]   Where'd that come from?
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.280]   Now the will will move with it.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:13.680]   But before that's given, the will's going back to the internet and the magazine and
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   the concubine and the television and the family.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   Now picture this.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   He's 72.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:28.360]   You're supposed to retire at 65.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:37.080]   You don't take on Pelagius at 70, which he did.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.200]   And Paulinus, his friend, said, "Augustine, why?
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.880]   You're an old man.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.600]   Lay it down."
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.960]   That's my paraphrase.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.080]   But here's a non-paraphrase answer quoted from Augustine.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   Why?
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:01.840]   "First and foremost, because no subject gives me greater pleasure.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.880]   For what ought to be more attractive to us sick men than grace, grace by which we are
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.680]   healed?
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.840]   For us lazy men than grace, grace by which we are stirred up?
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:26.760]   For us men longing to act than grace by which we are helped?"
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:33.280]   Now what makes that answer so compelling and so powerful is that the healing, stirring,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   helping, enabling grace, I call it future grace, is the giving of a compelling, triumphant
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.280]   joy.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.780]   Grace governs life.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:55.480]   And the life of a 70-year-old man, by giving a supreme joy in the supremacy of God and
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.680]   His glory and His sufficiency and His beauty and His treasure, which triumphs over all
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   other things.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:10.040]   And when you see a Pelagius coming along, undermining that grace and that gift, even
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.680]   at 70, you go to battle.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.240]   An incredible story.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.080]   Happy birthday to Augustine.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.440]   This is taken from John Piper's 1998 biographic message titled, "The Swan is Not Silent,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.480]   Sovereign Joy in the Life and Thought of St. Augustine."
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.400]   You can find the entire message at DesiringGod.org.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.120]   It's one of my favorites.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.080]   And it's a message that has a paragraph in it that inspired me to write a whole book
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.640]   of my own, The Joy Project.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.000]   I know some of you have read it.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.360]   It all comes out of this message, really, was the germ, the seed that grew into that
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   book.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.920]   Well, to all of you Augustinians out there, thank you for listening along and for subscribing
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.440]   to the Ask Pastor John podcast in your favorite app or in YouTube.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.260]   We really appreciate you listening along.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.600]   Next time, we look at whether or not we will pray in heaven.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   Will we pray in heaven?
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   It's a shrewd question.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.200]   Coming up next, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.360]   We'll see you on Friday.
