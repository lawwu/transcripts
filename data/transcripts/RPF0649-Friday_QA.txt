[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.040]   Well, generally that's what a live Q&A show means.

[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.360]   that have been written in,

[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700]   We begin today with a quick comment
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.440]   on the presidential debates
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.580]   that I watched this last week,
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.880]   the Democratic candidate debates.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   Don't worry, I'm not going to get too deep into the politics.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.420]   I'm simply going to mention a couple of things,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660]   specifically as it relates to money,
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.260]   especially to the future of the finances
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.900]   of these United States.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540]   As long-time listeners know,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.040]   I have been concerned for some time
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   over the burgeoning government debt
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.600]   that we see in the United States,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.780]   running basically a little under a trillion dollar deficit,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.740]   and this is completely unprecedented.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.920]   It's not that a trillion dollar deficit
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.740]   is in and of itself unprecedented,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.580]   but it's unprecedented to be running
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.420]   a trillion dollar deficit
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.480]   in a time of relative prosperity,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.200]   where markets are generally doing well,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.820]   employment is generally doing well, et cetera.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.300]   For context, you should go back,
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.140]   if you haven't heard it,
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.060]   and listen to episodes 628 and 629
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.540]   of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.500]   called "Federal Debt, the Ticking Time Bomb
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.800]   "that No One is Willing to Diffuse,"
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.340]   where I go over in detail the basic situation
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.680]   that we face in terms of governmental finances
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.280]   in the United States.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.880]   Now, in this series of shows,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.120]   and even in my commentary today,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.460]   I don't have any specific predictions,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.100]   other than to point out that basically it's impossible
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.200]   that we will ever, one, pay off the federal,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.300]   we can close deficits,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.100]   but it's impossible that federal debt
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.000]   will ever go down or be paid off,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.940]   and that the most optimistic scenarios
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.940]   that can be laid out basically require massive changes
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.580]   with regard to the way that the United States runs
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.580]   and structures its finances.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.920]   And it's possible, I don't think this is likely,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.720]   but it's possible that if we were to see
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.360]   some kind of major changes in the next few years,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.020]   it's possible that the long-term crises
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.660]   could be potentially avoided,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.940]   or at least some say that that is the case.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.100]   Now, in order to have some kind of change,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.000]   you would need to, there needs to be a couple of things.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.780]   Either, number one, there needs to be massive decreases
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.000]   in governmental spending
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.280]   and/or massive increases in taxation.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   If that doesn't happen,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.280]   and if we don't see people taking significant steps
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.320]   towards that end within the next few years,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.980]   then you can be absolutely sure
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.360]   that the only potential outcome is bankruptcy.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.860]   Now, I'm 97% confident
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.000]   that that is the only potential outcome
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   that I can see working,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.200]   is basically bankruptcy of different kinds.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   And the question is not whether or not
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.980]   the US government will default on its various promises,
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.080]   but simply what that default will look like.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.440]   And none of us know exactly
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.160]   what that default will look like.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.180]   We can't know.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.880]   It'll probably look like many different things.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.840]   The best example I always like to point to
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.000]   is what has happened to the Social Security Administration
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.900]   when it has gone bankrupt multiple times
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.460]   over the past few decades.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.560]   Well, things change.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   Benefits are chopped, things change,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   and there are a couple of different options.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.200]   But back to that point of what if I'm wrong?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.160]   I've always looked for that.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.980]   Well, what if I'm wrong?
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.640]   What would be the evidence that I would expect to see
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.440]   if I am wrong?
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.760]   And in episodes 628 and 629 of the show,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.400]   I talked about how the next few years
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.640]   are gonna make a big difference,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.440]   or are gonna be very predictive.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.600]   And I said we need to watch the various people involved
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.440]   in governmental financing and see what they say
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.500]   and see what they do.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.160]   Now, what is quite challenging is at the moment,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.920]   it's very hard to find anybody
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.540]   who is lobbying for fiscal restraint.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.240]   Basically, you have a political party in the United States
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.080]   that wants to spend massive amounts of money,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.460]   and you have another political party
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.080]   that wants to spend massive amounts of money times seven.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.240]   And that's basically the difference.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.320]   So I don't expect at this point
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   really any fiscal restraint from the Republican Party.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.740]   I don't expect any fiscal restraint from President Trump.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.400]   That's never been something that he's interested in.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.880]   It's not something that,
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.300]   it's basically something that the Republican Party
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.680]   has largely abandoned.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.760]   There are at least a few Republican politicians
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.040]   that kind of quietly say,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.780]   "Well, we might have problems in the future,"
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.000]   but they don't really talk about it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.900]   No one's out there holding the torch.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.260]   Basically, at this point,
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.640]   I can't point to any prominent politician
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.880]   who is loudly discussing the need for fiscal restraint.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.520]   So on the Republican side,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.200]   there doesn't seem to be any reason
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.560]   to expect things to change.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.000]   What about the Democratic side?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   Well, I thought this was interesting,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.620]   and I watched a little bit,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.900]   and I read the transcripts of the Democratic debates
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.960]   of the 20 different presidential candidates
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.780]   who made the debate stage
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.180]   for the initial round of debates this week.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.560]   And for context, I'm recording and releasing this show
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.060]   on Friday, June 28, 2019.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.120]   So if you're listening at a later date,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.580]   it'd be interesting to see what has actually happened.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.800]   Now, these debates are a difficult format,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.160]   20 people, a total of four hours of discussion.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.120]   It's pretty much an impossible format.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.600]   But I thought it was interesting to see
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.760]   what is actually discussed.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.880]   Well, first, it's very clear that if in the future,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.640]   a Democrat were to be elected as president,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.400]   it's very clear that that candidate,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   whoever they wind up being,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.080]   is very likely to want to increase welfare programs
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.480]   of various kinds.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.080]   If you watched the debates or read about them
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.120]   or pay any attention to the political movement,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.520]   there are a bunch of big, loud advocacy programs,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.720]   things like government healthcare programs.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.320]   Basically, I don't know
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.000]   of a Democratic presidential candidate
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.700]   who at this point in time is not pretty loudly advocating
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.240]   for a government-run healthcare program.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.800]   The majority of them have indicated
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.060]   that they would like to eliminate
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.080]   the private insurance marketplace in the United States.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.680]   That's an interesting position to take,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.020]   and we'll see what happens in the long term.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.240]   But that's a massive increase in government spending.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.680]   We'll see what happens with that.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.440]   One of the other big issues that's very loudly talked about
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.380]   is programs like cancellation of student debt.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.180]   That's also an interesting issue to think about,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.960]   but costs a lot of money.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   And there are a number of other minor programs.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.440]   You have people talking about reparations,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.720]   reparations to blacks.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.480]   Or you have Andrew Yang talking about universal basic income
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.000]   and a couple other candidates hinting
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.760]   at various permutations of universal basic income.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.600]   But you have, I think it's fair to say,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   a fairly broad consensus among the Democratic candidates
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.640]   that there's going to be,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.920]   we need more government programs.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.520]   We need more new, big, expensive government programs.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.320]   The most worrying, of course, is healthcare.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.960]   Obamacare didn't work, was too expensive.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.760]   And so now because Obamacare, I guess, didn't work,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.640]   then now we need to replace it with government healthcare.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.040]   So that's the starting point.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.780]   Now, what about the flip side?
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.600]   Is anybody talking about fiscal restraint?
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.760]   Well, I searched the transcripts
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.480]   to make sure that I had this right.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.760]   And in four hours, two nights of discussion,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   I found two discussions and/or allusions
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.020]   to the federal debt and/or the deficit, one on each night.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.520]   The first one came on night one,
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   and it was in an exchange with candidate Amy Klobuchar.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.400]   And when talking about immigration,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.360]   she was being questioned about immigration and her answer.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.280]   I'll just read her answer.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.640]   Guthrie was asking the question.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.000]   Guthrie says this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.960]   He wants to no longer have it be a crime
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.560]   to illegally cross the border.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   Do you support that?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.080]   Do you think it should be a civil offense only?
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.160]   And if so, do you worry about potentially
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.360]   incentivizing people to come here?
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.680]   Klobuchar responds,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.260]   immigrants, they do not diminish America.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.800]   They are in America, and I'm happy to look at his proposal,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.000]   but I do think you wanna make sure
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.560]   that you have provisions in place
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   that allow you to go after traffickers
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.960]   and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.680]   What I really think we need to do,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.160]   what I really think we need to step back and talk about
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   is the economic imperative here,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.040]   and that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.880]   are headed up by people that came from other countries.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.760]   25% of our US Nobel laureates were born in other countries.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.000]   We have a situation right now
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.800]   where we need workers in our fields and in our factories.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.200]   We need them to start small businesses.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.180]   We need their ideas,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.240]   and this president has literally gone backwards
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.000]   at a time where our economy needs immigrants.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.280]   And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.520]   that passed the Senate with Republican support
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.240]   to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.080]   and get it done.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.800]   It brings the debt down by $158 billion.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.520]   That was the extent of the discussion on night one
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.800]   was that one single allusion in Amy Klobuchar
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.400]   to a bill from evidently 2013
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.960]   that allegedly brings the debt down by $158 billion.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   I have no idea what that proposal was from 2013.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.480]   I'm not interested to go and research it at this point,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.320]   but just without commenting on the proposal
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.840]   or what's even in it, the number is a joke.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   And that's the thing you need to remember.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.800]   In an era where we're running
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.720]   almost a trillion dollars of deficit,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   $158 billion isn't even relevant in terms of the deficit,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.880]   let alone the debt.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.620]   And so assuming that she was accurate with her statements,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.800]   I don't know if she was talking about
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.920]   bringing the deficit down by $158 billion
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.720]   or lowering the national debt by $158 billion.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's just a joke.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.440]   There's no relevance here
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   to the long-term problem whatsoever.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.160]   That was the only reference or allusion I could find
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.600]   to the discussion in night one of the debates.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   Well, what about night two?
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.560]   The first time I could find where,
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.000]   or the first and only thing I could find in night two
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.240]   where national debt was discussed
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.080]   or governmental debt was discussed
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.600]   was when candidate Kamala Harris was asked a direct question
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.760]   as to whether Democrats have a responsibility
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.320]   to talk about how they will pay
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   for ambitious new spending programs.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.200]   And I'll read it to you.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.040]   Debate moderator Guthrie asks a question.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   Says, "Senator Harrison, sorry, Senator Harris,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.260]   "there's a lot of talk in this primary
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.060]   "about new government benefits,
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.860]   "such as student loan cancellation,
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.200]   "free college, healthcare, and more.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.640]   "Do you think that Democrats have a responsibility
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   "to explain how they will pay
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.520]   "for every proposal they make along those lines?"
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.960]   Harris responds, "Well, let me tell you something.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.080]   "I hear that question, but where was that question
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.320]   "when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.280]   "that benefits the top 1%
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.960]   "and the biggest corporations in this country
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   "contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   "which middle-class families will pay for
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.560]   "one way or another.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.820]   "Working families need support and need to be lifted up.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.380]   "And frankly, this economy is not working or working people."
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.220]   I assume she meant for working people.
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.820]   "For too long, the rules have been written
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.900]   "in the favor of the people who have the most
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.740]   "and not in favor of the people who work the most,
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.940]   "which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.700]   "so for every family that is making
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.000]   "less than $100,000 per year,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.360]   "they will receive a tax credit
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.140]   "that they can collect up to $500 a month,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.400]   "which will make all the difference
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.240]   "between those families being able to get
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.580]   "through the end of the month with dignity
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.340]   "and was support or not.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.840]   "And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.480]   "that benefits the top 1%
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.140]   "and the biggest corporations in America."
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.460]   And that was the extent of the discussion
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.280]   for night two of the debate.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.020]   Now, first, of course, a president cannot repeal a tax bill
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.460]   by executive order.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.140]   Such a move would require the involvement of Congress
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.580]   to change the tax code,
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.540]   but that's relatively insignificant.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.380]   It's important to know that,
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.860]   but it's relatively insignificant for my purposes.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.980]   The first part of her answer was certainly true,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.500]   but it was just basic whataboutism.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.360]   The idea is, well, since no one is pressing President Trump
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.980]   or the Republicans on their spending,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.440]   especially with this giant new tax bill
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.140]   that wasn't offset with spending cuts,
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.320]   why should the Democrats have to talk about the subject?
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.260]   Well, certainly the criticism is accurate.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.120]   Any fair-minded person would have to acknowledge
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.260]   that the Republicans are not doing a great job
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.180]   driving the governmental fiscal situation.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.700]   But that's just whataboutism in politics.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.060]   The second part of the answer is interesting
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.100]   because not only, basically,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.860]   she winds up spending more money in what she's proposing.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.980]   Basically, as I understand it,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.020]   she's proposing something like a $500 a month UBI of sorts
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.600]   for any family earning less than $100,000.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.020]   And although it's not UBI, it's a tax credit,
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.260]   but then she's trying to offset it
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.660]   with increased taxes on the 1% and corporations,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.300]   is the quote of what she said.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.860]   Now, this kind of proposal is not remotely serious
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.100]   with the actual facts.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.560]   That's what's so troublesome.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   It's just simply not at all dealing squarely
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.820]   with how desperate the situation is
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.460]   with regard to the overall fiscal situation
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.020]   in the United States.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.200]   Let me read to you just a quick excerpt
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.360]   from the article that I discussed
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.380]   where in episode 628 and 629
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.740]   that put the size of the problem into context.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.120]   Now, remember, the entire article that I discussed,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.440]   which was Brian Riedel's comprehensive federal budget plan
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.880]   to avert a debt crisis,
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.760]   his proposal, which was carefully calculated out,
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.920]   didn't actually solve any problem
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.340]   as far as didn't result in a decrease of debt,
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.800]   didn't result in a decrease of deficit,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.600]   basically just potentially forestalled an absolute crisis
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.960]   by freezing the deficit at 95% of GDP.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.240]   And when he was talking about liberal fantasies,
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.800]   he talked about conservative fantasies
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.640]   and liberal fantasies,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   talked about what a fantasy the idea is
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.320]   that you can just simply just tax the rich.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.680]   And I'll read you a couple of paragraphs.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.820]   Just tax the rich.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.180]   Liberal advocates often vastly overstate the degree
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.640]   to which upper income tax increases
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   can finance the ever-expanding government.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.080]   In the first place,
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.560]   the United States already has the most progressive tax code
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.160]   in the OECD,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.240]   even adjusting for differences in income inequality.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   And setting aside the moral questions
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.640]   that would be raised by the government
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.240]   seizing the vast majority of any family's income,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   basic math shows that large tax increases
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.120]   on high income Americans
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.180]   cannot close most of the long-term budget deficit.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.160]   Start with an extreme proposition,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.160]   a 100% tax rate on all income over $500,000.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.200]   Result, this would raise barely more than 5% of GDP,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.840]   at least for year one.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.060]   After that, one needs a heroic, if not absurd, projection
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.000]   that this tax would have no effect on working or investment.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.240]   Next, try a slightly more realistic doubling
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   of the top 35% and 37% tax brackets to 70% and 74%.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   Result, this would raise only approximately 1.6% of GDP.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.480]   And even that figure ignores all revenues lost
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.120]   to the economic effects of 85% marginal tax rates
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.040]   when including state and payroll taxes on work or investment
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.680]   as well as tax avoidance and evasion.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.040]   And he goes on and talks about this,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.720]   one more about corporate taxes.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   Nor can corporate tax hikes close much of the gap.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.680]   America's total corporate tax revenues
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.300]   are generally in line with other developed nations.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.640]   Although modest reforms may be on the table,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.760]   major changes, such as a 10-point rate increase,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   would raise less than 0.5% of GDP,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.680]   while giving more companies an incentive to relocate abroad.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.520]   And he goes on.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   The point is that there's no,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.880]   these numbers, these proposals,
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.640]   they're nowhere near relevant to what could actually happen
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.660]   in terms of the amount of money that could be collected.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.060]   It sounds good as a line in a debate,
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.320]   but it doesn't give anything more than that.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.240]   It panders to this idea, this fantasy,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.480]   but it's not actually relevant math in any way whatsoever.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.640]   Those are the only two things I could find
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.280]   in the debate on the Democratic side.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.120]   Now, I wanna be fully, I wanna concede the point
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.980]   that one debate like this is not necessarily
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.520]   in and of itself indicative of everything
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.000]   that can happen in a larger context.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.120]   The political season is still young.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.340]   There are a lot of things that will happen
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.220]   in the political season in the months to come.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.600]   But watch and see if there's any discussion or nod
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.360]   towards the actual fiscal situation in the United States.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.980]   That's extremely important.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.300]   So we'll see what happens as time goes on,
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.340]   but watch and see.
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.900]   At the moment, I don't expect anything good to come.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.340]   I don't see any reason why President Trump
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.300]   or the Republican Party will all of a sudden
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   become the party of fiscal conservatism,
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.180]   and I don't see any indications
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.460]   that the Democratic Party is going to become
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.900]   fiscally conservative in any way either.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.260]   And if that's the case, assuming that's the case,
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.420]   a couple years from now,
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.660]   when after the presidential election,
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.340]   we'll be into another administration,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.340]   I don't see any change in the expenditures
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.160]   of the US government in coming years.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.540]   So we are in uncharted waters,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.940]   and it will be interesting to see what winds up happening.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.980]   Let's watch it together, but let's keep an eye on it.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.760]   As far as I'm concerned, there's a good reason
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.420]   at this point in time to be paying very careful attention
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   and planning for the worst,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.740]   which is ultimately in the coming decades,
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.540]   the long-term bankruptcy of the US federal government.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.580]   We begin in Maryland.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.020]   How can I serve you today?
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.140]   - Hi, Josh, a long time fan of yours.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.540]   I've been listening to your podcast
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.780]   for quite a little while.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:58.220]   And so I'm calling today because I just have some question
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.540]   about on a financial planning side,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.460]   I just wanted to ask.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.460]   And I mean, I'm currently around 31, 33 in range
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.940]   and make a reasonable income, not six figure income.
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   And I have a little bit over like 200, 300,
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.580]   thousand dollars in assets.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.580]   And I'm kind of just trying to figure it out
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.020]   how to design my life so that I can live the life
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.460]   that I want to live at the same time
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.020]   while trying to achieve financial independence
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.260]   without stressing too much about the numbers.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.100]   - Okay.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.900]   So tell me more.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.980]   - In which area would you like to learn a little bit more?
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.900]   - What would it, let's just start with a question.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.380]   Let's assume that you had today,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.220]   say five to $10,000 a month of income coming in
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.740]   from your investment portfolio.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.220]   You didn't have to work.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.860]   What would you do with your life?
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:12.780]   - I think I would try to organize,
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.260]   try to organize more events around personal finance,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.900]   try to do a little bit more financial coaching,
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.500]   do a help, I mean, as I understand it from previous podcasts
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   that you have already been putting out there,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.580]   like that industry, it's not necessarily money generating
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.180]   because a lot of people don't really care
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.580]   about finances too much.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.060]   But so for me, if money is no issue,
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.860]   I would still probably want to do that,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.220]   try to bring awareness to,
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.780]   that they should care about their finances
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.500]   and they should, and I'm teaching in finances.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.700]   - Are you currently working
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.540]   in the financial industry in any way?
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:02.540]   - I'm currently, I'm a financial analyst,
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.060]   but I crunch number, you know,
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.460]   I review number, analyze number for companies.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.180]   I have a background in finance and accounting,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.540]   but I do not work in the financial service industry
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.500]   because for the reason why you leave the industry,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.940]   because the people that tend to use the service
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.300]   or the financial planners generally tend to go after
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.060]   the people that probably don't necessarily need
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.420]   the help too much anyway, if that makes sense.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.260]   I mean, that mostly higher net worth.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:40.420]   My goal, serve the, probably the middle class families
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:46.660]   that might not be served, but be served now.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.500]   If that makes sense.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.860]   - Right, so let me clarify my opinion on the subject
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.900]   just to make sure that I'm accurately understood
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.140]   because I don't fully agree with the way
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.620]   that you characterized my opinion.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.780]   So I'll clarify it and then we can talk
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.740]   about some solutions for you.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.740]   Number one, I do not believe that it's not possible
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.060]   to serve the lower class or the middle class
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.460]   when it comes to financial advice.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.700]   That is not an accurate understanding of what I believe.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.380]   I do believe it's possible to serve the lower class
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.620]   and the middle class with good financial advice.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.940]   I don't believe it's possible to do that
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.440]   with any kind of personal coaching model
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.500]   where you're working one-on-one,
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.540]   where you are sitting at a coffee shop,
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.340]   helping somebody with their finances
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.020]   and they make $30,000 a year,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.500]   but they're willing to take out their checkbook
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   and write you a couple hundred dollar check.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.820]   It can't be done in that way.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.580]   So what are the models where I think it can be done?
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.620]   Number one, I think it can be done in education
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.620]   if you're going from one to many.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.340]   There are many good financial coaches and educators
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.620]   who have made a living and made a fortune
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.700]   helping the lower and middle class,
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.660]   but the only sustainable way that can be accomplished
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.340]   is in the context of a one to many relationship.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   You can sell a stadium full of tickets.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.860]   You could sell a stadium worth of tickets
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.020]   to the lower and middle class at $20 a pop
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.580]   and have a $200,000 day for you
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.500]   if you can find a way to market
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.980]   to the lower and middle class.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.240]   The best example here, Dave Ramsey does this.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.340]   Many other financial educators do this.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.700]   You can do this in many niches.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.460]   You can do it in a religious niche.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.380]   You can do it in an investing niche.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.780]   You can do it in many ways.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.020]   Many real estate investors have made a fortune
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.500]   selling 20, 30, $40 tickets to a real estate seminar
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.780]   to somebody who is in the lower and middle class.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.300]   So you can do it that way.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.940]   Another way that it can be done
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.140]   is where your payment that you're receiving
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.140]   for your services is related to the sale of a product.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.660]   So the best example here
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.660]   would be selling something like life insurance.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.500]   I used to sell life insurance policies.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.780]   I sold a lot of term life insurance
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.180]   to lower and middle class families who really needed it.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.620]   And as long as I can make my income from a commission,
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.940]   I could give as an accompaniment
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.220]   to the sale of that life insurance product,
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.340]   I could give some useful and helpful financial advice
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.740]   to somebody who ordinarily wouldn't pay for it.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.180]   If I sold a simple term life insurance policy,
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.540]   let's say I sold a policy at $40 a month,
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.100]   million dollars a term life insurance
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.580]   to a young kind of just getting started family,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.860]   lower or middle class family, $40 a month,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.940]   that means the annual premiums are $480.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.980]   And so let's call it $500 for easier math.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.820]   Depending on the life insurance company,
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.460]   the commission rate that I would earn
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.920]   on the sale of that life insurance policy
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.820]   would be anywhere from 50 to 120%
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.140]   of the first year's commission,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.460]   which means I could make an income
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.460]   of somewhere between 250 and $550 for that sale.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.160]   Now, it's not that hard to sell term life insurance policies
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.660]   to lower and middle class income people.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.380]   And as long as I can make three to $500 on the sale,
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.560]   then I can afford to do that.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.260]   It's a little hard at those rates
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.460]   because you have to go through 10 potential buyers
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.860]   to wind up selling to one.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.620]   And so it's not as simple for anyone
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.300]   who's never been in a business like that,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.540]   it's not as simple as saying,
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.500]   I just make $500 for a one hour meeting.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.900]   No, it's a $500 commission over the course of say,
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.500]   three hours of meetings with somebody
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.660]   by the time you go through all the different stages
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.660]   of the meeting process.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.860]   And that $500 of commission has to also compensate you
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.700]   for the nine other people that you talk to
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.820]   but didn't wind up buying from you.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.780]   So, but the point is you can afford to do it
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.520]   if you can sell life insurance,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.620]   or if you can sell mortgages, or if you can sell something.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.540]   Those are two very good business models
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.300]   where you can make a living working with the lower class
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.880]   and middle class people,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.580]   either on a one to many approach,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.140]   selling books, selling courses, selling seminars,
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.060]   selling education, selling a radio show,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.000]   selling a podcast, you can do it on selling a blog, right?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.580]   There are many bloggers who are making a living
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.100]   helping people who are in the lower or middle class.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.500]   There are many people on YouTube
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.820]   that are helping people do it,
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.580]   but it has to be a one to many model
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.780]   because poor people and middle class people
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.340]   are not used to spending money on good financial advice.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.780]   Now, if you're gonna do a one to one model
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.900]   and you're going to give financial advice or do coaching,
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.620]   the only people that are gonna be willing
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.660]   to pull out a checkbook or willing to pull out cash
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.620]   are gonna be people who are affluent.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.220]   So if somebody's thinking about,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.020]   where am I gonna make my car payment
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.380]   versus where am I,
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.900]   maybe I should think to talk to somebody about my future,
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.340]   the average person is gonna make their car payment
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.300]   'cause that's the upfront problem.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.500]   And so that's where, in my opinion,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.860]   all of the coaching models break down
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.500]   if you're aiming it towards lower or middle income people.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.580]   They're just on the whole not willing to pay the money
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.860]   for hourly consulting fees.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.540]   I do a little bit of hourly consulting from time to time.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.980]   I don't advertise it, it's not a major thing,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.260]   but when people email me, I say, sure, I'll do it.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.140]   I charge 300 bucks an hour for people who wanna do that
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.340]   and I charge by the minute,
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.360]   which makes it a tremendous deal.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.980]   That is the best deal in the world.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.740]   I should double or triple my rates.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.580]   I have never received an inquiry by,
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.260]   I shouldn't have said never.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.900]   I can't remember ever receiving,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.780]   if I've received one, it's one or possibly one or two.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.620]   I can't remember receiving an inquiry from somebody
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.380]   about coaching or advice if that person didn't make
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.260]   at least in excess of six figures.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.500]   And it's much more common that the average person
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.880]   that writes to me is a multimillionaire.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.940]   So that's the problem.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.060]   I don't see any way to solve it.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.000]   So that's my opinion of kind of the financial coaching model
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.420]   is simply that you can't do it one-on-one with poor people.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.660]   If you think that you're gonna go out
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.440]   and do budget coaching with people who are in debt,
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.460]   they're not gonna pay.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.980]   You can write a book and sell it for $10
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.360]   and make a lot of money if you can effectively market it,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.060]   but you're not gonna do it with a coaching model.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.900]   Does that help?
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.460]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.380]   - Okay. - Thank you.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.980]   - So here's my answer to your question
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.620]   of financial independence.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.660]   You have two to $300,000.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.500]   Are you married?
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.320]   Do you have children?
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.660]   - Single. - Single.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.220]   So as a single man with a two to $300,000 net worth,
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.300]   there is no life decision
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.620]   that you cannot pursue at this point in time.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.020]   You're in your early 30s and you have a lot of money.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.460]   You are already in the top few percent.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.100]   I don't know if it's the 3%, the 4%,
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.980]   but you're within the top at least 5%.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.880]   Maybe, I don't know.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.000]   I should check these brackets so I can say this accurately.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.380]   But you're in the top few percent of the American society
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.300]   in terms of wealth.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.700]   And if you have an income
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.940]   that's a little less than six figures,
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.060]   you can expect your wealth to continue massively.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.380]   So at this point in time,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.780]   there's nothing that you couldn't do if you chose to.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.380]   There's no job that you couldn't go and prepare for,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.300]   even if it required massive amounts of retraining,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.420]   or even if it required you to go to school
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.740]   to spend money on education or certification.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.940]   There's nothing you couldn't pursue there.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.920]   In addition, there's hardly any fun thing
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.900]   that you couldn't do.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.840]   You could buy a truck and drive all around the world.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.820]   You could buy a sailboat and sail the Caribbean.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.700]   There's almost nothing you can't do.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.800]   So at this point, you should be thinking
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.280]   like somebody who is financially free,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.560]   and you should be seeking to optimize your future
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.640]   as best you can see right now.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.880]   So if that means that if you had $5,000 to $10,000 a month
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.560]   coming in per month and you would do financial coaching,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.720]   then work on a plan to start moving in that direction.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.520]   You do have to solve the investment side of things,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.160]   but you can solve that in a number of ways.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.200]   But you need to be moving your career in the direction
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.520]   of what you would be doing,
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.980]   and then think about how you would make money from that.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.780]   That's my simplest answer of how to think like somebody
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.320]   who is financially independent
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.800]   while you reach that fuller level
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.100]   of being able to live off of your investment income.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.980]   But you're already financially free, in my opinion.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.080]   - Thank you for the encouragement,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   and thank you for the,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   yeah, I mean, thank you for the assessment
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.080]   of my current situation.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   So my question is, how should I get started?
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.000]   I have gone through Financial Peace University.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.640]   I can try to be a facilitator.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.920]   And in my opinion, outside of a church
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.360]   and potentially a library, that's not very many places,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.160]   like public places where you don't,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.000]   where there's like a low-cost way
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.560]   of potentially hosting class on,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.960]   I know I'm getting into the nuts and bolts here,
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.780]   and of getting started.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.160]   How would, I guess, how would you go about it
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.280]   in terms of an actual plan,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.640]   if I were to pursue that path?
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.840]   - So if I went broke today, and I wanted to start over,
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   and I had no platform, and I had nothing set up,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.160]   and I were facing a problem like that,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.080]   and I was saying, you know what,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.120]   I really would like to teach people about money
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.560]   in a way that I could make a living on it
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.280]   and share some of the things that I have learned.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.700]   If I wanna, and if my goal were to reach the,
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.520]   reach the not-yet-wealthy,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.060]   then I have to, I'm gonna begin with the presupposition
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.360]   that the not-yet-wealthy are not gonna pay money
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.000]   for my class.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.540]   And I just think that's accurate.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.480]   I hate it, I hate that it is that way.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   I just, in all my experience, that has been the case.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.640]   There are plenty of books about money in your local library,
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.680]   there are plenty of books in your local bookstore.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.840]   Poor people very rarely go and pursue those things.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.600]   So I gotta figure out who's gonna pay me.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.980]   So I'm gonna look at it and say,
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.880]   where's my paycheck gonna come from?
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.160]   My answer to that is going to be a corporation,
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.320]   a not-for-profit entity,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.080]   it's like some kind of community organization,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.960]   or possibly, like you said,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.540]   possibly something like a church organization.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.100]   And I would try to find some way
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.660]   where those organizations can host me and pay me
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.140]   so that I can afford to go and give a talk
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.580]   that their people would come to.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.580]   So if you were to look at your town
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.960]   that's around, that's near where you are,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.500]   you'll find that there are dozens and thousands
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.380]   of businesses in your town, wherever you live.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.420]   And those thousands of businesses,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.980]   probably depending on the type of business,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.580]   from time to time do something like a lunch and learn.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.780]   They come with good education.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.020]   And so what I would do is I would try to find
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.660]   some interesting hook that would be really relevant
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.660]   to the people in my community or in a certain industry.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.500]   I would research and think through some kind of strategy,
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.220]   and I would market that to the corporation.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.380]   And I would charge them, say, $500 to come in,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.500]   give a lunch and learn.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.140]   I would position it with the fact that,
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.620]   hey, I'm not selling any financial products,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.100]   I don't have any insurance sales, et cetera,
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.600]   but I do have this curriculum.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.060]   I would develop a curriculum,
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.520]   something that I thought was really gonna help them.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.220]   I would pull together some of the research
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.920]   that shows that employees who are more financially,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.820]   who are more financially stable are better employees,
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.740]   et cetera, and I would market that
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.220]   and figure out how to market that to corporations.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.340]   You could do the same things
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.940]   with some kind of local not-for-profit entities.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.900]   So if you wanted to help high school students
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.260]   from poor families, then you've gotta go
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.220]   and figure out how to get sponsored
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.420]   by the non-profit organizations
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.260]   that are already working in that community,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.760]   and you gotta develop a program
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.940]   of something that's really, really useful there.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.980]   So that's the best I got, that's what I would do,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.820]   and that's how I would do it locally.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.020]   I don't see any other way that it could be done
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.960]   profitably enough to keep you in the business.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.580]   But I would say don't despise online.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.580]   The competition is thick online,
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.780]   but the best way to reach the people
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.300]   is probably gonna be online
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   with some interesting and unique hook.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.420]   And I'm increasingly convinced
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.940]   that almost any person who's open and transparent
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.760]   and yet who has an interesting story
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.420]   can find a niche of people.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.260]   So whatever that niche is that you would like to work in,
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.420]   the tighter the niche, the better,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.740]   and it can still be done online.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.100]   So that's how I would do it.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.980]   - Okay, well, thank you very much for all your help.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.140]   - Keep, go ahead, I'll finish.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.660]   Just keep working at it,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.100]   because I do love the thought of people being teachers.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.380]   I think that is super, super valuable,
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.960]   but I do wanna be realistic about the challenges.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.380]   We go now to Portland, Oregon.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.140]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.540]   - Hi, thanks for doing this.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.640]   I think it's a great platform.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   I really enjoyed your episode on moving out of the country,
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.180]   and I wanted to know if any more content
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.540]   in that regard was coming out.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.940]   - Repeat, I couldn't quite understand.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.860]   You've enjoyed my episode on what topic?
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.540]   - On moving outside of the country.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.900]   - Moving outside of the country.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.260]   Well, certainly, I mean, I don't really,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.180]   there are two reasons, so I'm sure I'll do more on it.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.660]   In fact, I have a show scheduled for the next few days,
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.640]   specifically about the cost of living
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.080]   versus the quality of life with an international flair.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.460]   That's the title that'll be coming in the next few days.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.160]   But I'm not planning to turn the show
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.360]   into the international living
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.600]   or the international radical personal finance platform.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.060]   I'm not sure how long I'll be out of the United States.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.260]   The United States is a wonderful place to live,
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.180]   and I don't know how, and I don't wanna lose
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.220]   all of my appeal to a broad stream US audience
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.940]   by turning the show entirely international.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.340]   But let's start with what your interest is.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.140]   Why are you interested in moving outside
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.420]   of the United States?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.380]   - I just think it's something that hasn't been fully
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.460]   explored in the personal finance space,
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.560]   and I don't know whether we will or we won't,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   but it's something I'm interested
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.880]   in learning a little more about.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.760]   - Sure.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.640]   Well, I'll give you just a quick overview,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.540]   a quick sneak peek, and then give you a chance
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.180]   to ask any questions that you personally have
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.120]   or in terms of your personal interests.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.620]   Moving outside of the United States could be,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.920]   for many people, a real solution to a set of problems.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.820]   And the same thing could be said
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.400]   for moving outside of Canada or of Germany
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.940]   or of Brazil or any other place.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.800]   My reasons for doing it aren't really financial,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.320]   although there can be financial benefits.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.880]   The biggest financial benefit of moving outside
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.240]   of your home country is most likely going to be tax savings.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.760]   So, for example, as I laid out when I talked
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.120]   about the benefit of leaving the United States
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.740]   in terms of some of the tax savings
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.880]   or the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.280]   I mean, for somebody who is earning $100,000 a year
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.620]   from a location-independent business,
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.240]   saving $30,000 of taxes can make a huge difference
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.380]   in their overall financial plans.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.300]   That's a really compelling reason for somebody like that
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.680]   to move outside of the country.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.360]   And more and more, this can be done by people
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.860]   in unique and I would say relatively traditional,
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.840]   relatively traditional industries.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.940]   I gave advice to a guy one time who was a mortgage broker,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.080]   but as a mortgage broker,
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.160]   he did everything virtually already,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.400]   and he moved to Panama.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.360]   He was living in Florida and he moved to Panama,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.840]   and I walked him through all the ways
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.680]   that he could set that up,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.100]   and he could continue to do his business from Panama.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.460]   Everything he needed was right there.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.920]   He was a few hours away from Florida
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.960]   with a $200 round trip flight on Spirit Airlines
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.600]   if he needed to get back to Florida.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.400]   And so for him, it could save him 30,000 bucks a year.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.500]   And even if it's not a forever move,
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.640]   for somebody who's young and earning income,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.920]   that's a big savings.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.660]   And the savings are even more substantial
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.080]   for citizens of any other country,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.360]   Canadians, Brits, Germans, Italians, et cetera,
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.720]   because for those citizens, you can 100% legally move
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.360]   and you can set up your circumstances
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.240]   where you legally owe no income tax whatsoever.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.680]   And even for American citizens,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.520]   I think that the benefits of renunciation of citizenship
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.000]   are really, can be significant for somebody
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.680]   who is earning a lot of money.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.240]   It's entirely legal.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.480]   You can set it up so that you can pay $0
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.200]   of capital gains tax if you're,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.760]   and you can do that from other countries as well.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.360]   So for each person, they have to analyze the benefits.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.780]   So if somebody is a high income earner or a wealthy person,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.400]   there can be major benefits
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.800]   of moving abroad and expatriating.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.480]   I guess probably the best high profile example
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.440]   in the last few years from the American context
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.600]   was Eduardo Saverin,
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.040]   one of the early persons involved with Facebook,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.800]   who he was born in Brazil, but he moved to Singapore.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.960]   And along the way, he renounced his US citizenship.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.120]   He had to pay millions of dollars of tax,
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.920]   but he still saved millions of dollars
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.720]   by renouncing his US citizenship.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   Now, that's the big savings that can be had.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.640]   I'm unconvinced of the value of moving abroad
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.840]   with regard to saving money on expenses.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.400]   I think in most cases, the United States
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.680]   is one of the cheapest places in the world to live.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.360]   It often doesn't feel like that,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.040]   especially with regard to housing costs,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.440]   but I'm here to say it is,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.840]   because overall, if you're not a high income earner,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.520]   you can live pretty tax efficiently,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.800]   pretty cost efficiently in the US American context.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.040]   So I don't know, if I didn't make a lot of money,
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.760]   I don't know of a better place to live
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.200]   than the United States.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.000]   So that's kind of the financial arm.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.280]   I think there are other benefits though,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.200]   with regard to the just basic lifestyle.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.040]   Some people don't fit well in US American culture.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.600]   I think it'd be better off for them to go somewhere
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.440]   where they did fit well, if they could find such a place.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.840]   There are some things that people want
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.320]   in terms of a lifestyle,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.920]   the certain things that they're looking for.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.520]   And if they would open their eyes a little bit,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.120]   they might find something different in another place.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.480]   So those are just some general things.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.840]   I'll keep talking more about it.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.720]   It's certainly, I can't hide the fact that for me,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.640]   having expatriated from the United States
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.720]   has certainly been a,
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.600]   I can't, I mean, I can't,
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.880]   the show is largely related to who I am and what I do.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.800]   So I can't hide from that,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.000]   but it's not without its costs.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.120]   I miss a lot of things about the United States
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.680]   and I'm not sure I'll be gone forever.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.880]   Any specific questions?
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.040]   - No, thank you.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   I just wanted to let you know,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.960]   I was interested in that content
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.120]   and I appreciate your perspective.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.600]   - Well, I will keep it going in the future
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.520]   as more, as I come up with more ideas, I will do that.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.920]   So thank you for calling in.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   All right, we go next to Pennsylvania.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.760]   Welcome to the show.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.800]   - Yeah, hi there, Joshua.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.640]   My name is Guy Smith.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.600]   I've been listening for about four years
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.240]   and I've called in before too
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.480]   on some of these open calls.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.800]   I just happened to pop in on Facebook and there you were.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.160]   So I thought I'd give it a shot.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:04.240]   First of all, I wanna thank you for a couple of callers back.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.520]   I really kind of answered one of the questions
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.360]   I've been looking at.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.120]   I have a personal finance podcast of my own
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.680]   and I've been trying to figure out what to offer
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.480]   and how to monetize and what courses look like for me.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.840]   And that helped kind of guide me along the way
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.680]   a little bit with that.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   So I really appreciate that.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.520]   - Good.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:30.000]   - So my main question, when I saw it pop up,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.560]   what I decided kind of to ask you about today
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.880]   is so when I think about investing,
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.560]   one of the things I've been transitioning a little bit
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.840]   or I guess studying my investing strategy
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.200]   a little bit more the last couple of years
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.480]   than I have before.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.560]   In the past, I just had a financial advisor
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.000]   and started putting money away,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.920]   filling up my Roth IRA in a managed fund.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.320]   And then I started doing some research.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.760]   I started doing a lot of index fund investing.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.040]   So I'm investing in total stock market,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.200]   things of that nature.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.360]   And that's going well, I'm being consistent.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.400]   I know that's a long-term strategy,
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:15.280]   but I recently had a relative who is an attorney,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.280]   very successful, someone that I trust and respect,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.880]   started discussing dividend investing with me.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.680]   And he kind of invests in,
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   he kind of has, he really kind of explained it.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.560]   He's done this a long time, he's very successful at it.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.960]   He just said, "Hey, I have 22 companies
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.940]   "that I invest in regularly.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.040]   "My role is they have to put out a dividend
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.080]   "and the dividend has to be increasing yearly."
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.480]   And he kind of pitched it to me in a way
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.640]   that he said every month when he puts money in,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.320]   whichever company is doing the worst
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.480]   is the company he invests in.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.320]   So I've kind of been looking at that,
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.120]   but I'm studying the differences there.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.920]   And I'd be interested to your take away.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   My main question with this is figuring out investing
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.820]   from a moral standpoint.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.000]   And what I mean by that is as a Christian,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.840]   and actually as a pastor,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.400]   one of the things I tried to kind of figure out
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   is understanding that my money is an asset
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.040]   that God's entrusting to me.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.260]   And so I have this, he's not a Christian,
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.720]   so I have this, I think, I have this higher level
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.320]   of moral standard than he has.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.380]   I, you know what I mean?
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.780]   I kind of take it a little bit more seriously
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:43.500]   in the fact, in the sense of where am I putting my money
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.340]   and what kind of business am I supporting?
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.100]   So to kind of just kind of shorten this up,
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:56.100]   I realize that by investing in an index fund,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.660]   I'm investing in every company, essentially,
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.820]   publicly traded in the US,
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.460]   which that means I'm investing in companies
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.460]   that are actively supporting things
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.120]   that I wouldn't wanna support.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.580]   But I kind of feel like,
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.940]   and you tell me what you think of this,
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.820]   tell me if I'm just completely wrong or off on this,
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.300]   or it's the same thing.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.160]   Might be six of one and half a dozen of the other,
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.820]   but for me to hand pick a company,
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.560]   say, you know, a blue chip company,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.820]   that someday, maybe not today, but maybe in the future,
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.540]   I find that they're actively sending money
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:43.320]   to say an LGBTQ organization.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.740]   Is it fair to me, or how should I navigate,
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.260]   how would you navigate the fact that I'm now owner
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.960]   of a business that's supporting that,
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.980]   versus it's kind of the same thing to say,
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.140]   well, I'm already doing that with an index fund.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.300]   But I kind of feel like in my,
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.620]   say if a business in my hometown
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.740]   was looking for local investors and I invested in them,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.260]   but then found out that they were supporting
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.100]   an organization I didn't believe in,
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.740]   I kind of feel like I should handle that the same way.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.900]   The piece of me that's like, yeah,
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.820]   but everything's kind of going in these certain directions.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.420]   And I think, well, maybe it's just kind of the greed in me
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.180]   or what have you, where I'm kind of like,
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.380]   yeah, but those big successful companies,
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.700]   ah, you know, it all kind of comes out of the wash.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.540]   I guess I'm just kind of wanting to,
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.020]   I always really appreciate your take on
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:41.620]   balancing Bible and business,
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.100]   and so I, and money in with all of that.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.900]   So I kind of wanted to see what your take
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:50.380]   and how you would approach that kind of investing.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.860]   Or am I kind of,
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:56.320]   am I kind of just kind of splitting hairs here,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.540]   versus just if I'm gonna do dividend investing,
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.020]   I just need to be a little bit more vigilant
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.240]   about what company receives my money.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.300]   - So there are two, you've touched on basically
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.740]   two questions that are radically different.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.420]   I'll start with the dividend question,
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.220]   because that will be the shorter answer.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.580]   But I'll just give you a few things to consider.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.420]   If you're trying to compare dividend investing
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.420]   versus, let's just compare it to index fund investing,
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.580]   which is your alternative choice,
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.940]   basically, you,
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.700]   it's a hard comparison to make in some ways.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.340]   I think dividend investing is a powerful way to invest.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.220]   And what I like the most about dividend investing
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.660]   is because, is that,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.980]   the practice of dividend investing gives somebody
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.700]   the appreciation that their companies generate income
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.940]   and profits and they receive that.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.380]   And so for a dividend investor,
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.060]   it's a fairly simple thing for them to say,
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.540]   I wanna live on my dividends,
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.740]   I need $5,000 a month to live,
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.140]   so I'm gonna develop a portfolio
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.940]   that will pay me $5,000 in dividends.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.100]   And that's a very powerful thing.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.180]   It's one of the reasons why I think real estate
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.060]   is so powerful for ordinary people,
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.620]   because you can spend the rents that you get in.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.660]   And so dividend investing is extremely powerful
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.640]   because of its simplicity and its intuitive nature.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.180]   Second thing I would say is,
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.380]   when you put together a basket of anything more than,
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.980]   say, 10 companies,
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.300]   especially big, good companies
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.700]   that are publicly traded in the United States,
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.260]   it's very hard to go wrong.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.540]   So don't think that your attorney buddy
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.300]   is somehow a genius because he has 22 or 26 companies
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.820]   and that they do well for him.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.960]   The majority of companies on the United States
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.380]   face such intense pressure that they have to do well.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.140]   They have to be productive.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.340]   And when you think about all the different things
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.900]   that they have to be productive with,
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.740]   they have a team of thousands of people
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.420]   usually spread all around the world.
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.220]   They have global operations selling diverse products.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.140]   They have teams inside where they're constantly
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.800]   trying to come up with new ways to make money.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.760]   They have professional management, professional boards.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.540]   It's pretty unusual for one of those companies
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.780]   to spectacularly fail.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:18.740]   Now, it does happen,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.860]   but it's unusual for one of those companies
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.820]   to spectacularly fail or to go bankrupt.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.900]   And if a company starts to lag,
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.760]   especially a publicly traded company,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.700]   remember all of the officers and directors of that company,
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.940]   the majority or at least a significant portion
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.880]   of their compensation is based upon
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.140]   their financial performance, their stock price, et cetera.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.860]   And so everybody in that company has an incentive
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.780]   to generate more profits and to fix the problem.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   So the board will start swapping out management,
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.600]   things will happen.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.340]   So if you just picked at random any 10 companies
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.740]   from the S&P 500,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.740]   you could come up with a pretty good solid portfolio
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.040]   that would probably in the fullness of time,
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.540]   a few decades worth, would probably perform fairly well.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.420]   Now, dividends are a mark of a company's health,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.800]   a mark of their financial health.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.660]   The fact that they're actually making money.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.280]   They actually have customers.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.740]   They actually do business.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.820]   So that's a very good mark.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.960]   So that takes it up even more
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.060]   from some of these speculative businesses
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.220]   that have a lot of customers,
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.740]   but they lose money every quarter.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.140]   So you can make a very good case just simply for that,
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.260]   for dividend investing.
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.260]   And I like it.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.700]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.100]   Here's one thing though that is important.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.580]   Dividends are not magic.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.500]   And some companies are oriented towards paying dividends
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.340]   and some companies are oriented towards growth.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.180]   And both of these things can be spent.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   So you can spend growth and you can spend dividends.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.340]   So let's use real estate to have a very intuitive example.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.980]   If you buy a house that's worth $100,000
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.820]   and you rent that house out for $1,000 a month,
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.060]   you can spend the $1,000 a month.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.220]   But if your house increases in market value
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.060]   from 100,000 to $150,000,
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.820]   you can also spend the $50,000.
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.740]   It's not unspendable just because it grew
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.460]   and you had your gain from the appreciation of the house
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.280]   and not just from the rents.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.500]   Now in real estate, it's a little harder to access
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.420]   because you'd have to take it out in debt
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.940]   or sell the whole property.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.700]   But in stocks, it's very easy to access.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.420]   You just simply sell some shares.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.420]   And you can go and you can look at,
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.060]   what would be, I guess the most famous example
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.660]   would be something like Berkshire Hathaway, right?
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.580]   No dividends, but their stock price is whatever,
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   100 and I have no idea what it is these days,
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.140]   but six figures.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.580]   So both are valuable.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.420]   And I would say that in some ways,
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.300]   you could make the argument
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.180]   that it's bad for a company to pay dividends,
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.580]   that I would much rather a company never pay dividends
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.920]   so that the money stayed in the hands of the director
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.500]   so that they could invest it effectively
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.660]   than that they pay dividends.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.500]   I guess probably the textbook example here
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.940]   would be a company like Apple,
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.500]   which historically was allergic to paying dividends
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.180]   because somebody like Steve Jobs
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.180]   and their management team would say,
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.500]   listen, we can grow this thing so much bigger
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.980]   if we don't send out dividends.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:11.140]   And so I'm cool with that story too.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.860]   Just like I'm cool with the story of dividends,
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.900]   I'm cool with the story of a company saying,
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.100]   we're not gonna send dividends out.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.740]   Don't you want us to invest your money?
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.660]   We've got a world full of opportunity.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.400]   We've got tremendous ways where we can invest this money,
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.940]   and we'll just go ahead and invest it for you
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.400]   and grow the company bigger.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.740]   And so then when you bring in tax considerations,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.220]   you can make a good argument as well,
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.400]   because I'd a whole lot rather the companies that I own
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.000]   not send me any dividends, which I have to pay taxes on.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.540]   I'd rather they just grow and keep everything stable,
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.680]   and I'll trigger the taxes
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.940]   when I want to actually sell the shares.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.300]   So those are two very simplistic arguments
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.660]   on both sides of the dividend and investing thing.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.280]   I would say in some ways,
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.540]   it is six, one, half dozen, the other.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.860]   That different people will click with different things.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.760]   The most important thing in my opinion
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.120]   is that an investor finds a strategy that they like,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.680]   that they believe in, so that they'll stick with it,
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.660]   they understand it and are happy with it.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.980]   And so then you can have decades of successful investing,
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.000]   and the investor will be satisfied
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.940]   because the investor's goals are being met.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.060]   It's all academic nonsense to try to say,
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.780]   well, is growth investing better or is dividend investing?
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.140]   It's interesting, but it's academic nonsense,
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.100]   because at the end of the day,
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.600]   what we care about is having spendable money.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.820]   That's why we're investing.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.860]   And so if we're investing to have income,
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.740]   then we recognize that.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.900]   And the goal is not to be the most productive investor
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.720]   on Wall Street, the goal is to have income
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.740]   that we can spend on cruises and on houses
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.140]   and on college for our kids or whatever the circumstance is.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.500]   So those are my comments on dividend investing
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.220]   as compared to other forms of investing.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.180]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.340]   There are good investment newsletters.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.440]   The best thing you should do is go down to your local library
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.220]   and read all the investment newsletters
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.120]   and be amazed at how good each of the strategies is,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   and you'll start to appreciate that many strategies can work.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.300]   - Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.060]   I was listening to one of your older podcasts.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.060]   I think it was 2014.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   You interviewed a guy who has a website
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.980]   all about dividend investing,
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.380]   and he made an interesting comment,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.180]   and I don't think your opinion on it came out of that,
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.060]   where he talked about the difference
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.060]   where dividend investing, he doesn't have to,
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.900]   he compared it to cutting off branches from a tree
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.900]   versus just harvesting the fruit,
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.060]   where with dividend investing,
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.940]   you get the dividend and he still has
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.140]   the same amount of shares,
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.180]   whereas with an index fund or a mutual fund
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:45.060]   or maybe even with your growth investing that you mentioned,
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.940]   where you're actually cutting off a share,
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.340]   you're cutting off a branch.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.980]   How does that play out in the real world
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.340]   once you start pulling money from this in retirement?
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.980]   - That was episode 96 of the podcast
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.940]   released November 5, 2014,
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.860]   called Financial Independence via Dividend Investing.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.460]   It was an interview with Jason from Dividend Mantra.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.660]   To me, it just doesn't matter.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.940]   I recognize that he's got a point there
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.980]   that could make sense for some people,
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.820]   but for me, it doesn't really matter.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:23.700]   For me, the stronger argument is a matter of saying,
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.780]   I want the company to invest it effectively.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.420]   I mean, just imagine this.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.980]   Pretend, let's go with real estate.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.180]   Pretend I am a real estate investor,
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.540]   and I'm very good.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.580]   Pretend I'm making 20% returns per year,
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:40.380]   year in, year out, all secured by a rock-solid portfolio,
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.460]   and you say, "I wanna invest with you, Joshua,"
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.180]   and you bring me your $300,000,
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.500]   and I say, "Do you need any money?"
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.540]   You say, "No, I'm investing this for retirement."
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.740]   And so you give me $300,000.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.620]   Do you want me to send you a check every thousand,
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.420]   you know, a check for $5,000 per month,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.700]   or do you want me to buy another property for you
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.900]   so that you can have a future bigger check?
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.900]   In my opinion, it doesn't, like, I'd rather,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.740]   I want, if you find somebody
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:06.380]   who's investing money well for you,
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.900]   I want them to grow my money.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.340]   I don't need the money back.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.420]   Now, and that's why you usually will see dividends
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.220]   paid by companies that are longer in term,
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.220]   they're more stable,
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.060]   they're in more mature markets, et cetera,
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.180]   and in that case, they say,
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.940]   "Listen, we can do a good business here,
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.420]   "but we're happy to pay profits."
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.980]   So I don't have a problem.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.860]   I could be a very happy dividend investor,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.820]   and I could very happily receive no dividends.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.780]   I'm not convinced that there's a right answer either way.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.100]   - Okay, all right, thank you for that.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.300]   - So let me pivot to your second question,
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.300]   which is, of course, much more difficult,
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.420]   but I would say very pertinent.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.100]   The question you have to ask yourself
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   is how much moral responsibility do I personally bear
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.180]   for the way that my money is invested?
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.260]   Now, you said that you're coming
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.300]   from a Christian perspective,
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.700]   you're a Christian pastor,
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.500]   so here is my understanding of biblical theology
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.580]   as it relates to money.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.900]   Number one, in the Bible,
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.940]   it's clearly taught that the money that we have
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.740]   is not our money, it's God's money,
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.340]   and we are stewards of that money.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.600]   We're not owners, we're stewards.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.300]   Now, as stewards, we're to be supported by that.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.780]   God provides for us,
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.960]   it's fine to spend money for the things that we need,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.700]   but we're not ultimately owners.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.660]   So I think of it as a steward,
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:30.100]   and I say, "I'm a steward of these resources."
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.180]   Now, as a steward, what would please my master
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.120]   in the way that these resources are invested?
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:42.820]   How can I please my master with these resources?
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.860]   So if you look at an investment decision,
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.500]   the goal is to look at it and say,
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.420]   "Would my master be pleased
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:51.280]   "with my making this investment decision?"
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.060]   I think that's the best way to look at it.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.700]   It's the very, very clearly true in your theology,
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.500]   and it's a very useful, useful way to look at it,
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.940]   because it keeps us in an appropriate position
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.700]   of being constrained and recognizing I'm a steward,
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:08.300]   and so this money needs to be invested for God's benefit.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.880]   It needs to be invested into his kingdom.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.400]   It needs to be invested for gain.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.900]   Now, that can be challenging,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.880]   because you look at it and say,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.500]   "Does that mean that I give everything away?"
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.820]   Maybe.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.260]   "Does it mean that I buy a stock?"
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.280]   Maybe.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.800]   "Does it mean that I start a business?"
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   Maybe.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.860]   "Does it mean that I send myself
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.220]   "to out on the mission field?"
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:31.180]   Maybe.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.860]   I don't know of a way that any of us
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.060]   could answer that for other people.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.100]   If we go back to the most important stewardship parables
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.860]   as taught by Jesus, you see in some ways
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.300]   that there was a very wide degree of latitude
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.500]   between the master and his servants.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.420]   When the master gave the money to his servants,
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.900]   he said, "Here's the money,"
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.140]   and then he went on a trip,
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.200]   and he didn't necessarily say,
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.020]   "Here's what you have to do with it."
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.540]   The only person that, in the parable of the talents,
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:00.640]   the only person who was condemned to outer darkness
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.820]   was the person who didn't at least take the money
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:05.140]   and go down and invest it with the money changers
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.380]   to make some interest.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.440]   Everyone else was rewarded for that.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.820]   Now, the challenge is, in the United States,
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.120]   most financial education is built upon
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.800]   a foundation of corporate financial management.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.740]   We are taught that the way that we invest
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:24.760]   is through mutual funds.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.620]   We're taught that the only rational way to invest
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.420]   is with an IRA.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.860]   Well, why are we taught that?
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.140]   It's not a natural truth.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.620]   It's not something that can be deduced
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.180]   by just simply looking around and saying,
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:37.980]   "Well, this is the way that it should be."
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.260]   It's something that's taught
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.140]   by the corporate financial industry.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.340]   Now, I'm thankful for that industry.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.860]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.180]   The public stock market is an incredible thing.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:52.060]   The mutual fund industry is an incredible thing.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.700]   To have such a world of investments available to us
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.180]   is a really powerful and wonderful thing.
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.540]   And so I'm thankful that it exists.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.500]   I don't say that it's a bad thing,
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.620]   but I do think it's important to recognize
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.140]   that it's a very corporatized model.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.700]   And so the incentive that somebody has
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.560]   to come and sell you an investment
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.060]   is based upon their incentive to earn it.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.340]   And even someone like Jack Bogle,
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.820]   he was certainly a humble, down-to-earth guy
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.560]   who really cared about people
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.980]   and cared about excellent investing.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.900]   I think that's great.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.140]   He was a capitalist, just like me.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.500]   We're all in that, but we just gotta recognize
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.340]   that this is a very corporatized model.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.780]   And it's very unusual.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.780]   If we were to go through the span of history
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.260]   and look at our modern day,
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.620]   the modern corporatized financial management system
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.620]   basically is an invention of, what, the last century,
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:47.700]   I think would be a good statement to say,
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.060]   basically the last century.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.680]   And what's more important is it's basically
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.080]   the mass involvement of people in the markets,
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.140]   the way that we have today,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.100]   is basically an invention of the last 30 to 50 years.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.220]   Because prior to the last 30 to 50 years
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.080]   with the 401(k) revolution,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.340]   the average American and the average person in the world
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.280]   never owned stocks.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.220]   Stock market was a rich man's game.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.460]   Stock ownership and investment
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.360]   was something that the wealthy people did.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.760]   So the average person really never considered going
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.400]   and buying a share of stocks.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.720]   So this is a very, very new thing.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.240]   Now, let's look at the question and say,
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.920]   is this a good thing?
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.740]   Has it been a force for good?
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.780]   Maybe, maybe not.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:28.620]   We could analyze it in different ways.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.140]   But I want to think carefully and recognize
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.840]   that taking money and buying a mutual fund from Vanguard,
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.900]   shares of a mutual fund from Vanguard
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.640]   is not the historical thing
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.520]   that should always be done with money.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.460]   So is it the best thing for me to do with money?
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.980]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:52.980]   I see a lot of problems to lay at the feet
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.620]   of the corporatized financial investment schemes.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.020]   I see a whole lot of things
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:03.260]   that really could be acknowledged by that industry.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.540]   And I see a whole lot of harm that comes
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.660]   when people think that that's the only way
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.020]   that they can invest.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.220]   Now, I used to be part of it.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.180]   I used to sell mutual funds, I used to sell insurance,
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.400]   I used to have those licenses, et cetera, and I left it.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.780]   When I left, I didn't leave for moral reasons.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.340]   Although I had some misgivings
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.820]   about a number of different things,
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.900]   but there was nothing where I said,
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.900]   I just can't, I can't be associated with this anymore.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.200]   That was never my own personal story.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.500]   But as I left, I did start to gain increasing clarity.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.360]   Now to the question of should I invest with this company?
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   I would say that any person who is not wrestling with that
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.300]   is probably not thinking soberly about it.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.940]   I don't think this is an area
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.460]   where any of us have the right to say to another person,
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.620]   you cannot do this,
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.940]   or for you to own an index fund is sin.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.520]   I don't see any biblical warrant
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.620]   as to why we could make a statement that strong.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:00.260]   However, it is a matter of conscience,
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.720]   and I think it is a matter where increasingly
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.660]   we should pay attention to it.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.340]   I came to a point sometime after I left
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.740]   the financial industry where I could no longer do it.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.380]   And I came to the point where I said,
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.100]   I was so disgusted with the actions
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.020]   of the large publicly traded companies
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.660]   in the United States, I was so disgusted with it,
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   I came to a point where I said, I can't do it.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.780]   I can't be complicit.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.780]   I can't stand before God and say
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.000]   that I'm investing his money into this trash.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.840]   Now whatever the issue,
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.880]   there are many good things to be concerned about.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.340]   There are traditional concerns
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.720]   about the promotion of sin and immorality,
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.640]   whether it's alcohol companies
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.220]   or tobacco companies, things like that.
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.120]   I'm not personally as bothered by that stuff
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:43.960]   as many people are,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.540]   although I recognize that there's an argument there.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.220]   I have major moral misgivings
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.060]   about the engagement of American industry in war.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.020]   If we go back and we trace the violence
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.640]   and the war that's been perpetrated
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.320]   over the last century by US American companies
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.820]   being primarily the supporters of that,
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.220]   the development of the military industrial complex,
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.620]   the funding of that, it's absolutely,
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.020]   utterly immoral what has done
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.700]   and what has been promoted by the leaders
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.580]   of these companies.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.660]   And they've made their fortunes
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.940]   murdering people all around the world.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.680]   And that gets very underappreciated in many parts.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.180]   And yet it's a major function
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.800]   of American foreign diplomacy, et cetera.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.860]   You can go back and trace it all the way through.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.380]   Other more hot button current moral issues, abortion.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.360]   Look at the, it's very hard for me
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.260]   when you see that the companies trying to,
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.940]   especially the media companies, et cetera,
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.020]   all the current hoopla over abortion,
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.420]   saying, well, we're not gonna film films in Georgia,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.260]   we're not gonna do this,
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.420]   or we're gonna boycott this state and the other state.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.780]   That's your money that you're funding that stuff
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.620]   for the murder of babies,
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.540]   the most helpless, indefensible creatures among us.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.260]   How can I earn off of this company
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.160]   that is spending my money, God's money,
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.020]   on this kind of thing?
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.420]   And then it's become especially difficult,
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.940]   as you say, with the promotion of homosexuality.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.180]   Right now, we're just finishing up Pride Month
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.980]   in the United States of America.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.460]   And I can't think of, I mean, I'm sure they're out there,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.460]   but almost anywhere you turn,
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.740]   every major company is actively promoting
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:29.760]   homosexual practice, which is utterly harmful to people,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.820]   utterly a moral abomination.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:34.140]   And then especially now you bring it on
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.500]   with transgenderism, which destroys people's lives.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.300]   And yet that's the active thing.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.120]   So you look at that,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.980]   and it's increasingly hard for me to understand
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.660]   how any person with any moral thinking
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.180]   could be engaged in that.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.940]   Now, I understand the people who promote it
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.580]   as a moral issue, but at this point in time,
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.020]   Jesus said you can't serve God and money.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.980]   And I think that increasingly,
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.620]   if there's ever been a clearer point in time
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.540]   at which people have to look at things squarely and say,
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.620]   is this where I wanna invest my money?
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.060]   And I would say that the corporate financial industry
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.340]   has been a major cause in many of those problems,
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.140]   where every single month, billions of dollars
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.260]   just automatically get funneled into Vanguard,
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.380]   automatically get funneled into a 401k.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:21.380]   And so there's not a pushback by those investors.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   They don't know what they're invested in.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.100]   It's not like they own shares of Facebook,
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.940]   and then they look and see what Facebook is doing
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.180]   and censoring people and shutting people down
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.300]   and deplatforming, and they say,
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.100]   oh man, I should sell my Facebook stock.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.260]   Nobody knows, you can't figure out what you own
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.300]   when you own an index fund.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.340]   You can't figure out what you own
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.540]   when you own an actively managed fund.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.460]   And so people just wash their hands of it,
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.500]   and they say, I'm not involved.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.160]   So to your answer, I mean,
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.820]   I don't own any publicly traded companies.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:56.380]   And at this point in time, I cannot, of good conscience,
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.740]   invest in a broad-based fund where somebody is going
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.700]   to engage in something that is harmful,
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.020]   and they're going to profit off of it.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.660]   The utter hypocrisy that you see in corporate America,
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:15.420]   words fail to describe the absolute hypocrisy.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.860]   But everybody worships at the almighty dollar,
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.340]   and it almost doesn't matter the harm
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:24.840]   that you inflict on people in terms of the businesses
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.860]   that are gonna be involved in.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.160]   And so at this point in time, it's hard for me to see
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.140]   how a thoughtful person who cares about that
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.300]   can't at least wrestle with these things.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.260]   So my answer is pretty clear.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.660]   I mean, you've heard it, is that I'm not going
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.540]   to be complicit in that.
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:44.740]   Now, I've often wondered, am I wrong?
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:49.380]   And I've often wondered, could I go back into that world?
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.680]   Could I engage in that business again?
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.020]   Maybe someday you can, and I'm not gonna accuse
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.780]   somebody else of sin because they own an index fund.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.460]   But for me, I just look at it, and when I compare it
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.620]   to the things that could be done,
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.780]   I don't want any involvement with it.
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.820]   It's a corrupt, morally bankrupt industry,
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.180]   and it's not helpful.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.580]   Now, does that mean that you can't invest money profitably
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.920]   and become very wealthy?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.620]   No, there's a world of investments out there.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.340]   And I have no problem with owning publicly traded companies.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.740]   I'm much more comfortable with it
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.900]   if you own individual companies that you can say,
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.700]   okay, they're not destroying the world.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.180]   They're not raining bombs down on people
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.300]   'cause they're brown.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.540]   They're not trying to manipulate the public.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.940]   They're not engaged in something that's immoral.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.420]   But when you open up investing and bring it locally,
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:46.300]   which is, I'm convinced, probably the best solution,
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.980]   then all of a sudden, now you have much bigger options.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.540]   Because here's the challenge, and this is where,
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.940]   whenever I speak about these things,
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.380]   I get an inbox full of people that say,
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.940]   call me a bigot and whatever other insult.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.620]   But here's the reality.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.660]   If I'm investing in a local business
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.620]   where I know the people and I know the industry,
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   then I can do, I can assure that something is rightly done.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.100]   For example, there's a big difference.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.460]   When I used to, when I worked for a big company,
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.100]   let's talk about diversity and inclusion, right?
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:25.180]   You brought up how do we deal with LGBTQ questions,
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.980]   we finish up Pride Month, et cetera.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.220]   It would not bother me in a business that I'm running.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.580]   I would hire gay people all day long
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.780]   if they were qualified for the job.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.660]   Because in my opinion, it's not right,
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.540]   I'm not trying to discriminate against a person
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.280]   for their sin in terms of hiring them in my company.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.460]   Because if I'm gonna do that,
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.460]   I've got to have a very challenging road to hoe.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.500]   How do I deal with somebody's adultery?
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.300]   How do I deal with somebody's lying?
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.180]   How do I deal with somebody's homosexuality, et cetera?
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.580]   There's a big difference between me running a business
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.100]   or being involved in that,
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.260]   where we can actively hire people
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:09.580]   without regard to things that we think should,
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.620]   without regard to lifestyle decisions
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.740]   that we believe are immoral.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.180]   But there's a big difference between that
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.220]   versus a big publicly traded company
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.940]   having a diversity and inclusion committee
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.240]   saying our goal is to go out
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.180]   and hire a certain percentage of people
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.620]   who engage in homosexuality
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.660]   or a certain percentage of people
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.460]   who have a certain skin color, et cetera,
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.300]   so that we can reach the Human Rights Commission
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.820]   or whatever the ranking is,
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   so that we can be well ranked for the Pride March.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.140]   There's a major difference between those two things.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.380]   And so that's what to me is probably under discussed
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.340]   is the key is to have control.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.280]   And I support people's rights to discriminate.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.260]   I think that all of us have the right to discriminate
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.300]   on any basis we want to,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.000]   and I'll defend that left, right, and center.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.920]   You have the right to discriminate in how you hire.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.220]   You have the right to discriminate in who you hire.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.060]   You have the right.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.580]   I cannot come in and tell you
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.160]   who you should hire and what you should do.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.700]   But that doesn't automatically mean
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.820]   that my goal is to say, to take a company and say,
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.980]   "How can I discriminate against this class of people
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.700]   "or this group of people," et cetera.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.940]   So there's my answer to your question
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.040]   is I'm bothered by many of those same things,
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.220]   and I want very little part of it.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.940]   I don't deny that.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.300]   I'm not saying that's for everybody,
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.100]   but I can no longer participate in that world
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.660]   in clear conscience.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:37.060]   - Well, I love it, Joshua.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.060]   I appreciate that fabulous answer.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.980]   I love the depth of your answer.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.020]   And my follow-up question to that would have been,
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.660]   and I think you pretty well addressed it,
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.100]   would be if not the stock market
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.540]   and wanting to invest for long-term, say, retirement,
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.060]   if not for the stock market,
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.940]   knowing my money's gonna grow with the economy,
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.220]   then what?
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.820]   And you're kind of driving it towards local businesses
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.180]   and your own businesses.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.580]   I know, I mean, my son is a small business owner,
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.740]   and he does do stock market mutual fund investing
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.160]   through an advisor,
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.100]   but he puts the vast majority of his money
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.540]   back into his business
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.660]   because he knows his profit margins,
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.900]   and he said, "I'm gonna make a lot more in my business
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.700]   "than I will in the stock market."
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.340]   So that's--
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.660]   - Yeah, and in addition-- - So it--
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.940]   - Yeah, I am, and just what I would say
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.340]   is if you're talking about it
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.380]   from the perspective of Christian ministry as well,
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.260]   which obviously you are,
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.820]   one of the major benefits that you have
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.340]   when you're involved in a business
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.660]   that actually hires people,
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.180]   when you're involved in something
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.980]   where you can actually make an impact,
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.220]   is you have the opportunity to provide work for people,
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.860]   and that's what, to me, has been a major change.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.780]   I used to have thousands of dollars invested
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.900]   in publicly traded companies.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.820]   They don't care what I say,
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.580]   they don't care what I do,
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.740]   they don't care about me,
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.460]   and I get no benefit from that company whatsoever
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.860]   except possible changes in share value
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.080]   and maybe a dividend if they pay me a dividend.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.020]   But if we change that,
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:20.020]   if I start a bakery in my local community,
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.980]   and I'm running a local bakery,
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.820]   then I have the opportunity to hire
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:29.580]   the kid who just got expelled from school who needs a job.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.660]   I have the opportunity to hire the person
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.660]   who can't get a job
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.680]   because their face is covered with tattoos.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.540]   I have the opportunity to hire the person
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.380]   who went through a sex change surgery
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.900]   and nobody wants to give him a job now.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.460]   I have the opportunity to employ those people.
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.140]   And when you look at the breakdown and the collapse
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.700]   in many of our communities,
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.900]   if more people stopped sending their money to Vanguard
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.220]   and started investing it in their local community,
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.980]   it's possible that that could make a big difference.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:03.340]   I don't know if I'll do radical personal finance for,
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.060]   I don't know how long I'll do it.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.160]   But the thing that frustrates me deeply about this business
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.660]   is although it has a whole long raft of opportunities,
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.900]   I can't hire anybody.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.260]   I mean, I can hire people,
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.100]   but the work is so specialized
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.540]   that it's not something where I don't have the capacity
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.260]   to employ people.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.060]   And I look around and I see so many people who need a job,
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.340]   who need training, who need instruction.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.900]   And I think the best way to do that
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.980]   is often through a company.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.840]   And so I can't tell other people
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.900]   what they can do with their time or their money,
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.700]   but I see many more opportunities
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.300]   of being involved in that kind of business
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.200]   where you have an opportunity
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.580]   to not only invest very profitably,
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:48.540]   but now you have something
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.820]   that I can actually do some good in the world.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.580]   And unlike a company that makes their,
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   their living building bombs,
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.700]   you can actually do something
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.980]   that helps your local community.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:02.740]   So I don't know how to teach it all.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.860]   I'm doing it privately,
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   trying to do my very best to learn
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.340]   'cause it's a skill set I wasn't prepared for.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.500]   I spent a decade sowing myself
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.260]   to learning about the stock market.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.460]   And at this point, I'm done with it.
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.500]   I don't care.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.700]   I don't wanna be involved in it.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.100]   I wanna be involved with people
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.260]   and I wanna be involved with my local community.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.180]   So there's my answer.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.420]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.260]   Well, I love it.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:23.920]   And that's the thing I wanna,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.180]   I wanna handle this well from a Christian moral standpoint,
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:31.740]   but then I also wanna be investing to get wealthy.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.540]   I'm just investing to be able to,
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.720]   I don't really have,
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.980]   I'm just investing so that someday
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:40.500]   if I ever want to or have to quit working,
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.780]   then I'll be able to take care of my family
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.200]   and 'cause I mean, I'm in a,
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:53.020]   talk and think I'm gonna be okay, right?
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.320]   From a physical longevity standpoint.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.780]   But hey, I really appreciate your time and your experience.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.620]   - My pleasure, yeah.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:04.540]   I don't see a reason not to be actively involved
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.820]   in the investment marketplace.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:09.380]   And one of the problems I think about a lot,
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.780]   a godly man leaves an inheritance
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   to his children's children.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.260]   That inheritance might be morality
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.940]   and character and many things,
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.940]   but I think it also comes in big time into money.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.220]   We go now, next caller.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.180]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.740]   How can I serve you today?
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.100]   - Hey, my name is Art Crimpon.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.180]   I'm calling from, well, I'm calling from UK number.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.780]   I'm actually based in Egypt.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.640]   I'm listening to you from Egypt.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.500]   I'm a long time listener.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.340]   I used to listen from Angola.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.460]   When I lived in Angola,
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.700]   we had a huge commute three, four hours every day.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.860]   And I used to listen to your shows,
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.700]   literally three, four hours every day.
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.700]   I probably listened to 95% of Radical Personal Finance shows.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:59.260]   I just skipped the ones that I completely,
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.760]   America centered.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.780]   I have a short message or question.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:09.440]   Message is that just enormous thanks for what you do,
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.860]   for the content that you put out.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.860]   And I want you to know that even though
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.700]   a lot of the things that you've got
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.740]   and a lot of the examples that you use
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.020]   is related to the US,
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.500]   US stock market, 401k, Roth IRA, et cetera.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:33.220]   80% of it, 90% of it is very relevant at its core
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:39.340]   to any country, any situation, any culture,
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.780]   because personal finance,
[01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:43.300]   it really doesn't change from place to place.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:46.100]   Some of the things might change,
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.700]   but the core message is the same.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.940]   Doesn't matter if you're in Angola,
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:51.420]   if you're in Egypt, if you're in Portugal,
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.380]   it's the same.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:57.380]   So it's been extremely useful, everything that you do.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.160]   Now, in terms of the question,
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.100]   we had actually a couple of exchanges about this
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.200]   on Twitter before.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.060]   And you answered one of my questions in the previous Q&A
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.300]   that I also submitted on Twitter.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:16.820]   But I'm grappling with this situation.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.860]   I have a high paying, a well paying job.
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.500]   I'm an expert.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.540]   I'm not actually originally from Egypt or from Angola.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.940]   I'm from Europe, but I've been living overseas
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.500]   for 80 years now, 70 years now.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.420]   And as an expert, I've always been on a very good pay
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.740]   and package.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:42.340]   And I've been able to save and invest.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:45.220]   And I have just over a million dollars now
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.620]   in overall portfolio,
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.460]   which is invested in various things,
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.500]   stock market and dividend investing,
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.780]   which we'll discuss today,
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.900]   and some of the P2P loans and various things.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.540]   It produces quite a lot of income.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:05.140]   I'm targeting about $50,000 of investment income,
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.800]   passive income for this year, for 2019.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:13.180]   My plan is, or better to say,
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:18.180]   my plan was to eventually retire
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:23.300]   and go and live overseas, probably in Asia for some time,
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.700]   a place where I can use not even all of my passive income,
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.380]   just all of my passive income to have a comfortable life.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:35.160]   And then still be able to reinvest the rest of the income.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:40.020]   And now when I get to a point where I feel like
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.540]   numbers make sense and I can actually do it,
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:47.260]   I can actually pull the trigger and fire, as they say,
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.020]   and actually retire.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:54.020]   And I don't feel confident doing it.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:59.340]   Not in a way that I'm afraid that numbers
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.780]   are gonna make sense, I'm afraid that numbers
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:01.700]   are not gonna work.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.220]   I am confident numbers are gonna work.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.020]   And even if they don't work, even if something happens,
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.700]   I've got enough runway to change my mind
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.980]   and do something else.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.340]   Even if I retire and something happens
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.380]   three years down the line, that's okay.
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:18.300]   I still have five, 10, 15 years of runway
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.120]   to do something else.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.260]   But I feel that,
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:31.900]   I feel that if I walk away from this career and job,
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:36.180]   I kind of completely lose my identity.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.820]   I lose everything that I was working for for a long time.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.060]   And I don't know how to,
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:45.460]   I don't know what am I going to do, essentially.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.460]   And I just wanted to, I wanted you to talk about
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.740]   how, what is the best way to approach it?
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.220]   What kind of framework you would use
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.180]   to prepare yourself for this life
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.660]   after being financially independent?
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:06.860]   And I don't want to, I'm not saying I don't wanna work.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.660]   I'm just saying I don't wanna work
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.220]   in a sort of corporate structure,
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.940]   which is very rigid, very limiting.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.380]   I want to do something else.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.900]   - Right.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:20.180]   How old are you?
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.140]   - Excuse me?
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.720]   - How old are you?
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:31.300]   How old are you and do you, are you?
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.660]   - I'm 32.
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.580]   I have a family.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.420]   I have a wife.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.340]   She's a stay-at-home mom.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.260]   We have four kids,
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.860]   from very little one to 16 year old.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.460]   So we have kids.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:55.940]   And I'm prepared to, if I would retire
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.220]   and I would go traveling,
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.780]   I'm prepared to live with the kids.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.940]   I have a plan for that.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.140]   I have a couple of kids actually in the border of Scotland,
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.580]   so that wouldn't be a problem.
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:08.860]   So from family-wise, it's not really a problem.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:09.980]   I know it's a problem for a lot of people,
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.860]   but really not for me.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.900]   My problem is more sort of, you know, mental issue.
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.580]   (phone ringing)
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:28.300]   - This call is being recorded.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.020]   - That's it, I'm gonna quit making money.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.860]   And then we just walk away because you can.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.980]   There are a whole lot of worthy causes,
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.780]   a whole lot of worthy people that aren't gonna get supported
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.340]   because you don't have the money.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.620]   So we shouldn't just walk away
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.780]   from one of the most powerful things we have,
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.700]   which is a substantial income that we don't need
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.540]   just because we can.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.660]   But by being financially independent,
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:53.020]   you can now consider a whole breadth of options
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.420]   that might be compelling to you,
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.340]   even options that you couldn't do if you needed money.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.980]   So on the orphanage example,
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:06.340]   maybe you recognize that you don't necessarily want to work
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.700]   to earn money to support an orphanage,
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.020]   but maybe that orphanage needs a father.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.220]   And maybe because of the fact
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.500]   that you are financially independent,
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.420]   you can comfortably move to Angola
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.900]   or open an orphanage in Egypt
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.980]   or wherever you happen to be in the world.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:26.540]   And you can, while you're raising your biological children,
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.500]   you can sow yourself in the lives
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.340]   of a dozen or two other children that need you.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.020]   And you don't have to go and ask for support
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.900]   or solicit donations or funds.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.020]   You can just simply go and do it.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.300]   Or whatever else is appropriate to you.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:46.300]   So I don't see any reason for somebody to quit their job
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.260]   if they don't have something more compelling.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.100]   Now, if you need to make changes to your job,
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.980]   maybe you're working too much now,
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.820]   tell your boss, "I'm not gonna work this much.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.180]   I've got young children, I'm gonna work less."
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.380]   If you're in a really bad job,
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.180]   you're doing something that's not good,
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.220]   by all means quit.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.380]   Quit and take a sabbatical
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.180]   and go look for something better.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.460]   That's one of the benefits of financial independence.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.620]   But why stop working
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:14.100]   unless you have something more compelling?
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.340]   So that's my answer.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.460]   I don't see any reason to just run away from work
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:20.780]   simply because you can.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.620]   You're giving up a major part of your life.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.780]   You're giving up a major part of your identity.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:28.140]   And you're giving up one of the most powerful tools
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:32.740]   you have to make change and accomplish good in the world.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.100]   Go ahead with your response.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.580]   I know you've dropped off a couple of times,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.500]   but go ahead with your response there.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.980]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.300]   And I do feel the same.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:47.300]   I do feel that it's a great asset on its own.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.340]   Having a good job and a good career
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.420]   and a reputation in the industry is an asset on itself.
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.700]   So by just walking away, you kind of give up this asset
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.020]   and there'll be nothing else that you have lined up
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:02.580]   or planned to jump to,
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:05.260]   then it doesn't really make sense.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.540]   Maybe as a follow-up,
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.580]   moving from a sort of high-paying career or job
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.100]   to let's say, working in an orphanage,
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:18.340]   it requires also kind of a mindset change
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.740]   'cause it's been drilled into me
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.860]   and I think a lot of people,
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.580]   a lot of people in corporate world,
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.180]   it's been drilled into you that
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:31.300]   your self-worth equals your net worth.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:37.420]   And it's just very difficult to move away from,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.380]   like one of the most difficult things for me
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.820]   thinking about financial independence
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.380]   is that my net worth is probably not going to grow
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.980]   that much anymore.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.900]   So right now, I'm tracking it, I'm tracking it monthly,
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.980]   I'm tracking my investments,
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.780]   I'm tracking my dividends,
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.980]   when I get dividends, how I've already invested,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.580]   it's just such a huge part of my life.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:01.140]   Seeing that Excel spreadsheet with my net worth
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:05.060]   and how it goes up, it just validates what I do,
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:08.060]   it validates my effort, it validates all the late nights
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.820]   and all the hard work that you do.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   And not seeing it, I'm afraid of not seeing it in the future,
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.340]   I just gonna feel like a loser.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.220]   That's what I'm afraid of.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.180]   And I know that it's wrong,
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.260]   I know that you shouldn't be optimizing your life
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.740]   just for highest possible net worth
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.700]   because it doesn't make sense,
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.860]   you're gonna die anyway, you're not gonna take it with you,
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.100]   it just doesn't make sense.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.220]   But somehow it's been drilled into you
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:38.220]   by IT, by the environment, by the company, by whatever,
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:39.700]   it's been drilled into you.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.460]   And how do you begin to change your mindset
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:48.460]   from optimizing your life for growing the capital,
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:53.860]   from accumulating capital to changing this mindset
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:56.180]   and actually start with maybe even deaccumulating
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.860]   and focusing on other things.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.540]   How do you make this step?
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.220]   - So first I would say, I'm not necessarily recommending
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:10.260]   that you do lower your income.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:13.100]   I think that's a false choice.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.100]   You don't have to lower your income.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.540]   And that's what, to emphasize it,
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.860]   you don't have to go from having a high paying job,
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.900]   a great career, and then all of a sudden believe
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.300]   that the only moral choice available to you
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:30.140]   is to go and not earn any income
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.780]   and go and run an orphanage in Angola.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.020]   That's not at all what I would say.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.060]   I would not say that.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.180]   My point in using an example like that was to say
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.420]   that it could be open, there could be opportunities
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.260]   open to you because of your financial independence
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:52.340]   that you wouldn't have felt previously were open to you.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.380]   Especially as a father, if you're a father of four children
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.780]   it would be unusual that a father of four children,
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.980]   especially if they're young, would feel good
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.380]   about saying I'm gonna go from a life
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:05.300]   where I can support my children adequately
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.420]   and in comfort to a life of poverty
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.860]   and do that with a clear heart, unusual.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.380]   So financial independence could be the opportunity
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.740]   where you could say I can provide for my children
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.140]   but I can also do something else
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.300]   that can't easily be paid for.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.300]   But you shouldn't necessarily start with that.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.820]   First, I would say just consider continuing to work
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.420]   in the career that you have.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.540]   Why change if it's not causing problems to you?
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.900]   But if you are thinking about going to something else,
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.260]   is there somewhere else where your talents and skills
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:40.220]   can be useful where not only can you have a bigger impact
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.860]   but you can make more money?
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.900]   I think the best way to think about money and income
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.900]   is related to service.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.060]   The way I answer every call on this show
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:50.340]   is how can I serve you today?
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.580]   And I do that intentionally because I want to be a servant.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.020]   It comes down to Jesus said,
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.300]   "The greatest among you would be the servant of all."
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.700]   So those who serve the most people
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.020]   and who serve the most effectively
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.820]   are by definition the greatest.
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.940]   So the way up is not to say I'm going to lord over people
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.620]   or coerce people or force people
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.060]   or take advantage of people.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.180]   The way up is to serve.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.780]   That's how God designed the world.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.100]   And you see that reflected when you see a healthy market,
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.780]   a healthy, even a healthy company.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.740]   And so the way to earn more money is not to see that somehow
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.420]   if I earn more money, I have to do more evil.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.460]   Certainly there are people
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:30.460]   who have made that bargain with the devil,
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.060]   but that's not necessarily the case.
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.500]   Generally, the people who serve more
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.780]   and who serve more effectively will often get paid more
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.820]   and get paid more handsomely.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.580]   So I would look at it and say,
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:46.460]   what's the next rung on the career ladder?
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.540]   What's the next job?
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:50.180]   What's the next position that would fit in
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:52.180]   with the things that are important to me
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:55.220]   that would work with the skills that I personally have
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.380]   so that I can more effectively serve more people
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.700]   and make more money?
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:00.300]   Why sit around and stagnate?
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.660]   Why sit around and just say,
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.060]   well, I'm not going to make any more money
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:05.180]   or I'm going to walk away from earned income.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:08.100]   Why not continue to embrace the thrill of the competition
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:11.860]   to continue to engage with the world and the market
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.820]   and move on to something bigger and better?
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.140]   I don't want my business to have the same profitability
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.900]   next year as it has this year.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.660]   I want it to be far more profitable.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.060]   I want it to be far more profitable 10 years from now
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.140]   as it is today.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.180]   But the only way that's going to happen
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.660]   is if I serve more people effectively.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.300]   That's how business works.
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.180]   So you look around and you say, who do I serve?
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.660]   Well, I serve my coworkers.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.900]   I serve my boss.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.620]   I serve the people who work under me.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.420]   I serve the people who work over me.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.140]   And all of us collectively are serving our customers.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.740]   But as we do that more effectively, we make more money.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:45.660]   As we make more money collectively, I make more money.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.100]   As I make more money, I grow wealthier
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.580]   and I'm able to save more, to spend more, give more.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.500]   So why not go the next stage up on the career ladder?
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.940]   Why not look for something that's bigger and better
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:58.860]   and more exciting?
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:30:59.980]   That's what I would say.
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.740]   And just make sure that it doesn't cause a problem
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.660]   with something else that's important to you.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.900]   For example, I wouldn't take a job that paid me double
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.540]   if it meant that I had to be on an airplane every week away
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:11.820]   from my young children.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.940]   That might be fine if I'm 60 and I don't
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.260]   have children in the house.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.180]   But it's not OK for me as a young father.
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.620]   So that would be too big of a cost
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.700]   on something that's important to me
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:21.780]   that I can't compensate.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:24.500]   I could buy my wife three maids, but that's still
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.060]   not going to compensate for my presence in the home.
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:28.740]   So I wouldn't take that job offer.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.500]   I would wait till I was 60 to do that.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:34.140]   But as long as you're not compromising something else
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.660]   that's important to you, why not take the job that's
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:37.460]   bigger and better?
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.460]   That's what I would say.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.980]   OK, thank you.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:47.020]   So yeah, what you kind of lead me to
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:50.820]   is that I can use the capital and the income
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:57.700]   as sort of a stepping stone for, let's say, a career change.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.900]   And then initially, yes, it can cost money
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:03.420]   and it can cost some of the income because you're changing
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.900]   jobs, you're changing careers.
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:09.020]   But you do it with a view to find
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:13.820]   a better fit for your skills, personality, talent,
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.900]   and then potentially through serving more people,
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.820]   make more money in the future.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.860]   So it doesn't need to be--
[01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.340]   finding a better fit does not necessarily
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:26.620]   need to be a step down.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:27.260]   I understand.
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:28.740]   Thank you.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:29.460]   All right.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.820]   Yeah, and I would say it doesn't need to be a step down.
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:35.020]   And oftentimes, the alternative as far as if you just
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:38.980]   take something that pays less money, oftentimes that
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.420]   isn't going to work out as well.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:44.140]   Who has more personal freedom, the CEO of a company
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.140]   or the entry-level secretary?
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.980]   The CEO has unlimited freedom.
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.780]   He can come and go as he likes.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:53.580]   He can come and he can travel the world.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.100]   He can do anything.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.860]   He's responsible for the big results, the big pictures.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.180]   And yet, he has huge amounts of freedom.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.260]   The new secretary that comes in, he's got all kinds of problems.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.340]   He's got to be there at 9 o'clock, leave at 5 o'clock,
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.460]   and only makes a little bit of money,
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.380]   has almost no personal freedom.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:12.980]   And so there doesn't have to be this connection where somehow,
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:15.980]   by definition, as you go up and earn more money,
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.020]   you lose freedom.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:19.820]   Now, there is a component where, as you
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.180]   take on more responsibility, it will be more wearing to you.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.900]   The CEO who's responsible for the jobs of hundreds
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.220]   of people, who's responsible to his board of directors,
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:31.340]   et cetera, will have more stress and has more responsibility
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:32.460]   than the secretary.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.380]   The secretary simply has to come on time
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.540]   and do the job that they're given on time.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.780]   But the CEO has many more responsibilities to do.
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.780]   So you do have to balance that.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:44.220]   I'm not convinced that being CEO of a huge company
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.780]   is necessarily the best thing for everybody.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:50.660]   But I don't think it should just be dismissed by definition.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.940]   The bigger, better job, the higher paying job,
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.100]   is not by definition more constraining or more difficult
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.540]   or something not worth looking at.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.980]   In fact, I think it's the opposite.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.460]   If you're going to make an argument,
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.900]   I think the argument goes in the opposite direction.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.460]   Good question.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.000]   I thank you for listening to the show
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.940]   as you have traveled around the world.
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:10.860]   And I love-- that's what I love about podcasting,
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.260]   is from now on, I'll picture you or someone like you listening
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:19.180]   to my show as they sit through Angola traffic.
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.460]   So thank you very much for calling in.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.780]   That's it for the live call-in questions for today's show.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.700]   I'm going to take one more question, though,
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.460]   that a patron wrote in for the show who
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.340]   wasn't able to call in live.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.980]   Patron writes in and says this.
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:33.500]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.820]   My wife and I are having trouble deciding where
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.060]   to go next in our portfolio.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:43.620]   We both max out our 401(k) accounts, both Roth and non-Roth
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.940]   contributions.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.740]   Our modified adjusted gross income
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:49.700]   is above the amount allowed for Roth IRA
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.020]   and the traditional IRA deduction.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:55.100]   We have two rental properties that have good cash flow.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.360]   No doubt, no debt except mortgages
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.420]   on my primary and the two rentals.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:03.740]   Ideally, I would like a place to access money easily in my 50s.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.780]   I'm 34, and my wife is 31, to achieve
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.300]   early financial freedom.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.820]   Not necessarily thinking of leaving the workforce,
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.020]   but would like to have greater control over my time.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:15.140]   Any ideas?
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.140]   And I wrote back and asked him if he had any children.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.780]   And he writes in and says, we have a baby on the way,
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.220]   our first, which is due late November,
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:26.380]   and we'll try to have one or possibly two more.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.820]   Now, this question, my answer, will in some ways
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.340]   line up with one of the earlier questions.
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.000]   But in a way, I don't have any good solutions.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.820]   As far as I can determine, there are really
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.500]   only three basic things that you can invest in.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.620]   So one would be paper assets.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.700]   So you can invest in some kind of paper asset or paper
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.260]   investment.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.260]   That could include a stock.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.620]   Could include a bond.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.060]   Could include a mortgage.
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.980]   But any kind of paper asset.
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:57.100]   The second category of investments
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.940]   would be some sort of real property.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.120]   So that could involve a small single family house.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.580]   It could involve a ranch.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:07.180]   It could involve raw timber.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:11.620]   It could involve a condominium in Dubai.
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.060]   But some sort of real property investment.
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.140]   And then the third thing would basically
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.640]   be some sort of business that you
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.940]   have an active participation in.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.220]   So that could be a local McDonald's franchise.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:29.020]   That could be a local construction company.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.660]   That could be a local farm.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.620]   That could be a local medical office.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.060]   That could be a local surgery center.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.460]   I mean, there's no limit to what it could be.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.780]   But as best I could tell--
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:44.020]   or I guess I should maybe add another third thing.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:45.720]   It would almost fall into real property.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.060]   Although real property would used to be real estate land
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:49.460]   and things attached to land.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.740]   But perhaps there's some kind of personal or tangible property
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:54.460]   investment.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.500]   So you could buy classic artwork.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.260]   You could buy gold coins.
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:00.700]   You could buy diamonds.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:05.340]   You could buy old tools and fix them up and sell them on eBay.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:08.580]   You could buy old saddles or make saddles or something
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.580]   like that.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:13.020]   So as far as I can tell, those are the basic categories
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.180]   of investments.
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.060]   Would be some sort of paper asset,
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.740]   some sort of real property--
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:20.900]   I guess I make it four-- some sort of personal property
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.980]   and/or some kind of business that you are involved in.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.140]   And so when you're thinking about investment options,
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.740]   within any category, there's almost an unlimited range
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.580]   of things that could be invested in.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.780]   You could say, well, I want to invest in coins.
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.860]   But then you could get deeper in and say,
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.940]   I want to invest in Austrian bullion,
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.780]   or I want to invest in the Buffalo nickels.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.020]   There's almost no limit to the specifics
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.560]   that you can go into.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.180]   And is one thing better than another?
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:54.980]   Well, I'm certainly not qualified
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.500]   to tell you every good investment
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.940]   asset that's out there.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.700]   I think that comes down to what's available to you.
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.980]   You might have an interest in buying nickels.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.380]   And so you buy nickels, and you stash them
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.780]   in a .30 caliber ammo box, and you stack them up
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.500]   in a secure storage somewhere because you'd
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.500]   like to have some of the benefits of investing
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:13.340]   in nickels.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:15.120]   And I might look and say, I'd like
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.460]   to own this condo in Panama City.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:19.420]   And so I'm going to buy a condo in Panama City
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.940]   because that makes sense to me.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.540]   We all look at these different things.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.580]   But those are the basic categories,
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.700]   as far as I can tell, that exist.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.300]   Once you choose a category that's interesting to you,
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.300]   once you do your homework on it, once you're
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.620]   comfortable with it, I don't see any reason
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.980]   not to just stick with that category.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   So if you have a couple of rental properties,
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:41.940]   then why shouldn't you buy more?
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.460]   If two are good, then probably eight is probably better.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:48.700]   Now, you do, as your portfolio expands,
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:51.300]   you do have to consider if there is something that
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.100]   is going to be problematic.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.260]   So maybe you can manage two rental properties
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.300]   in your spare time.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.100]   Maybe you can manage eight rental properties
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:58.900]   in your spare time.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.260]   But you probably can't manage 80 in your spare time.
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.780]   And so you start to reach a point
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:06.980]   where this particular category of investment
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:10.780]   is not going to turn out well in the long run.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.100]   That's what is so lovely about paper investments
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.020]   through broad stream mutual funds
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.940]   is that there's no limit to the amount of money
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.580]   you can put into them.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.740]   You can put $100,000.
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:19.540]   You can put $1 million.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.540]   You can put $10 million.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.460]   And it's all the same.
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:24.540]   It doesn't change your time commitment whatsoever.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.100]   So that is a major advantage of a paper asset
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.900]   that it's less complex.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.780]   You can buy a few thousand dollars in nickels
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.380]   and stash them under your bed.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.580]   A few million dollars in nickels is a little harder
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:39.740]   to figure out how to transport and store and deal with.
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.700]   And so each investment category is going
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:45.180]   to have its basic challenge.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:49.660]   My answer to your question would go back to your life cycle,
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.820]   the phase of your life cycle.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:56.220]   And it would relate to your non-financial goals.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.740]   If we're just analyzing this financially,
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.780]   I think you just say, what do I know?
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.420]   What works?
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.340]   What's going to give me a good rate of return?
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.220]   And do more of that.
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:05.220]   And I don't think you should feel
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:08.180]   like you need to do anything other than buy rental houses
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.860]   and buy mutual funds.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:12.740]   Why should you do any more than that?
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.940]   Unless you have some different vision.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:17.860]   For me, what I find very compelling
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:22.220]   is thinking about my children, thinking about businesses
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.460]   that my children could be involved in,
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:28.300]   and thinking about how to impact the world for good
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.300]   through business.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.980]   That's what came out in the question
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.060]   that the caller asked earlier, where we're talking about that.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:37.980]   I see effectively run businesses as one of the keys
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.060]   of transforming the world.
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:44.500]   So if Facebook has its agenda that it's
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:50.340]   going to aggressively prosecute, or if GE has its agenda,
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.660]   or if Walmart has its agenda, or if Coca-Cola has its agenda,
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.180]   or if Apple has its agenda, and they're
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:00.260]   going to aggressively prosecute their agenda,
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:03.100]   then how am I going to counteract them?
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.740]   Well, I can stand and hold a sign in front
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.660]   of Apple's downtown headquarters.
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:12.140]   What's the point of that?
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.460]   Why bother?
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.460]   But what I can actually do, if I'm really interested in it,
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:20.300]   is I can say, how can I compete with Apple?
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:22.660]   Or how can I compete with Facebook?
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.460]   So if I'm frustrated with what a certain company is doing,
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:32.100]   then my answer is, how can I invest into something that's
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.220]   doing something different?
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.460]   So if I don't like what Apple is doing,
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:40.340]   then who is a competitor to Apple that I can invest in
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.060]   and that I can participate in?
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.300]   Or is there something that I can do to start?
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.500]   Now, I don't have the capacity to start a company that
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.900]   is going to compete with Apple.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.060]   But you might.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:53.620]   I don't have the ability to deal on that level.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.020]   But I can look locally, and I can say, well,
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.460]   I don't like what Walmart is doing down the road.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.060]   So why don't I do this?
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.220]   Or I see this need in my community.
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:04.580]   And I see that children have nothing
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.900]   to do except go home and play video games by themselves
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:07.940]   in the afternoon.
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:11.660]   So maybe I can start a maker space.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:12.220]   You know what?
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.300]   I'll give you my ideas.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.340]   These are mine.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:16.660]   Here are some things that--
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:17.660]   I'm not going to give all of them,
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:18.820]   because I have some that are--
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.660]   but I'll give some that are a little bit lower on my list.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:25.860]   If I close down Radical Personal Finance today,
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.660]   here are some things that I would pursue.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.740]   Number one is I would consider starting a maker space.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.220]   Because one of the--
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:40.260]   and so by way of description, a maker space
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.020]   is basically a facility, picture a warehouse or some sort
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:48.700]   of facility, where there is a community of people coming
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.740]   together who are interested in doing things
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.660]   and who are interested in developing things.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.380]   And there's usually some equipment
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:58.100]   that is available for them, whether it's tools--
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.660]   could be woodworking tools, a table saw, chop saw, et cetera.
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:04.900]   Could be metalworking tools, a lathe, a welding kit.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.340]   Could be a screen printing machine
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:12.740]   to screen print t-shirts or computer equipment or a 3D
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:13.780]   printer, et cetera.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.540]   But usually some equipment.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.900]   But one of the things that I would dearly love to do
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:22.260]   is I would dearly love to start and facilitate a maker space
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:25.380]   in a local community.
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:28.460]   Because I see it as one of the most productive ways
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:31.580]   of developing neighborhood community, especially
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.060]   with young men and women.
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:37.820]   Young men and women, I'm convinced, are wired to learn.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:41.100]   And yet most of the schooling that they are exposed to
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.380]   is designed to destroy their desire to learn.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:47.500]   But if you can give young men and women opportunities
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.260]   to engage with equipment, et cetera,
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:56.740]   then I think that you can have the ability to help
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.740]   and to impact.
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.220]   And that can incubate new businesses.
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:03.220]   It can incubate a new business for a 14-year-old who
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.420]   has an idea and starts designing t-shirts and selling t-shirts.
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:08.660]   And that can be a way for a 14-year-old
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.540]   to earn thousands and thousands of dollars
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:13.700]   that they can't earn if they go and take some dead-end job
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:16.460]   working in a retail establishment.
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:22.020]   Or it can be a way to incubate a new business for somebody
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.380]   who's struggling.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.340]   Joe Smith just got out of jail, and he
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.700]   can't find anyone who will give him a job.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:29.820]   But he can come in and pay $50 a month
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.380]   to rent a membership, to get a membership in the maker space,
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.060]   and can start building cabinets.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:39.140]   And Joe Smith can get away from the difficulty
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.460]   of getting a job after getting out of prison,
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.100]   but can now engage in productive work
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:49.060]   to actually do something interesting.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:51.860]   And so-- sorry, to do something that serves people,
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:52.620]   building cabinets.
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.540]   He doesn't have to go and buy all the woodworking tools
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:55.580]   himself and go into debt.
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.460]   He just needs to buy the membership.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:01.180]   And so I think a maker space is one of the most powerful ways
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:04.900]   that you can provide tools that could help a community.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.180]   So why did I ask about family?
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.340]   Well, what stage are you at with your family?
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.700]   I think about my children, and I think,
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.580]   well, I'd like for my children to have access
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.860]   to all of these things.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.740]   After all, wouldn't it be great if my children
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:21.660]   had a couple of 3D printers, and computers, and CNC machines,
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:23.420]   and woodworking tools, et cetera?
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.800]   Well, if I'm going to start writing checks and stashing
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.900]   all that stuff in my garage, I have
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.460]   the problem of that being a very expensive endeavor
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.900]   and basically having no help.
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:38.180]   But if I start a maker space, I can equip that maker space
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.860]   with dozens and dozens and dozens of tools.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:43.540]   And the development of that maker space,
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:45.780]   with a properly accompanied business plan, et cetera,
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.580]   the purchase of all those tools are now
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.060]   going to be on the business side of the ledger
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.380]   instead of the consumption side of the ledger.
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:55.940]   And now I can equip this, and my children can have memberships.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.380]   And so this is the kind of thing,
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:59.460]   this is the kind of business that I would look at.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:03.140]   And I would say, this allows me to have the opportunity
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.620]   to solve some pressing needs.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.120]   What are these young men and women
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.300]   going to do with their time?
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:10.300]   Instead of sitting around and getting depressed,
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.540]   staring at a screen, let's harness that productive energy.
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:15.780]   Let's facilitate the growth of businesses.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:18.340]   Let's facilitate the growth of entrepreneurship.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.440]   And then by developing a community around that,
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.980]   now we have a platform that could be used
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.740]   to accomplish other good things.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.140]   So now we can provide lectures.
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:30.220]   Now we can provide personal finance lectures and budgeting
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:30.740]   lectures.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.320]   And now I have a facility where instead of me trying to go out
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.420]   and figure out how to rent a hotel room to give my budgeting
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.780]   lectures to help poor people in my town,
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:41.380]   I can invite people into my maker space.
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:43.300]   And now, in addition to the budgeting lecture,
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:45.420]   I can say, listen, we'll help you start a business.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.340]   And I can provide entrepreneurship coaching.
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:49.100]   And I can find all of those retirees
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.180]   in the community who are just sitting around doing nothing,
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180]   playing golf all day.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.680]   And I can say, why don't you come in?
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.260]   And would you come in and help mentor
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:00.740]   some of the new aspiring entrepreneurs?
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:05.420]   And I can bring in people like that.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.900]   And they can volunteer their time.
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:07.660]   And they can help.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.740]   And we can start to create a business culture.
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:12.460]   And in the same way, I can facilitate.
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:16.980]   We can use the facility for religious meetings
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:17.900]   on the weekend.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:20.740]   We can host seminars to help people on everything.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.780]   And now I have a space that can serve as a community hub.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:27.380]   And so I get the benefits of having a place for my children
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.120]   to be with their friends, to build community
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.940]   in the local area, to preach the gospel,
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.820]   to help people build wealth.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:34.980]   I can do seminars.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.740]   I can have a library of books that are just not going
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:39.540]   to be available at the library.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:41.340]   And so that's the kind of business
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.340]   that I would pursue that I think is one of those where you
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.380]   can tick multiple boxes off.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.500]   You can have a lot of opportunities.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.700]   And it's good for me.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:52.660]   It can be very--
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.300]   it could be very profitable.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.780]   You'd have to run it.
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.740]   And I think that depending on--
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:00.140]   to see what kind of profit margin there is with it.
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.140]   But there could be ways to be very profitable.
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:03.980]   And then I would leverage that type of thing
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:05.900]   with my own personal investing.
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:07.620]   So I would seek to be an investor
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.420]   in any kind of business that was incubated there
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:12.780]   in the local community.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:15.420]   So just like-- what's his name out in California?
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.500]   Just like the people do when they incubate tech businesses,
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:21.120]   Russell Graham or whomever, when they incubate a tech business,
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.620]   they're trying to invest and advise.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:26.140]   I want to do the same thing in my local community.
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:27.140]   I can't-- I don't--
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:30.300]   the tech business-- like, that's not me.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.460]   I don't care about that.
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.420]   Maybe you do, in which case you can go do that.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.100]   But I can incubate the cabinet maker.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:39.460]   I can incubate the new real estate investors.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.580]   I can help them.
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:43.100]   I can help the 14-year-old with a screen printing business.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.700]   That's within my circle of competence.
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:48.740]   And so if I'm looking and saying, well, how do I start--
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.500]   how do I invest my money?
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.060]   I would look at something like that.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:53.860]   And I would say, OK, what do I need?
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.260]   $100,000, a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:01.140]   And there's no reason why the whole thing can't be a win-win
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:02.180]   across the board.
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:03.620]   So I'll buy a warehouse.
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.120]   And I'll make sure there's an office building next to that.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.220]   Well, those can be good real estate investments.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:11.100]   And I'll open a co-working space in the office building.
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.700]   And then I'll set up the maker space in the warehouse.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.580]   And it's the kind of investment that gives multiple benefits.
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.940]   It can be profitable, can lead to community building.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.460]   It has huge opportunities.
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:26.140]   Another example of something that I personally would do
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.060]   is I would try to find a business that
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:34.420]   has a lot of low-level employees specifically
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.620]   with an appeal towards men.
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.180]   One of the biggest groups of people
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.620]   that are being left behind, as I record this,
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:47.900]   is groups of men, especially men without high school degrees
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:51.720]   or who just aren't academically oriented.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.860]   And I think one of the best things that could happen
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.100]   is for somebody to get involved and to start
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:58.460]   investing in building businesses and that kind of thing.
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:00.780]   So here, you need to think of something that's physically
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:04.460]   demanding, something that is basic.
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:11.140]   Think of just basic labor types of things.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.060]   You can do this in a construction business.
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:18.220]   You can do this in something like a landscaping business.
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:22.140]   You can do this in something like a tire shop,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.620]   this type of business.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:25.660]   But I would try to develop a business
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:29.740]   and invest in a business that has a lot of young men
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.540]   as employees because then it gives me the chance
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.940]   to do very well financially.
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:36.180]   Some of these businesses can be incredibly profitable.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:39.540]   By going into these kinds of unpopular businesses,
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:40.300]   you have--
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:42.820]   I mean, what's your competition?
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:46.140]   You don't have-- if you go into the tech business,
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:49.060]   you've got cutthroat, very smart people competing with you.
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:51.660]   You go and you start a tire shop,
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:55.300]   you don't have cutthroat competition generally.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.140]   But you have the opportunity to do well financially.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.300]   Some of these things can be very profitable.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:01.940]   I've worked with people in the industry
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.340]   that can be very profitable.
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.720]   But yet, you have the opportunity
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.620]   to hire dozens and dozens of men.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.660]   Now, think about the impact now when you're going to work.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:12.660]   And let's say that you've got 20 young men who work for you,
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:17.460]   who you can now structure your business,
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.900]   opening a range of pizza franchises.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:22.180]   Now you have the opportunity to, in addition
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:25.060]   to having the basics of the job, but you have the opportunity
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:26.380]   to teach life skills.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.080]   You have the opportunity to hire somebody
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:31.980]   who's failing in life, who has no future, no possibility,
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:32.780]   and bring them in.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:34.720]   And through work, they can develop character.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:35.760]   They can learn knowledge.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.820]   You can facilitate education for them.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:40.740]   And that can be done through business.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:45.140]   I would also pursue things in the world of education
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:46.380]   and schooling.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:49.700]   I'm convinced that the market is wide open
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.900]   for new opportunities and new approaches
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:54.460]   towards education for young people.
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:58.900]   We're stuck with all of these models from the 1300s,
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:02.860]   the 1500s, these insane models of factory schooling,
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.500]   which are destroying people.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:07.380]   But although there is a huge opportunity
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.580]   available in the world of homeschooling,
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:12.980]   most parents aren't taking the time,
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:16.700]   aren't going to have the ability or the resources
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:21.580]   or the self-confidence or the vision to actually homeschool.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.620]   But yet there is an opportunity for new and innovative methods
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:27.700]   of schooling that aren't traditional factory schooling,
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:31.060]   that aren't traditional government sweatshops,
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:33.740]   but that actually help people to learn and develop
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:37.400]   skills for the new world that we're going into.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.100]   And then I think there are some ways that
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.600]   could be a hybrid model where they could be done very, very
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.300]   profitably, where it's not homeschooling,
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.180]   but it's not expensive private schooling
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:49.260]   that you pay teachers tens of thousands of dollars.
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:51.100]   There's a bunch of interesting things.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.660]   So those are just a few that I'm not likely to pursue right now.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:55.900]   I'm going to keep a couple of my other ones close to the vest.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:56.860]   But those are the kinds of things
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.140]   that I would personally look at.
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:52:59.700]   But it's not a financial thing.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.660]   It's a matter of looking at it and saying,
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:06.300]   how do I actually do something and invest my money profitably
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:09.020]   so in addition to the financial return,
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.740]   we also get a people return?
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.140]   Because at the end of the day, who cares about the money?
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:15.020]   What we should care about is the people.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.500]   And yet, that doesn't mean that the money is not important.
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.880]   It just means that we've got to get out of just measuring
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:23.860]   everything by virtue of finances and think about how do we
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:30.100]   establish productive systems that will make a difference.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.420]   Is the difference between a business or an industry
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:35.140]   that's renewable versus one that's just destructive?
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:38.120]   You can go in and you can slice the top of a mountain off
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.100]   and you can pull a bunch of natural resources
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:42.300]   out of that mountain.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.140]   Well, that's fine for a time.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:46.700]   But is there a way where instead of just simply going in
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:49.100]   and destroying something without a plan to make it better,
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:52.580]   is there a way that you can farm something and develop something
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:58.020]   where it's actually going to grow and be productive?
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:59.940]   That's the best I got.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:03.100]   I don't have any more answers.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   I never intended to start a series of shows on this
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.580]   because I've just been busy working on it in my own life,
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:10.500]   trying to find ways to actually do it.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.140]   And it's tough.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:12.060]   It's not easy.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.820]   But if more of us who have money would actually
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.940]   start to work on it and start to develop opportunities,
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.500]   and more of us would actually start
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:23.380]   to think broader than just how much money
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.580]   can I put in the 401(k), I think we
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.060]   can make some major changes.
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.080]   And that would be the type of thing
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.060]   that I would like to see more and more of.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:35.300]   It's one thing to sit around and whine and belly
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:37.400]   ache about what other people should do
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.300]   and why the government is all wrong.
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.820]   It's another thing to actually roll up your sleeves and say,
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:42.980]   I've got this money.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:44.860]   I've saved a few hundred thousand dollars.
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:46.780]   I'm going to go ahead and do this.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:48.340]   And I'm going to make this happen.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:51.060]   And when more of us start doing that,
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.660]   then I think there'd be a lot less need
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.940]   to belly ache about what the government is doing or not
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.660]   doing and trying to coerce people.
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:59.540]   It's our responsibility to take action.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:01.220]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
