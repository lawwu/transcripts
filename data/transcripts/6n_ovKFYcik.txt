[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.160]   Paul's second epistle to Timothy in the first chapter and the twelfth verse.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.520]   The twelfth verse in the first chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320]   For the witch cause I also suffer these things.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.840]   Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.720]   he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   Now it's essential in order that we may truly understand that statement and learn from it
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.840]   that I should remind you of the context.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.400]   So I'm going to read to you from verse six to verse fourteen in that chapter.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.600]   "Wherefore," says the apostle to this disciple of his, this young follower of his, this young
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.480]   minister called Timothy, "wherefore," he says, "I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.720]   up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.960]   For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.360]   mind or discipline.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.880]   Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.800]   thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God, who
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.680]   hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.240]   death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.920]   Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.960]   For the witch cause also I suffer these things.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.600]   Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.320]   Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.200]   is in Christ Jesus, that good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400]   Ghost which dwelleth in us."
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.520]   Now, we are dealing for the fourth time with this great assertion, this mighty asseveration
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   of the apostle Paul.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   Here he is, an old man.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   He is in prison.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.360]   He is in the hands of one of the most capricious emperors that even Rome ever produced, the
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   emperor Nero.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.960]   He may be put to death at any moment.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.520]   He leaves a number of young churches scattered about the various parts of the then civilized
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   world.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.800]   You would imagine that there were no circumstances and conditions more calculated to depress
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.080]   a man and to make him feel full of despair than the conditions of the great apostle.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   And then on top of it all, he gets a letter from a man like Timothy, full of forebodings,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.320]   full of evil prognostications, feeling that with the death of the apostle that everything
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   would probably come to an end, and also expressing considerable fear and anxiety concerning his
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   own safety.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.720]   Well, I suggest that no collection of circumstances are more calculated to fill a man with a spirit
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.480]   of utter dejection, despair, and hopelessness.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   But that is not the condition of this man.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.480]   He reminds the apostle that he is in prison because he is preaching the gospel.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.720]   But he says, "Though this gospel and the preaching of the gospel in a sense has put me into prison,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.240]   it is the thing that enables me to sing in the prison.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   I am not ashamed.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.720]   I am not disappointed.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   I am not unhappy.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.840]   I am filled with a spirit of triumph.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.800]   I am filled with a spirit of exultation and of joy."
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.040]   That is what he is telling us.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.360]   And therefore I am holding it before you because I am suggesting that this is the very essence
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.880]   of the Christian message.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.520]   The Christian message is a message that is offered to us to enable us to live.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   This is not something theoretical, not just some philosophy up in the sky somewhere.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.360]   There is nothing in the whole world that is more practical than this Christian message,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   this Christian gospel.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560]   It is not a theoretical view of life.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.280]   The great thing about this is that it has proved in practice to be a mighty power enabling
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.560]   men to live in a worthy manner and especially to enable them to do what it did to the apostle
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.720]   John, to enable them to become more than conquerors.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.320]   It is a view which enables a man not only to look at life but to look at death, to look
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.240]   at eternity, and still triumph and prevail.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   It is this message that enables a man to look at life at its darkest and starkest and strongest
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   and say, "Nevertheless, I am not ashamed."
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.760]   Well, no, that is the suggestion I am putting to you.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.920]   That is why I am preaching this gospel.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.000]   I am preaching this gospel because it is, I say, the most practical thing under heaven
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.120]   at this moment.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.440]   People think that it is remote.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.560]   People say that it is not applicable to life today, that it does not deal with life, that
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   it is not realistic.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.800]   I am here just to contend that nothing else does help us to live but this and that we
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   are living in a world in which we see everything else breaking down.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   And that is why I exhort men and women and invite them to come and to listen to this.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.080]   And here we have it in the form of a personal experience of this mighty apostle.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   And the great question I say for us is, "How can we live like that?
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.280]   Are we living like this?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.840]   Are we more than conquerors in this world?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   Are we mastering life?
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.320]   Are we going through triumphantly?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   Are we just shuffling through?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.520]   Are we just being battered and buffeted and just managing to stand?
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.200]   Have we had to fall back on some philosophy of stoicism or something like that, which
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.280]   is nothing but ultimately a philosophy of despair?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.560]   Or have we stopped thinking altogether, given up the fight, just saying, "As many have
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.480]   said before us, 'Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.'
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.640]   What's the use of worrying?
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   What's the use of reading or thinking?
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.680]   The great men can't find an answer.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.360]   Who am I to find an answer?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.760]   Don't waste your time.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   Make the best of it.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.680]   Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.960]   There are millions turning to that kind of thinking or absence of thinking at the present
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960]   time.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.560]   Well, now then, I say, the thing we obviously must discover is this.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   What is it that enables a man like this great apostle to be able to utter this glorious
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   "Nevertheless"?
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.000]   Well, now, I've been trying to show you that he himself tells us in this context exactly
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   how he did it.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.560]   It isn't a matter of temperament.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.440]   Thank God it isn't.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.080]   If the gospel can only make certain people happy, well, then it's no gospel.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.200]   But the claim of the gospel is that it can do this to anybody.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.600]   It doesn't matter what you are by nature.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.880]   This gospel, if you truly believe it, can give you the experience of the great apostle.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.520]   No, no, he tells us quite plainly, and that's the thing that he's pressing upon the mind
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   of Timothy.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.880]   He says, "My dear Timothy, you shouldn't be like this.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.960]   I want you to stir yourself up, to pull yourself together.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.080]   Rake the fire of the Spirit that's in you so that it may glow again.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.620]   Remember the things I said to you."
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.000]   In other words, Paul says, "I am as I am because of what I believe, because of my faith
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.920]   in the gospel, because of my faith in the Lord of the gospel."
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.280]   So having established that, I suggested that the next question we ask is this.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.220]   Well, what is this gospel?
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.440]   Can anybody tell us exactly what it is?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.360]   How do we know what is really the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.340]   Is it still the same in the twentieth century as it was in the first?
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.680]   Or do we believe these modern notorious writers who tell us that now man has come of age,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.320]   and because we are in a scientific age, we need a new message and a new God?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.760]   Is the apostle's gospel still relevant?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.360]   That's a very fundamental question.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.080]   And I try to show you that there is only one gospel, and that we know nothing apart from
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.600]   what we have in this book.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.400]   We can speculate, of course, and any one of us can do it almost as well as anybody else.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.620]   But what authority have you?
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.620]   What sanction have you?
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.620]   What proof have you?
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.620]   You have none.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.720]   What do you really know about God apart from what you have in this book?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.660]   Nature takes you so far, but it doesn't take you further.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.920]   It doesn't bring you to a personal God.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.280]   It doesn't bring you to a God of love and mercy and compassion, and yet that's what
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   we all need.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.240]   You can trace his marks in history, but again it's only power.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.760]   There is no knowledge of God apart from what we have in this book.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760]   Very well, we've established that.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.480]   We've got to submit to the message.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.680]   We don't receive the benefits unless we first of all take the message.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:42.920]   And that brings me to my next point, which is this one, and it's a very important one.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   Christianity has nothing to give to anybody who doesn't believe it.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.600]   You see, that's where so many go so wrong today.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.080]   They say, "Your gospel's been preached for 2,000 years, but look at the world," and they
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.880]   think that that's a conclusive argument.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.680]   But of course that misses the whole point.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.840]   As G. K. Chesterton put it so perfectly, "One's Christianity has not been tried and found
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   wanting.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.020]   It has been found difficult and not tried."
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.280]   The world hasn't tried it.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.760]   They seem to think that it's a sort of teaching which can be applied as you apply an act of
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.160]   Parliament and it's going to change the world.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.480]   It has never claimed to do that at all.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   Not a word of that kind is to be found in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:33.120]   No, no, we must take the gospel as it is in the New Testament.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.520]   And it doesn't offer anybody peace, it doesn't offer anybody joy, it doesn't offer anybody
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:46.320]   mastery over life and triumph over circumstances until and unless you believe it and believe
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.800]   it as a whole and believe in the blessed person who makes it what it is.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   You get no benefits from Christianity until you believe the central message of Christianity.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:05.520]   All these things that come to us as experiences are, as it were, the results that follow from
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.440]   our central committal of ourselves to it.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.440]   Very well.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.000]   So it seems to me that the position we've arrived at is this.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.320]   What then is this great message?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.840]   You say I can't get any blessings until I believe the message.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.280]   What's the message about?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.440]   Well, you see, the message starts with this.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.080]   Not my particular problem.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.480]   The message starts with this.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.560]   What is the world?
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   What is the world?
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.080]   It's no use talking about the problems of the world until you know what the world is.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.680]   Where's it come from?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.640]   Are you disappointed?
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.860]   People often are, you know.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.440]   People will use the Christian church as if she were some sort of dispensary, out of which
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.480]   soothing syrups are administered and hypnotics and perhaps an occasional pep pill of various
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.200]   types and colors and kinds.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.160]   But that's not the Christian church at all.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.040]   You say I've got this terrible, I want this and that.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.680]   All right, says the Bible.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.040]   But you know, before we can deal with that, listen.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   In the beginning, God.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.560]   You've got to submit to the biblical method as well as to the biblical message.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.840]   But it won't start with your problem and mine.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.240]   It wants you first of all to know the truth, the whole truth.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.480]   So it takes you away back to the world itself.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   And as I was trying to show last Sunday night, it tells us that there's only one adequate
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.360]   explanation of the world, and that is that it's been created by God.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   It isn't an accident.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.760]   It isn't the result of chance.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.400]   It isn't something fortuitous.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.520]   In the beginning, God created.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   He not only created, he controls, he sustains, he intervenes in it, he does things in it.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.560]   He's got a plan and a purpose who has saved us and called us with an holy calling, not
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.400]   according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.800]   Christ Jesus before the world began.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.040]   Now that's the biblical view of the world and of life in general.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.520]   And it isn't an accident that God started it.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.200]   God started the time process.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   God's controlling it.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   God's going to end it.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   That's the message.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   And God has a great purpose.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.280]   Oh, I would say once more that to me this is the most thrilling discovery a man can
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.080]   ever make, that there is a purpose in life and in this world, and that the whole thing
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.600]   is not some sort of a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.840]   Isn't that?
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.000]   Life is real, life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.200]   The whole cosmos has got an end, and the purpose of God is at the back of everything.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.120]   Now that's the first fundamental statement.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.880]   That's also the point at which we have arrived.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.680]   Now then, what is the next question?
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.720]   Well the next question it seems to me is this one.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.200]   What then is man?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.880]   If you say, says somebody, that the whole universe, the whole cosmos, has a purpose
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.640]   and an end and an object, and that it is in the hand of God, and that God is bringing
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.760]   his great purposes to pass, now where does man come in in all this?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.960]   Well now that's another vital question.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.720]   That's the question I want to put before you this evening.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.360]   And I put it first and foremost to your common sense, to your understanding.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.040]   What is the object or the point or the purpose of considering the problems of men until you
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.320]   know what man is?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.040]   What is man?
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.600]   Obviously your answer to the problems and the questions is going to be determined by
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.000]   your view of man.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.400]   But that's the tragedy today.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.260]   People are ignoring the fundamental questions.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.120]   We are living in a world of activism, and everybody is rushing here and there to solve
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.440]   some particular problem, but the great question is never faced.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.440]   What is man?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.920]   What's he doing here in this world?
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   Where's he come from?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   What's the point in men?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   Is there any?
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:18.240]   Now these are the great questions that obviously must be considered at once, and the apostle
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.120]   does that in a very plain and in a very clear manner here, as I want to show you.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.840]   This is indeed one of the great messages of the Bible.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.680]   The Bible tells us the truth about men, and then having understood the truth about men,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.640]   you'll have light upon the things that happen to him and the only way in which he can be
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   delivered.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.400]   Very well, then I put them as my first question, what is man?
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   There's the question.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.640]   Those old Greek philosophers, they were very wise men and they were very able men and very
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.120]   profound thinkers.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.080]   And the Greeks, having ruminated over life and its attendant circumstances, had come
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:06.360]   to this conclusion, that the essence of wisdom is this, "Know thyself."
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:14.760]   They said there is men's great problem, there is men's biggest question, "Know thyself."
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.640]   How many people really know themselves?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.440]   Of course we think we know ourselves, but we don't.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.120]   We are dishonest with ourselves, we paint our wonderful pictures of ourselves, we defend
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.160]   ourselves and so on, we don't really know ourselves and most of our troubles are due
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.800]   to the fact that we don't know ourselves.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.480]   The Greeks said you must start there, "Know thyself."
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.920]   But here's the question, how am I to do that?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.800]   How can a man know himself?
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   Have you ever tried it?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.040]   If you try it you'll find that it's a terrible problem to know oneself.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.880]   Well, you know the modern world is full of this attempt on the part of men to understand
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.840]   himself and to answer the question, "What is men?"
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   I'm not going to wear you with the various theories that are current and that are popular,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.360]   you are familiar with them.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.280]   One of the most popular today is that men is just a biological being.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:19.720]   You know, this mysterious body of ours and all the discoveries of the last hundred years,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.680]   these ductless glens of ours, vital to life, the things you know that incidentally the
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.120]   scientists of a hundred years ago were dismissing with absolute confidence as vestigial remains
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.560]   which were quite useless.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.160]   Now they find that they're essential to life and they've gone to the other extreme now
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.840]   and they say that man is rarely what he is as the result of the various proportions of
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.160]   thyroid, pituitary, suprarenal glens and the various other glens.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   That's one theory.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:53.520]   Another is more philosophical and says that man is simply the result of the interplay
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.480]   of dialectical forces.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.680]   Man is what he is as the result of supply and demand, political forces and so on.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.080]   Then there's another more sociological view of men which explains him entirely in terms
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:14.280]   of his environment and his particular social environment in which he's brought up.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.520]   Indeed there is a theory which is held by some that what determines entirely what a
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.680]   man is, is geography, even climate.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.360]   You are familiar with that, aren't you?
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.320]   The nearer you get to the equator, they say, the softer people are and the milder, the
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.600]   more emotional.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   The further away you get from the equator, the nearer you get to the north or the south
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.400]   pole, the harder, more intellectual, more resistant, less emotional they are.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.900]   So you see, it's all a question of the latitude on which you've been born and on which you've
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.080]   been brought up.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.400]   These are put forward quite seriously.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.520]   And then the psychological explanations, and this has been so popular.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.560]   Freud, of course, started it.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.840]   And it governs the novels and it governs the treatment of delinquents.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.400]   It's into the prisons.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   It's governing almost everything, education, this view of men in terms of instincts, impulses,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   drives.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.800]   And men is but a bundle of impulses and drives, an aggregated collection of these forces and
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.640]   powers that are inside it.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.480]   Well, there they are.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:23.000]   Now all I'm concerned to say is this.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.480]   Do these satisfy you?
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.120]   Many of them, of course, contradict one another and are mutually exclusive.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.360]   Some of them are optimistic, some are pessimistic.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.520]   There are some people who come to the conclusion that man is hopeless.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.320]   They see no purpose in his life.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.680]   They can't prophesy any end.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.560]   They don't see any end in history or in men.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.360]   Some of the greatest historians have said that.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.880]   They see no line, no objective, nothing moving in a given direction.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.800]   They don't believe in one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.760]   No, no, they say.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.240]   It's either going round and round in circles or it's all pure accident and chance.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.080]   Some of them are optimistic, some are pessimistic.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.160]   But what is common to all of them, more or less, is this.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   That man, in reality, is nothing but an animal.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.440]   They may say that he's a reasoning animal.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.600]   They may make great play of the fact that man's cerebra must develop much more than
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.480]   any other animal, but still he's only an animal.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   He's the highest animal, but only an animal.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   And that we must think of him as an animal.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.120]   And indeed, all those various theories can be reduced to that common denominator.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   They all say that man is just an animal.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:47.200]   However much you may postulate certain faculties and propensities and qualities in him.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.480]   But I say, do these really satisfy us?
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   Are these explanations adequate?
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.720]   Do they really account for men as we know him, even as we know ourselves, as far as
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.840]   we do know ourselves?
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.440]   Let me put just one question.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:12.040]   Do they account for the amazing contradiction that's to be seen in men?
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.400]   What a contradiction men is, modern men in particular.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   Never has men shown the contradictions in his nature more clearly than he's doing
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.920]   at the present time.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.520]   Look at men from one angle and you'll say he's great, he's noble, he's wonderful.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   But then you take another look at him and you say that he's small.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.200]   He is vile, he is ignoble.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.000]   He's ugly.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.360]   And the two things of course are perfectly true.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   Man is a contradiction.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.800]   Look at this very century in which we live and you see the whole thing quite plainly.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.840]   On the one hand you have these phenomenal achievements of modern men, these amazing
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.080]   scientific discoveries and the development of them.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:01.400]   This century has been a tremendous century, an astounding century, in man revealing the
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   greatness of his power and his understanding.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:12.760]   But remember, it's also been the century of Buchenwald and of other concentration camps.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.320]   It's the century of the bombs and of the two most devastating wars that the world has
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   ever known.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:25.800]   It's the century of divorce and infidelity and ugliness and foulness and rapacity and
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.000]   greed and vice.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.160]   The same century, the same man.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:39.200]   This extraordinary contradiction, greatness and smallness, wisdom and folly, here they
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.320]   are all mixed up.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.440]   There's a central contradiction at the very heart of men and all your explanations really
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.840]   don't account for it.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.560]   What is the truth about men?
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.980]   We are still celebrating the fourth centenary of the birth of Shakespeare.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.520]   You remember what he says about men?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.760]   "What a piece of work is men!
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:14.560]   How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, in form and moving, how express and admirable!
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.640]   In apprehension, in apprehension, how like an angel!"
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:26.320]   Indeed, he says he's like a god, a paragon of all.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   Man is a spectacle.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   Now there is Shakespeare's statement about him, but is it the whole truth?
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.000]   Is it really men?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.600]   What a piece of work is men!
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.920]   How noble in reason!
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.560]   Are you seeing it at the present time?
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.480]   How do you think the majority of people in this city of London are spending their time
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.200]   tonight?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.380]   Are they displaying this nobility of reason?
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.560]   Are they giving themselves to pondering the great questions of life and death and eternity
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.320]   and all the problem of men?
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.360]   Are they spending their time like that?
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.800]   Noble in reason, is he?
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   Infinite in faculty, is he displaying that today?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:15.520]   Form and moving, how express and admirable!
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.160]   In apprehension, how like an angel!
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.920]   In understanding, how like a god!
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.320]   Is men displaying that?
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.920]   Now, now, I say this is a partial picture, and Shakespeare, for me to be quite fair to
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.400]   him, he brings in the opposite also.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.680]   He has equal things to say on the other side about men, and he more or less dismisses him
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   as a fool.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   He saw the two things.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   They've always been in men, and you don't describe men truly and accurately until you
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.720]   describe him as a whole and give due weight to the two sides.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.280]   Very well, then.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.280]   What is men?
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.400]   Now, here I want to put before you the biblical view of men.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.040]   The apostle puts it here in a very interesting phrase.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.960]   Come back to this great word of his, "For the which cause I also suffer these things.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.760]   Nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed or in whom I have believed,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.560]   and I am persuaded, I'm perfectly satisfied, that he is able to keep that which I have
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.280]   committed unto him, until or against that day."
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.400]   What is this that he has committed unto him?
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.520]   Now, that's the whole of the biblical teaching with regard to men.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.300]   That is what the Bible calls the soul.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.600]   The apostle says, "I'm in prison, but I'm not ashamed, and I'm not troubled, and I'm
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   not distressed."
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   Why?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.920]   "Well, because I have committed my soul and its safekeeping into the hands of Christ,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.480]   and I know he'll keep it safe.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.800]   Whatever men may do to me, my soul is safe."
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   The soul?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.320]   "That which I have committed unto him."
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.000]   Now, this is of course the thing that makes men, men.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.400]   This is the thing that differentiates men from the animal.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.920]   Now let me quote some words to you, and these are interesting words because they are the
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.880]   words of T. H. Huxley, the grandfather of the present Huxley, Sir Julian Huxley and
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.080]   the late Mr. Aldous Huxley.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.960]   T. H. Huxley was not a Christian, and he was a great supporter of Charles Darwin, and he
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.840]   propagated his teaching perhaps more eloquently than anybody else.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:32.800]   But T. H. Huxley said this, "Between men and the highest beast there exists," and here
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:42.360]   are his words, "an enormous gulf, a divergence immeasurable and practically infinite."
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.160]   Now that's T. H. Huxley.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:51.080]   He says that the difference between men and the very highest animal is a gulf which is
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:27:01.920]   unbridgeable, an enormous gulf with a divergence which is immeasurable and practically infinite.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.000]   And of course that's precisely what the Bible has always said about men.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.040]   And what is it that makes men so different?
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   Well, the answer is this, that man is a creature who has been made by God in his own image
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.640]   and likeness.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.200]   God made the animals, yes, but not in his own image and likeness.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.840]   Man is essentially different.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.440]   He's not just an animal, he's a man.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.360]   That means that he has an intellectual and a moral and a religious nature.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.880]   Man has not only the power of intellect, he has the power of self-examination, self-reflection.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.280]   He can look at himself and he can analyze himself and say things about him that the
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.120]   animal can't do, that man can.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.920]   He's been given this intellectual power which is in God himself.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.320]   God gave something of that to man, intellect, intellectual power and capacity.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   Then a moral nature.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.680]   Of course, you can train a dog not to do things and teach him good manners and various other
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.880]   things, but you see, you never make an animal a moral being.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.240]   It acts instinctively, it knows that if it does a thing it gets punished, so it stops
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   doing it.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.920]   Pavlov has gone into all that and they're now trying to treat men like that.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.960]   I think there's something in it, until they become Christian.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.240]   But the point I'm establishing is this, that you never make an animal a moral being.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   You can't give him a moral nature and the capacity for moral reflection, moral judgment
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.160]   and moral determinations.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.240]   And then above all, of course, this religious character.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.760]   Man said somebody is a worshipping animal.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   I don't like that.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.280]   Man worships because he is man.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.360]   He's not a worshipping animal.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.960]   But man has this sense of the eternal.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.680]   There is in every man a sense of God, a sense of something beyond.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:00.040]   Well, I think I've quoted this before, but the archaeologists and the anthropologists
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:08.760]   in particular have been able to produce irrefutable evidence to prove that even the most primitive
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.920]   races, such as you find in the northwest tip of America and in the heart of Central Africa,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:23.520]   the most primitive races known, all have a sense of a supreme high God.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.040]   Some of them are animists, worship spirits in trees and so on.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.000]   Some of them are idolaters and so on.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.120]   But all of them, even the most primitive, have a sense of a great supreme high God.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   It's innate in human nature.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.560]   Man has got a religious nature.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.400]   Now, the Bible says that he has all this because he has been made in the image and the likeness
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.760]   of God.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.680]   And the thing that makes man man is this particular thing.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.400]   Or, if you like it in other language, man is body, soul, spirit.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.000]   Or, if you prefer it, man is body and soul.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.440]   You may say that the spirit is a section of the soul.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.640]   I'm not concerned to quarrel about that tonight.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:11.800]   All I'm here to say is this, that man has an animal part of his nature, the body.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.840]   The body is very similar to that of the animals.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:23.800]   But you see, what makes man man is this other aspect, this power and capacity that he has,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:29.440]   not only for self-reflection and communication with others, but above all, his capacity for
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:37.680]   God, this spiritual element, this something within him that tells him, as I quoted Longfellow
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.520]   just now in saying, "The dust, though art a dust, returnest was not spoken of the soul."
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.900]   This thing in man that cries out for an emplorita, a diviner heir.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:53.320]   This thing that tells man, as the book of Ecclesiastes puts it, that God has placed
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.000]   eternity in his heart.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.240]   This thing in man that tells him that he's bigger than the world, that he's meant for
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.360]   something beyond himself.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.800]   This is the soul.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:11.160]   Very well then, this is the thing I say that makes man man.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:18.840]   That over and above this bodily animal part, there is this other unseen, yes, intangible
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.520]   part, but which we all are aware of.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.200]   A man can't think of himself as going out of existence.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.280]   You may think, you may say that when you die it's the end, but you can't believe that.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.680]   You can't imagine it even.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.320]   There is something about us that suggests we are immortal.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.920]   That man was not made to die.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.440]   There is this other element which is imperishable.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.880]   Well now, this, I say, is the essence of the biblical teaching.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:50.440]   Here the apostle says, "I am as I am, and I'm able to say nevertheless, because I know
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   my soul is safe, my soul."
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.800]   Let them do what they like to my body, they can't touch my soul.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   He says, "Nevertheless, that's all right.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   It's this."
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.160]   You see, it's the fact that he knows he's got a soul that really gives him this confidence
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   that he's got.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.000]   Now, it's not confined to the apostle Paul, of course.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.640]   He only received this teaching from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, his master, and he
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.120]   put it like this.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.520]   "What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.080]   That's how our Lord put it on one occasion.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.200]   Another occasion he put it like this.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.120]   He told a parable about a very rich man.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.920]   This man was so rich and had done so well that his success had even become an embarrassment
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   to him.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.480]   His barns had become too small to put in all the goods.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   So he said, "What shall I do?
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.840]   Well, I'll pull down these barns and I'll build greater, and then I will say unto myself,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.080]   'So, thou hast much goods laid up for many years.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.480]   Take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.'
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:03.520]   But God said unto him, 'Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.760]   And whose then shall these things be which thou hast provided?'"
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.520]   He'd forgotten the soul.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.640]   Our Lord was always teaching this.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.720]   He teaches it again in the parable of Dives and Lazarus.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.640]   The soul!
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.400]   The trouble with the rich man was he'd forgotten he'd got a soul.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.280]   This is the whole of the teaching of the Bible.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.520]   It starts with it.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:30.920]   Man created in the image of God, a living soul, capacity for God and for eternity, more
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.920]   than animal.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.120]   Here he is.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.160]   This is the essence of man.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.200]   This is what makes man, man.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.280]   I'm not surprised that the modern world is as it is, in trouble and perplexity, full
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.600]   of despair and of hopelessness.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.640]   Modern man doesn't know what man is.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.280]   How can he know what's gone wrong if he doesn't know what he is?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.240]   How can he put things right if he's wrong in his whole conception of himself?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   There's the first thing.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.880]   But let me hurry on.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.840]   What was man meant to do in this world?
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.680]   What was he meant to be?
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.880]   I think that's a very urgent question for this generation, isn't it?
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.000]   What is man here for?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.400]   Is man just an animal?
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.680]   Is he just in the world to eat and to drink and indulge in sex?
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.880]   Is that it?
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.660]   Is that what man's for?
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.400]   Is that man's life?
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.920]   No, no, says the Bible.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:34.840]   Man being made in the image and likeness of God was meant to be the Lord of creation.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.040]   He was meant to be God's representative in this world.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.440]   That is why God gave to him the privilege of naming all the animals.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.600]   He was meant to rule over them and to govern them.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.360]   You see, we are seeing him doing that now in a sense, and yet at the same time, because
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.200]   he is what he is, he's being governed by them in turn.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.320]   And there is this perpetual warfare, man's mastery, man's slavery.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.640]   But he was meant to be master, Lord of creation.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.800]   He was meant to live to the glory of God.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:09.520]   Let me quote again that great answer in the shorter Catechism of the Westminster Confession.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.960]   The first question is this, "What is the chief end of man?"
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:21.240]   And the answer, "The chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever."
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.560]   That is what man was meant to do.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.600]   Is man doing it?
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   You see, these are the whole things that determine our outlook upon man, upon life, upon what
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.920]   happens to us, upon what we can do about it.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.720]   That is what man is meant to be.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.080]   Then let me go on to the next question.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.760]   What was meant to determine man's happiness in this world?
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.240]   We all want to be happy.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.160]   There is nobody who likes and enjoys trouble.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.580]   Man was meant to be happy.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.720]   He was meant to enjoy the fruit of the earth.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.480]   He was meant to live a full life.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   And he was meant to be there in a state of contempt.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.320]   God made him and put him in a place called paradise.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   It was meant to be.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.840]   Well, now, what is meant then to determine man's happiness?
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:12.840]   And here, you see, is the very essence and nerve of the biblical diagnosis of man and
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.120]   his troubles at this moment.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:25.080]   Man's happiness was never meant to be determined by his circumstances.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.840]   And that is the fatal blunder that we all tend to make.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.040]   We think circumstances determine happiness.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.480]   Oh, most of us think, like the men I've already quoted, that what makes a man happy is to
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   have plenty of money.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.040]   They think they can buy happiness, but they can't.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.920]   They can buy pleasure, but they can't buy happiness.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.600]   You can be a multimillionaire and still be miserable.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.200]   You can't buy happiness.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.680]   There are some of them well known.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.840]   One of them was honest enough to admit that he was a great failure in life.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.040]   I can't remember.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.280]   I think he's tried already five times.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:06.560]   But he still doesn't know what it is to be a happy married man.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.080]   And he's the richest man in the world.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.560]   You see, you can't buy it.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.840]   Money is all right, but your happiness in this world isn't determined by money, not
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.880]   by goods, not by possessions.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.120]   No, no.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.320]   Man, because he is what he is, is happy in another dimension.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.200]   As long as man is dependent upon circumstances, he's going to be miserable.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.560]   You see, that's where they go wrong.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.640]   They think, if only we could banish bombs, if only we could put an end to war, if only
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:45.200]   we could do away with prisons or put in some new treatment, if only we were all educated,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.080]   if only we all had plenty of money, if only we all had plenty of drink, if only we all
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.480]   had plenty of dance, if only we all had plenty of sex, ah, then we should be perfectly happy.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   And it's never worked.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.480]   Why?
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.640]   Well, because your circumstances will generally be against you.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.400]   No, no.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   Man's happiness was never meant to be dependent upon his circumstances.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   Man's happiness depends upon one thing only.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   What is that?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.280]   His relationship to God.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.720]   It's the only thing.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.960]   I've quoted this again, but it's such a wonderful statement.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.680]   St. Augustine, that brilliant philosopher, at long last came to see it, having gone all
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.080]   round the world in finding peace and happiness and rest.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:36.280]   "Thou hast made us for thyself, and our souls are restless until they find their rest in
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   thee."
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.160]   You can't get it anywhere else.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   He tried it.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.560]   Philosophy, the mistress, and all the rest.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.840]   No, no.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.560]   You come back to the soul and God who made it.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   You were made for him.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.640]   You were meant for him.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   You have a correspondence with him, and you'll never come to rest until, like that needle
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.040]   on that compass, you strike that northern point, and there you come to rest.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   Nowhere else.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   Very well, where is that next point?
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.600]   Well, now then, that leads inevitably to this further question, which is this.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:18.360]   If all these are fundamental postulates with regard to men, and they are, why is man then,
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:23.120]   as he is, and why is life in this world as it is tonight?
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.600]   Why all these problems?
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.400]   Why all these troubles?
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.800]   Why all the restlessness?
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   Why all the heartache?
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.680]   Why all the bustling attempt to find peace and rest and satisfaction and pleasure in
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.040]   various forms?
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.640]   What's gone wrong?
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.560]   Surely that's the fundamental question.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.360]   If I am to go through this world, able to say with the apostles, "Nevertheless, to
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.520]   whatever happens, if I am to be happy in prison and face to face with death and the end of
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.280]   all things as far as I'm concerned," well then, I say, I must know the answer to these
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.840]   great questions, every single one of them.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.240]   What has gone wrong?
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.640]   Why is life as it is?
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   Why are the men in prison for preaching the gospel?
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.600]   Why are there wars and rumors of wars?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.320]   Why is there dishonesty?
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.880]   Why are vows broken?
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.120]   Why are little innocent children suffering, breaking their little hearts, not knowing
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.940]   a father or a mother's love, buffeted and thrown backwards and forwards at the selfishness
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.940]   of men and women?
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:34.040]   Why all this?
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.360]   And there's only one adequate explanation.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.400]   It's the explanation in this book from the beginning to end.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.800]   Man was made in the image and likeness of God, but he rebelled against it.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.560]   He became inflated with his own importance.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.120]   He wanted to be as God, so he deliberately defied God and broke his commandments and
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.920]   went his own way, and thus he fell.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   What has this led to?
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.000]   Well, it's led to the fact that man has lost the face of God.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.580]   Man is out of correspondence with God.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.160]   Man no longer knows God.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.360]   Man is no longer blessed by God.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.480]   Man, you see, has turned his back upon God and has made himself a God.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.240]   He's become egocentric.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:21.320]   He tries to think that he's autonomous, that he has everything within himself, that he's
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:28.840]   the center of the universe, and that he can plan life and the whole of the universe itself.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   But he finds that he can't do that.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.880]   And why can't he do it?
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.560]   Well, the answer is perfectly simple according to this explanation.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.000]   Man has lost his balance.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   What do you mean, says somebody?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.680]   Well, I'll tell you what I mean.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.760]   Man, I told you, was made body, soul, spirit.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:54.640]   And as God made men, men had this spirit and this rational soul which enabled him to control
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   his body.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.720]   The body has its instincts and its desires.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.480]   Man wouldn't be a perfect man even in a bodily sense unless he'd got these instincts.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:10.720]   The idea that sex is sinful in and of itself is utterly unbiblical.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.640]   And those who taught in the past that sex was sinful per se didn't know their Bibles,
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   they didn't know their Christianity.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.520]   It was a false religion that made them teach it.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:26.080]   No, no, God has made men like this, and there's nothing wrong with our instincts.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.560]   Well, what is wrong?
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.800]   Well, you see, men, as he was made originally and perfectly, he controlled his instincts.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.920]   They were his servants, and he used them not only to satisfy himself but supremely to the
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.480]   glory of God.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.680]   And he was balanced and always happy.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.640]   He lived in the different spheres, on the different realms, and there was a balance
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.200]   and a poise about his life.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:56.120]   But the moment men disobeyed God, he lost his relationship to God.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.080]   The highest faculty of all, the spirit, became dead and non-operative.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:07.040]   Paul, you noticed in Ephesians 2, 1 said, "Heweth he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   and sins."
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.920]   He means they were spiritually dead.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.000]   They didn't know God, they didn't realize there was God, they didn't live in correspondence
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   to God.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.720]   Their spirits were dead, and so they've lost their balance.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:25.240]   Men today are no longer governed by his spirit and his rational soul.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   What's he governed by?
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.160]   He's governed by lust and desire.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.560]   You notice the apostle says that lust can apply not only to the body but also to the
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:41.200]   mind, the desires of the flesh, and the desires of the mind.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.600]   Did you know that the whole world is as it is tonight because of lust, because of desire?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.320]   Man sets himself up as an autonomous, independent unit.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.400]   He doesn't recognize God, he doesn't recognize the laws of God.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   He lives as he wants to live, and he says, "These are my rights.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.180]   Why shouldn't I express myself?
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.840]   Why shouldn't I have what I want?"
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.160]   But the trouble is that everybody else is saying the same thing.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.240]   And so you get jealousy and envy and malice and spite and hatred, and you get rivalries
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.640]   and you get tensions and you get quarrels, and eventually you get wars, nations, the
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.800]   world divided into two, the haves and the have-nots, this side of the curtain, that
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.440]   side of the curtain, all out for the same thing, and all wanting it.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:29.040]   It's all the result of the fact that man has fallen from God, and he's now behaving
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.160]   not like an animal, it's worse.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.120]   Man is more devilish than any animal has ever been or ever will be.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.400]   Man is more fiendish.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.760]   Man's lust is balanced, he's upside down.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:46.000]   The body's controlling the lust, the passions, the desires, and even glories in it.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.800]   And so he's crucifying and has killed that which is highest in him, which is his rational
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.320]   soul and his spirit.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.440]   And so this world is a world of triumph.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.720]   It's a world of shame.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.780]   It's a world of disappointment.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.240]   It's a world of unhappiness.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.600]   That is the only explanation.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.840]   Then I ask my next question, and these all are involved in a logical sequence.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.680]   "Very well, there it is.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.080]   I see, sir, somebody, you've told us now why the world is as it is.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.800]   I want to know one thing more.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.760]   What's the destiny of men?"
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.640]   And this is a tremendous question.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.240]   Is man only an animal?
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:36.840]   And is it therefore true that when he dies, that's the end?
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.160]   No point in life, death, the end.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.880]   Very well, you see, if you take that view, well then I suppose in many ways the logical
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.240]   deduction to draw from all that if life has gone against you is this, "Get out of it.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.240]   Commit suicide."
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.480]   Why go on putting up with it?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:59.720]   Why take up arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them, if you can?
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   Is it worth it?
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   Is it worth the fight?
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.080]   Is it worth the heartache?
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.520]   And so many great philosophers in the past and since then, I mean in the dim distant,
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.320]   in the dim past, in the time of the Greeks and so on, and many since, did go out by means
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   of suicide.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.960]   And it's very logical.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.680]   But you see, death is not the end.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.160]   Man has got this imperishable soul within him.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.680]   The apostle says here, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.280]   to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   That day?
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   What's this?
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.400]   This is the end of the world.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.360]   This is the end of history.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.880]   This is God's final judgment of all men.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.880]   That day.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:51.920]   The apostle, you see, he lives in terms of his soul and life and death and that day,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.840]   that which lies beyond.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.440]   And this is the biblical view everywhere.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.120]   That man is not just an animal.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.720]   That man is a living soul.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   That death is not the end.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.560]   That it is appointed unto all men once to die and after death the judgment and beyond
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.920]   the judgment an eternity.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   That the soul doesn't end.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:20.400]   And that there are just two possibilities with regard to that eternity and that is either
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:27.680]   indescribable bliss and happiness and joy or else indescribable misery and despair and
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.020]   an eternity of useless remorse.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:34.560]   My dear friends, these are the things that determine how you view life in this world.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.840]   These are the things that decide how you live it and how you go through with it.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.800]   Do you know you've got a soul?
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.240]   Do you know that that soul is imperishable?
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.680]   That it will have to stand before God and give an account of the deeds done in the body?
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.840]   This is the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.360]   Our Lord taught it.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:58.160]   This night thy soul shall be required of thee by God.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.920]   And can't you see that these things of necessity determine how a man lives?
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.140]   If I've got a soul, well then I don't live for eating and drinking and sex and the so-called
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.480]   pleasures of the world.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.120]   I don't stop thinking and say let us eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.360]   I say death isn't the end.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   I go on.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   I'm accountable.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.520]   I'm a responsible being.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.960]   I stand before my Maker.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.000]   I give an account of my stewardship, of the powers and faculties he's given me.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.440]   How do I answer him?
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:33.120]   And my whole life is determined and changed by my point of view with regard to these matters.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.000]   And so I leave a last thought with you this evening.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.240]   What comfort then is there and what hope is there for men in the light of these things?
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.880]   We find ourselves in this troubled world.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.160]   What can we do?
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.880]   You've got to ask that question.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:57.560]   Well, to save time, let me put it dogmatically by saying that the biblical teaching is that
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:05.160]   man himself can do nothing about it and that all his efforts will ever prove to be a disappointment.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.880]   You say, but this is sheer pessimism.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.880]   I'm going out to make the world a better place.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.640]   I'm going to start agitating and I'm going to put an end to war.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.680]   My dear friend, people have tried that before.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.080]   They have tried everything.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:26.360]   The whole story of civilization is the story of the effort of men to put his world right.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.720]   Man's always been seeking for that elusive happiness that he never finds.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.800]   He can't find peace.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.160]   Let's not despise the great record of history and of civilization.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.160]   It's been a noble one.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.480]   It's been a wonderful one.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.680]   The striving of men, the intellect, the thought, the endeavor, all he's tried to do, politically
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   and in every other respect.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.280]   But where has it brought us?
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.720]   Isn't it about time that we drew up a balance sheet?
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.080]   Why does it always end in failure?
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.160]   Why have all the great civilizations always come to nothing?
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.200]   Why is it that even non-Christian scientists are ready at the present time to predict that
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.800]   this is probably the last period in the history of the world and civilization?
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   What's gone wrong?
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.640]   Why do all our efforts come to nothing?
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.560]   What is this fatal something that dogs all the highest endeavors of men and brings them
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.840]   to a final futility?
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.840]   What is it?
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.960]   Doesn't it, at any rate, tell us this, that it doesn't lie in man himself to save himself?
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.680]   He's done his utmost.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   And it's been a magnificent failure.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.520]   But it's a failure.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.480]   It isn't in men that breathes to do it.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.440]   Neither is it in your so-called great world religions.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.680]   Every one of them is hopeless.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.360]   You study them for yourself.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   They're all hopeless.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.320]   The only hope they give you is to die out of this world and to be absorbed into some
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.200]   ultimate, some absolute in the end, some nirvana.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.920]   Or you may have to come back many times.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.560]   They're all completely hopeless.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   Why are they hopeless?
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:09.380]   Well, they're all finally hopeless because they can't deal with this central contradiction
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.560]   that is in men.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:19.480]   All men's problems arise ultimately from that which is true of him in the words of Jeremiah.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.680]   The heart of man is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.000]   Who can know it?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   A man himself can't.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.520]   He's on his own side.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.480]   He can always make himself appear better than he is.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.720]   He can criticize the other.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.960]   He defends himself on the same point.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:34.960]   Man is not honest.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.960]   He can't know himself.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.720]   He knows he's a biased witness.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   He's a fool.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.320]   Oh, the human heart is desperately wicked and deceitful.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.720]   Who can know it?
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.040]   And the answer is there is only one who knows it.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:56.160]   Thou, Lord, triest the heart and knowest the reins.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.200]   So we come back to this, you see, that in the words that are used by the great apostle,
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.440]   what a man needs is to be saved.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:12.640]   "Who hath saved us," says the apostle, "and called us with an holy calling."
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.720]   Man needs to be saved.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.360]   He'll never have peace and rest.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:25.800]   He'll never be able to say as he faces life at its worst, "Nevertheless, I am not ashamed
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:31.040]   until he's been delivered from himself, delivered from the thralldom of circumstances, delivered
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   from the world, the flesh, the devil, delivered by God, to God, for God, and finds his rest
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:45.080]   and peace in the arms of God."
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   And how does that happen?
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.400]   Well, you see, it's all here.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.280]   I know him whom I have believed.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.120]   The apostle talks about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death and
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.080]   brought life and immortality to light.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.920]   There it is.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.520]   You see, it comes back to that.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:12.360]   There is only hope for men when, realizing the truth about himself and his final impotence
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:20.800]   and incompetence, he just cries out unto the Lord, just where he is.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.880]   And the Lord will hear him, the Lord who came from heaven and lived and died and rose again.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.680]   He will hear his cry.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:33.600]   He has said, "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out."
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:40.440]   He stands and he cries to the world in its tragedy and shame and misery and failure tonight,
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:54.280]   "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.480]   He says, "I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:05.800]   And when you have had that life from him, as you face death you will be able to say
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:14.400]   with this mighty apostle, "To me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:22.280]   Because it means to be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   Man may trouble and perplex me, 'twill but drive me to thy breast.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.120]   That's it.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:38.480]   Safe, as the old hymn put it, safe in the arms of Jesus.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:45.640]   Well, I hope next Sunday night to go on to tell you in greater detail about him.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:50.960]   This is the only hope, my friends, that God hasn't abandoned the world, but God so loved
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:55:00.760]   the world, and rebellious, sinful, self-centered, mad men, God so loved the world that he gave
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:12.040]   his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.960]   life and be enabled to say whatever happens to him.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:24.880]   For this I am not ashamed, for I know him in whom I have believed, and am persuaded
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:36.520]   that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him until against that day.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.880]   Amen.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.840]   The closing hymn is hymn number 372, 372.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   372.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   372.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.840]   372.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   372.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:28.840]   372.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:58.840]   372.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:18.840]   Come unto me, ye weary, and I will give you rest.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   372.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
