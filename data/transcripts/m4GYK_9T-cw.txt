[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   I professionally handle gift cards, I touch gift cards all the time.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.840]   I never give gift cards as gifts.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.000]   The best way to use a gift card, the way I use them is as a way to save money.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   It's a way to get an additional discount on stuff you're going to buy anyway.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   So I guess that operates on the assumption that gift cards
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.120]   should cost less than the actual value of the gift card.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.760]   Yes. You should never pay a full price for a gift card,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.160]   which I think is what most people's experience is.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.280]   They go into a Walgreens because they need to get a gift for a party
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.640]   that they forgot that they were supposed to bring a gift to.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.880]   and then they pay full price for a gift card off the rack to give to someone else.
