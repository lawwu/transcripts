[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.800]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, episode number 9.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   In this episode, I'll be speaking
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   with Dr. Wesley Gray, CEO of Alpha Architect,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.800]   where he and his colleagues are breaking new ground.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.440]   And the author of three books on quantitative investing.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.360]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.400]   My name is Rick Ferry, and this is Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.160]   This episode is sponsored by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.560]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.360]   Today, we're speaking with Dr. Wesley Gray.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.800]   After serving in the United States Marine Corps,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.360]   Dr. Gray earned an MBA and a PhD in finance
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.040]   from the University of Chicago, where
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.040]   he studied under Nobel Prize winner Eugene Fama.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.400]   He then took a job in academia before starting his investment
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.320]   management company, where he is on the cutting
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.840]   edge of new insights into factor investing.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.800]   With no further ado, let's bring in Dr. Wesley Gray.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.800]   How are you today?
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.960]   I'm great, Rick.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.720]   I appreciate you bringing me on.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.880]   You very much impressed me the very first time
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.440]   I learned about you and I talked with you.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.280]   The stuff you're working on is cutting edge.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   I really believe that you are the new Jedi out there
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.320]   in the quant world.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.800]   Before we get into what you're currently doing now,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   I want to start at the beginning.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.480]   Where did you go to your undergraduate degree?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.520]   I went to undergrad at University of Pennsylvania
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.880]   at the Wharton School.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.320]   I kind of started off with the Uber finance geek undergrad.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.840]   And my first way I parlayed myself into academic research
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.320]   is I walked into this gentleman's office
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.920]   named Chris Gatesy, who now writes
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.320]   a lot of papers on the 200-year history of momentum
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.560]   or relative strength or value or what have you.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.480]   And I just said, I love this stuff.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.200]   Can you teach me how to be a professor?
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.000]   And he basically said, hey, see that shelf right there?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.880]   Grab these 10 books and read them and come back in two weeks
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   and let's talk.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   That was my initial start into geeking out and getting
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.240]   into academic research and moving along my initial path,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   which was to be a finance professor.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520]   But there was also another side to you.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.480]   You had this idea that perhaps you
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.160]   could figure out ways of outperforming the market.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.120]   Well, yeah, kind of.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.760]   Simultaneous to the sign I want to be a finance professor,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.400]   I was also trading my own money, doing a lot of investing.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.520]   I was there from '98 to 2002, and so that was obviously
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.040]   during the internet bubble.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   And so I had this exposure where I'd come off
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.280]   reading every book, everything I could get my hands on related
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.160]   to Ben Graham and Warren Buffett and the value investment
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.760]   philosophy.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.200]   Pets.com's going up 1,000% a day.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.160]   My dad's telling me to go buy the Janus Global Tech Fund.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   And I'm a value-by-nature person,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.120]   and I'm watching these markets thinking they're crazy.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   I'm obviously trading in value names, getting destroyed.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.440]   But then on the other side of my life,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'm like, hey, I just intellectually like this.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480]   And I was like, hey, I want to stay this forever.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.120]   So it was kind of a weird barbell in the sense
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.920]   that I was sitting there trading stocks,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.600]   and then on the other hand, I was reading stochastic calculus
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   books, just trying to get baseline, essentially
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.360]   to be a research assistant for Gatesy.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.400]   And so what happened is I kept doing all the investment stuff,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   kept doing my stock picking.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.040]   And then I started--
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.480]   essentially, I became, for the Wharton Finance Department,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   the--
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.160]   I don't want to use the-- the computer monkey.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.360]   I was like the data monkey.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   So if someone needed to have something coded up in MATLAB,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.280]   that was my job.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.040]   So I kind of became like a little mini workhorse
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.560]   for the department.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.920]   So fast forward a couple of years,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.560]   and I was saying, all these guys are also, by the way,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.200]   Chicago PhDs, because for whatever reason,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.720]   Chicago tends to feed the Wharton faculty.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   And Chris Gatesy's like, hey, you're
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   going to apply to Chicago.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.520]   And that's it.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   I was like, well, aren't there other schools?
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.120]   Should I consider other PhD programs?
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.080]   They're like, no, you've got to go to Chicago.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.440]   They're like, we'll get you in.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.240]   And I'm like, OK, how does that work?
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.440]   They're like, hey, take all your tests and do all your stuff,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.120]   and we'll write your recommendations letters.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.880]   And so sure enough, I applied to the University of Chicago PhD
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.840]   program just straight out of undergrad,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.520]   which is also not normal, because typically, you
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   go get a master's or what have you.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.520]   But I had a lot of kind of close holds in the department
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   that were writing letters for me.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.760]   And PhD programs, they only accept a handful of people
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.880]   every year, so it's a much more kind of one-off deal.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.440]   It's not like applying to an MBA program.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.360]   Long story short, I got in.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.560]   I was like, wow, I guess I'm going to actually do this.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   Since you entered the program in 2002,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.760]   the Chicago school at the time--
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.000]   and it still is to a certain extent--
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480]   it's just, we're going to take you in,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.000]   and we're just going to beat you up.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.480]   You are going to get destroyed in problem sets, workload,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.200]   and let's just see if you survive.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.160]   And so the first two years are just--
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.000]   literally, I was studying like 15 hours a day,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   seven days a week, just trying to stay above water.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   Because I came in, obviously, without having
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.480]   a lot of experience or grad score or what have you.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.760]   So it was actually, say, pretty difficult, but I made it.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.560]   And so after the first two years there,
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   I don't say I was burned out, but I was 24.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.120]   I'd been slaving away doing quaint academic geek stuff
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.880]   forever.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.560]   And I just thought, hey, I need to maybe take a break
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.760]   or do something else.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.920]   So you really did do something else.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.640]   I would say that what you did was quite radical.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.880]   And of course, I'm proud of you for it.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.040]   So what I did is I decided I was going
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.640]   to join the Marine Corps, which you're an alumnus of.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   And it certainly seems radical.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.280]   But what was super interesting at the time
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.200]   is I would say a good 20% to 30% of the Chicago Finance PhD
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.080]   program were actually former military officers, a lot of them
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.800]   from Israel or Finland or what have you.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   So they were all like, oh, yeah, of course you should do that.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.000]   Whereas many people outside are like,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.400]   you must be the first time anyone's ever done that.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.600]   But what was super interesting is inside the program,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   my other fellow PhD mates were like, hey, that's pretty cool.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   And so, yeah, I went down to Professor Fama.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.560]   And at the time, Professor Thaler, which is crazy,
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.960]   I had these two Nobel Prize winners,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.680]   were actually-- it wasn't my dissertation,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.320]   but my curriculum paper advisors.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.280]   And I just had to ask them permission
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.680]   to get a four-year sabbatical.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.440]   And Professor Fama was actually super cool about it.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.320]   He's just like, oh, that's awesome.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   Proud of you.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.280]   Yeah, happy to sign.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.960]   Didn't even think twice about it.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.920]   And then your Professor Thaler, he was more curious.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.560]   He was definitely like, you're going to do what?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.040]   But eventually, I got both those gentlemen to sign off
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   and then submitted it to the PhD program coordinator
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.800]   and took a four-year sabbatical.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.400]   That's amazing that you could actually
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.720]   do that, take four years off.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.080]   Well, so you can't.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   You can take technically one year off.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.480]   And so that's the reason I had to go and have them sign off
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.440]   on this special kind of extended sabbatical,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.360]   because it was a unique circumstance where most people
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.240]   don't go on sabbatical to do service.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.800]   The PhD program director kind of agreed, like, hey,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.640]   this is a unique circumstance.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.120]   As long as you get your advisors to sign off on it,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.040]   we're cool with it.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.320]   And so I had to do a few extra hoops to jump through
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.120]   to actually make it happen.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.920]   Well, that's great.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.400]   And then you went down to Quantico
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.000]   and went through Officer Candidate School?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.400]   Yep, so then I went to OCS, which
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.600]   is Officer Candidate School, then
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.040]   went to TBS, the basic school.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.400]   And then my MOS was a ground intelligence officer.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.520]   You go through the infantry officer course.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.280]   You kind of do everything that the infantry officers do.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.400]   And then they go pick up their platoons,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.440]   whereas ground intelligence officers then go down
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.160]   to dam neck and do another six months of intelligence officer
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.960]   training.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   And then you go hit the fleet.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.280]   So it's the longest pipeline besides, you know,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.200]   Hilo and fixed wing people.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   But it's about a year and a half, almost two years,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.520]   of training pipeline.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.640]   And from there, they shipped you off to Okinawa.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   I went right to Okinawa.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.120]   And then right when I was in Okinawa,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.200]   they sent me down to one of the islands in Japan
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.560]   and did a bunch of, like, joint training missions with them.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.680]   Spent about a month there.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.840]   And then I got sent directly down to the Philippines.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.080]   And at the time, this was, I think, was that 2004, 2005,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.280]   there was a bunch of activity going on
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.400]   on this island called Holo, which
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.720]   is a bunch of Muslim extremists and what have you.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.120]   But then there was this thing called the Leyte mudslide
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.880]   disaster and a coup.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.520]   So I was in the Philippines, you know,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.880]   going crazy for a couple months there.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.560]   And then right when I got back to Okinawa,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.760]   which I was assigned there, but I rarely ever hung out there
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.240]   for, like, maybe a day or two, the colonel
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.800]   calls me in the office.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.280]   And he basically says, hey, you're going to Hawaii.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.080]   And I was like, all right, why am I going to Hawaii?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.320]   They're like, oh, you're on a MIT team, a military transition
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.240]   training team, and you're going to get deployed to Iraq.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.320]   So then I went out to Hawaii, did a big work up.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.940]   And then we deployed out.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.440]   I was on one of the training teams
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.800]   where you're in bed with Iraqis and try
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   to help them avoid shooting themselves in the foot.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.200]   In fact, you wrote an entire book about your experience
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.360]   working with the Iraqis.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.240]   The name of the book was called Embedded.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.720]   And it was a fascinating insight into what was going on.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.480]   Yeah, so I kind of went in to the service.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.020]   I didn't join the service because I
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.240]   wanted to go to war, per se.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.320]   I just wanted to do my time.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   But I was certainly under the belief when--
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.660]   I don't know if you probably remember,
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.200]   but Colin Powell showed that little powder
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   of-- that white powder and said, hey, we're all going to die.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   I kind of believed that.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.040]   I was like, all right, we need to probably do something here.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.520]   Fast forward, now I'm actually deployed,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.360]   living in an Iraqi battalion, training up these Iraqi soldiers
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.000]   to kind of take over their defense duties.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.160]   And I really got an opportunity to actually live
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.920]   with these people, eat with these people,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.680]   talk with these people, and kind of get
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   a better insight to the culture and kind of how they operate.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.080]   And that experience, honestly, just floored me.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   And I took a whole 180, where I said,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.320]   I don't know what we're doing here.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.800]   This is crazy.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Like, I was not expecting this.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.560]   These people are tribal.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.960]   They're totally different.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.480]   Like, what we're trying to achieve here
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.400]   does just not jive at all with their society.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.800]   I need to tell the story, because there's probably
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.440]   a lot of guys like me that, rah, rah, let's go to war.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.320]   And they don't realize it.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.880]   So I just got inspired.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.700]   I was like, I got to share the story.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.800]   So I had to just write a whole book, basically,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.240]   about my time being embedded with the Iraqis
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   and just trying to explain their cultural nuance
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.120]   and why what we were trying to do,
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.520]   like bring freedom and democracy to their society,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.640]   just seemed like maybe it wasn't a great idea.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.840]   That's pretty much what that book was about,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.800]   just sharing my experiences there,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.480]   which were highly enlightening to me.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.440]   And I just wanted to make sure other people got
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.260]   to at least experience it through at least my book,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.540]   even if they can't be there themselves.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.320]   I understand that you speak Arabic
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.820]   and that you taught yourself.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.420]   I did.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.580]   So I mean, I could probably converse in it
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.900]   if I got warmed up.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.140]   But yeah, so I was the intelligence officer.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.300]   And the more I read beforehand, because I
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.100]   knew we were going to war in these areas,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.780]   speaking Arabic, the actual language there
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.700]   means a heck of a lot more because it's
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.220]   associated with the religion, because it's from Allah.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.900]   So it's kind of a big deal.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.460]   So the more-- if you want to win in those sort of culture wars,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.080]   you've got to really establish bonds with the people
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.140]   you're working with.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.820]   And so learning the language, I thought, was a main effort.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   So yeah, I just put a ton of time
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.140]   up front to train extremely hard,
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.340]   both on learning how to kill people and everything,
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.780]   but also how to learn this language.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.500]   And then when I got there, I just
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   forced myself to literally embed with the people
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.660]   and not use a terp.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.380]   And then if you sit there long enough
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.940]   and get tired of using hand signals
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.860]   and not understand each other, eventually you
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.320]   can start maneuvering.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.580]   So yeah, I got to a point where I actually
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.660]   served as a terp for our team.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.340]   And we would go out on convoys.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.340]   And I would be the terp to interface
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.020]   between our team and the Iraqis.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.260]   Yes, and I definitely highly recommend,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.300]   if anyone has to do that mission ever again,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.340]   to spend way more time learning the language and a lot less
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.780]   on tactics, per se.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.020]   Because it gives you a lot more, I'd
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.980]   say, what the Iraqis call wasta, kind of karma and the ability
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.540]   to interact with them and have them actually listen to you
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.580]   if you actually know their language.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.020]   That's fascinating.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.780]   Well, you did that.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.140]   Did you stay for four years?
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.620]   Yep, did the four-year active duty.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.980]   And then after that, you went back
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   to the University of Chicago?
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.740]   Got out when it was early 2008.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.660]   And then my mind-- well, you know, being in the service,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.380]   it's just obviously way different
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.540]   than being in a PhD program at University of Chicago.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.220]   Just slightly.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.620]   I got out-- yeah, yeah, kind of like 180.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.180]   And so literally for the first three months,
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.020]   I just had to relearn everything.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.420]   Because my curriculum paper had a bunch of math in it.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.460]   And honestly, I couldn't even read my own paper.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.700]   I was like, well, I don't even know what this person's
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.780]   talking about.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.500]   But it was me.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.380]   So I just put the basics on like, hey, here,
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.460]   I got to relearn calculus and all this stuff.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.540]   And it is true that it is like riding a bike, where
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.940]   if you know how to do it, if you just get back into it,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.300]   you do quickly learn.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.940]   So yeah, reentered the program, moved back to Chicago.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.060]   And I was in much more like--
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.780]   I was in discipline mode versus a lot of my comrades
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.340]   there at the PhD program who were students,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.300]   because I'd kind of come out with a new look on life.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.380]   So I was like, I'm getting out of here in two years.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.460]   And because usually you don't get out of the PhD program
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.020]   in a collective four years.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.380]   Usually it's five, six years.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.180]   But I just didn't want to mess around.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.820]   So I spent three months relearning everything.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.460]   And then I immediately went to work on dissertation.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.900]   So yeah, because my goal was I need
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.940]   to get out of this place by 2010.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.700]   Or my wife, she's not going to be
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.980]   happy living on a ramen noodle salary for longer than that.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.340]   And who was your mentor on your dissertation?
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.900]   So I went back to my old curriculum paper advisors.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.580]   And it was Thaler and Fama were the top two.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.260]   And then another gentleman, Andrea Frazzini,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.660]   who's also famous now, but he actually left and went to AQR.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.060]   So when I came back, basically Frazzini had already
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.020]   gone to go be a millionaire over at AQR.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.780]   Thaler had gotten too famous.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.580]   So he obviously wasn't going to mess with PhD students anymore.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.460]   So really who I was left with was
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.060]   Fama, because he was the only link in the chain that
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.260]   hadn't been broken.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.300]   So I essentially went to him.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.580]   And he was kind of like my core advisor.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.540]   And then another gentleman, Stavros Panagias,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.820]   he helped me a lot because I had a theory paper as well
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.460]   as part of my dissertation.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.460]   Pietro Viranesi was another one.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.820]   So I had a handful of them.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.700]   But I'd say the most influential and obviously
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.300]   the one that had the most experience
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.180]   in empirical asset pricing work was obviously Professor Fama.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.140]   So he was kind of the one that hazed me the most,
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.220]   I would say, in the dissertation writing stage.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.540]   Your paper, if I'm not mistaken, was about active management.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:06.060]   Yeah, so being a Marine and probably a little hardheaded,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.740]   I came back.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.900]   And I'd always been, like I was telling you before,
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.180]   a stock picker, specifically a big believer in value investing
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.420]   and value investing stock picking.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   And so what I decided was I want to highlight to Professor Fama
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.260]   that active stock picking can add value,
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.740]   because this whole efficient market thing seems a little too
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.860]   crazy to me.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.260]   So you're going to tell Eugene Fama, the future Nobel
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.460]   laureate, that he was wrong.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.340]   At least that was my going in.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.260]   And so what I did is, well, how am I going to highlight this?
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.340]   Well, it turns out that there's this organization called Value
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.780]   Investors Club, where a bunch of super sophisticated stock
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.620]   pickers, a lot of them associated with hedge funds,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.020]   they would submit huge theses on basically stock pitches.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.980]   So best buys undervalued.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.100]   Here's my DCF.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.020]   Here's the 100 reasons why.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.260]   And so what I thought is like, hey, I've
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.660]   been following this club since 2000.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.060]   I'm a member of this club.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.180]   I think they add a lot of value.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.100]   They seem to have really good ideas.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.420]   I'm going to read every single one of these stock pitches,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.900]   systematically enter them into a database,
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.420]   and do the quant analysis on it to then assess, hey,
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.820]   do these people actually add value or have, quote unquote,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.940]   "alpha."
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.980]   Long story short, they do, at the margin.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.300]   And so I submitted this as part of my dissertation.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.420]   And somehow, by the grace of God,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.540]   Fama agreed with the analysis.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.860]   He had some quibbles on takeaways.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.860]   But at least at the margin, I highlighted
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.660]   that there is some segment of the market
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.900]   where active stock picking might work at the margin.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.340]   So that was a small victory for me.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.220]   How did you meet up with Jack Vogel, who you ultimately
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.100]   became partners with at Alpha Architect?
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.380]   Sure, so what happened is when I graduated from the program
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.820]   there, I went on the academic professor market.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.340]   And also, my wife was going on the academic market.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.620]   She's a PhD in history, which is a way less, I'd say,
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.020]   marketable profession than being a finance professor.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.900]   So I went out to the market.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.660]   And my wife's from Philly.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.540]   And she needed a job as a history professor.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.420]   And I ran into Drexel, who gave me what
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.860]   they call an exploding offer.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.340]   So they gave me this offer I couldn't refuse.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.100]   They gave me three days to decide on it.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.820]   They say, hey, come to Philly.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.100]   Your wife's from here.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.500]   We'll get her a job.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.220]   And we'll give you the best gig ever.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.260]   And we'll assign you a PhD student
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.220]   who will do all your dirty work.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.100]   So I was like, OK, well, sign me up.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.180]   What are you going to do?
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.820]   How often do you got to twist my arm?
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.620]   And so I entered Drexel.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.740]   And then part of my package was having a dedicated research
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.740]   assistant.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.860]   And that happened to be Jack Vogel.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.740]   So just by circumstance and a lot of great luck,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:05.340]   I just had a gentleman who was insanely smart, extremely well--
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.140]   extremely good at computer programming
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.100]   and doing all this data analysis.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.780]   And we just hit it off immediately.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:16.140]   So we've been working ever since 2010 when I took that job.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.380]   Well, the way I understood it was Jack
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.420]   had read your dissertation.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.340]   And he said, yeah, all this is great.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.500]   These people have alpha.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.100]   They're outperforming the market.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.540]   But I can replicate that using a computer.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.180]   So are they really outperforming the market?
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.460]   Can you tell me about that?
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.460]   So that was an insight that actually I
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.060]   had before I met Jack.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.540]   And kind of the takeaway from--
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.900]   well, the interesting takeaway from the dissertation
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.140]   was I cataloged all this data on these individual stock pickers.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.060]   And sure enough, they had alpha relative to Pharma, French
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.340]   models, what have you.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.660]   But essentially what they were doing for all intents
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.940]   and purposes was small cap value investing
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.800]   in a certain element of concentration
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.420]   because there's only so many ideas that they would produce.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.940]   It's not like you go buy 500 names at a time.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.460]   So there would usually be like five or six ideas a month,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.660]   sometimes 10.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.820]   So on a rolling basis, this portfolio
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.780]   would have anywhere from 50 to 100 stocks.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.980]   But essentially what they were doing from a quant perspective
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.240]   is buying smaller stocks that were super cheap, generally
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.780]   higher quality, and doing it in somewhat concentrated fashion.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.300]   And sure enough, you could also just
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   have a computer essentially do the same idea, right?
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.620]   Concentrated, small, cheap quality.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.820]   And lo and behold, it basically replicates
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.100]   what all these stock pickers were doing,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.380]   which was certainly--
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.540]   well, it was kind of disheartening because at the time
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.900]   I was still kind of believing in stock picking
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.300]   because I was still being a stock picker.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.620]   But that kind of analysis there proved to me
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.980]   why am I banging my head against the wall
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.060]   so hard to do these dissertations on these stocks
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.060]   when you can essentially replicate
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.220]   a lot of the core ideas with just using an algorithm.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.900]   And so that was really kind of the straw
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.380]   that broke the camel's back, as they
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.380]   say, that moved me much more heavy into just pure quant
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.940]   and less into thinking I was going to be Warren Buffett.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.140]   I think the proof was in the numbers.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.660]   And Jack Bogle, your research assistant,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.900]   was doing a dissertation similar to that?
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.900]   So Jack's dissertation was a little bit different.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.980]   So what he looked at is there's a huge argument
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.620]   over whether value investing, which
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.860]   in defining academic terms just means buying cheap stocks,
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   right, on book to market or price
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.340]   earnings or what have you.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.740]   He was looking into the argument,
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.140]   is this a risk-based phenomenon, or is this
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.340]   a behavioral-based phenomenon?
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.980]   Just to explain the two ideas simply,
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.980]   the risk-based hypothesis essentially
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.620]   says that the reason cheap stocks earn higher returns
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.020]   is because cheapness is a proxy for fundamental risk.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.540]   So the reason you're getting paid more on average
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.100]   is because these stocks are just fundamentally riskier.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.660]   The behavioral argument, which is
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.140]   on the other side of the coin, is like, no, it's
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.700]   not because these stocks are riskier.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.860]   It's because the market generally throws the baby out
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.980]   with the bathwater.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.980]   And that's more related to a mispricing story
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.820]   that sentiment throws these names out
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.180]   and beats them up too bad.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.460]   And so his dissertation was about,
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.340]   how do we empirically identify whether value
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.540]   is risk or mispricing?
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.500]   And the short story is that it seems like, if anything,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.140]   it's more likely mispricing versus risk that
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.340]   explains the value premium.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.980]   Obviously, this is highly debatable,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.500]   but that's what his dissertation was all about.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.060]   And after all of that, you decided
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.380]   you were going to go out and create a company together.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.860]   Well, kind of.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.300]   Actually, all this happened simultaneously,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.020]   and it's one of the crazier stories in our industry.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.380]   So right when I actually got my job,
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.660]   it actually was during the time I was on the professor markets.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.180]   At the time, I was writing a blog,
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.500]   and obviously, my dissertation was out there.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.140]   I got cold called by a very large real estate
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.500]   family in New York, and the son had
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.340]   been put in charge of essentially managing--
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.660]   it was around $4 billion of their liquid wealth.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.580]   And they were in the middle of just living through 2008,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.340]   and they were big in hedge funds,
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.500]   big in active management, and they'd got smoked.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.060]   And they're like, we're firing every one of these people.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.860]   We're going to take control of our wealth.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.540]   We're going to do this in-house.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.220]   We're going to do it with quant.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.660]   We need someone to help us.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.220]   And he had just been out there Googling around,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.860]   and somebody found me.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.220]   And he calls me up, and he's like, hey,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.940]   can you help me manage this $4 billion?
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.100]   We want to use computers.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.780]   I really like your dissertation.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.860]   How do we do this?
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.980]   So went up there, met him.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.020]   Again, this is all at the same time
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.340]   I'm sitting here thinking I'm going to be a professor.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.540]   I wasn't 100% sure if this would actually lead to anything,
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.540]   but it initially kind of led to a basic consulting
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.780]   gig where the gentleman said, help me for a couple of years.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.660]   If you guys do a great job, we'll
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.980]   cede your business on the asset management side.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.540]   Because they had just gotten out of the whole asset management
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.980]   hedge fund world, and they're like,
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.100]   we're never going to cede or do that ever again.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.940]   And then I was putting the ask on the table.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.020]   But they said, hey, give me two years.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.660]   And so essentially, I kind of helped them initially.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.900]   And then I got Jack involved immediately
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.860]   because it kept scaling up bigger and bigger.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.220]   And then so after two years, in 2012,
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.500]   they essentially ceded $20 million
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.460]   in the quantitative value strategy, which
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.700]   we have a book about.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.540]   And then very quickly, they ramped it up to 50,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.060]   and they put the other part in the international quantitative
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   value.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.580]   And this was all going on simultaneous
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.580]   to when I was being a professor as my day job.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.020]   It just-- things kept happening in the background.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.540]   So it was a very hectic time in my life, I would say.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.460]   And you were having children at the same time?
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.620]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.580]   I was up to two, and we were working on three.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.980]   And yeah, it was getting crazy.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.220]   And then essentially, what happened is after--
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.980]   I think it was around three years into it--
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.260]   this was clearly becoming a real business
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.500]   because we were managing a $50 million managed account.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.220]   We've got a huge consulting contract.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.260]   I'm also moonlighting now at this point
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.300]   basically as a finance professor.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.380]   And I was just thinking, hey, I need
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.820]   to go one way or the other here.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.660]   And so I talked to my boss, the head of the department.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.540]   I just told him, I was like, listen,
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.100]   I think I need to resign, but I don't want to screw you over
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.180]   here because recruiting for professors
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.220]   is a total nightmare, at least a one-year cycle.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.220]   So he's like, hey, put in one more year
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.180]   so we can at least recruit for your position,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.100]   and then you can go out into the sunset.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.260]   So that's essentially what happened.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.460]   After my third year being a prof,
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.180]   for all intents and purposes, I was all in on the business,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.100]   but I was still technically professing
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.220]   until they could recruit for my position
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.860]   and then basically kick me out the door.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.900]   Another interesting thing along the way
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.860]   is through this whole time period,
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.060]   it wasn't just this large family office.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.980]   For whatever reason, people like what we were putting out there.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.260]   We were just being super transparent about putting
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.460]   our research, putting our ideas.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.020]   So a bunch of random rich people would call us up and say,
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.260]   how do I do this?
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.140]   And we'd say, well, we have a managed account.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.380]   That's how you could do it.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.100]   And so we kept building the business up.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.020]   We would do tax-as-harvesting to try to minimize tax impact
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.660]   because everyone we were dealing with, it was taxable money.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.220]   And another thing happened along this way.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.820]   Another couple hundred million gentlemen out in the Midwest,
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.500]   we were working for them as well, and he had a tax problem.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.020]   And it was one of these situations
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.860]   where he had a low-basis stock that
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.540]   was going to get bought out by a large conglomerate for cash.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.380]   And he was very afraid that he was
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.580]   going to have to incur a huge capital gain event.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.700]   So he says, go figure this out.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.460]   And this is like one of these impossible things where like,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.340]   hey, go figure out how to not pay tax.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.500]   But if the rich guy says, jump, I say, how high?
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.740]   And so that's what I did.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   I went on this mission.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.980]   How am I going to deal with this problem?
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.940]   And I ran into a gal at a bank and structured product.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.220]   And this is not something you could really do anymore.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.580]   But it was all related to the ETF structure.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.860]   And I started to learn about how the ETF structure essentially
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.900]   allows assets to come in at mark-to-market basis.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.460]   The ETF can then dump any asset out,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.780]   even if it has low basis, onto a market maker
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.860]   with no tax liability.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.940]   And it's essentially kind of a laundromat for capital gains
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.260]   liabilities.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.100]   And a light went off in my head, like, holy cow,
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.540]   if I'm doing strategies that involve trading and turning
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.800]   over, and taxes are essentially Uncle Sam's 50% performance
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.540]   fee, this seems like a good idea.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.060]   So long story short, in around 2014,
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.660]   we decided we're going to get into this ETF business
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.680]   because we thought it was a better structure to deliver
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.140]   these concentrated factor portfolios than doing them
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.940]   in SMA with tax-loss harvesting.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.780]   Just out of curiosity, all that work
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:02.140]   you did on the ETF structure of how it--
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.640]   Yep.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.180]   With the creation of the redemption,
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.180]   how you can push out any unrealized gains
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.240]   onto the authorized participants.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.860]   You had that one client in the Midwest
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.440]   who had this big capital gain problem,
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.560]   and then you had this ETF over here.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.740]   I've always wondered, is there any kind of a structured
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.380]   product, or can there be a structured product where
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.700]   you could take people who have these stocks out there
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.620]   and put them all together, and bring it in,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.540]   and just issue them shares of an ETF,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.780]   and then take the stock then that they put in kind
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.700]   into the ETF, and then give it to an authorized participant
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.500]   to get rid of.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.400]   And now their cost basis is in the ETF.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.780]   It's diversified.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.380]   Is that possible?
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.180]   Yes.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.140]   Yes and no.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.340]   The long story short is in the old days, yes.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.980]   But what happened is all the big banks
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.300]   got smoked out on a bunch of tax things a few years ago,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.260]   and they just cut off anything that could even
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.140]   be perceived as being on the edge
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.220]   because they didn't want to make Treasury angry.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   So my understanding from the inside baseball
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.060]   of talking to people that deal in this world
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.020]   is in the old days, they would actually
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.220]   do stuff like that for super ultra high net worth clients
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.460]   and where they control the custody and clearing pipes.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.060]   But my understanding is nowadays, that doesn't go on.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.540]   But I certainly feel like an enterprising entrepreneur that
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.420]   had the time and energy to try to figure that out,
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.900]   it could be possible.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.380]   We've looked into it from like 50 different angles
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.020]   and haven't been able to figure it out.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.660]   But yeah, there's certainly--
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.700]   there's something there.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.620]   I just haven't solved it.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.260]   I believe there's something there too.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.340]   I believe that this thing called direct indexing where you can--
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.780]   --you buy 250 or 300 stocks, and then you individually
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.980]   sell off the ones that are at a loss and do a tax swap.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.520]   And at the end, when that's all played out four or five years
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.400]   down the road, when there is no really longer any ability
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.300]   to do a lot of tax swapping, you've
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.500]   got this portfolio of 200, 300 stocks
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.860]   that have a low cost basis.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.780]   But that looks an awful lot like an index.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.420]   So if you could just take that and just turn that
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.660]   into an ETF provider and get shares of a more diversified
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.260]   ETF where the cost basis of the ETF
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.340]   is the cost basis of all your stocks in aggregate,
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.640]   but it's a lot more easy to manage one security than 400.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.960]   I agree 100%.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.240]   And I get in fights all the time with people arguing over,
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.080]   do you do the ETF structure or do you do the tax loss
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.880]   harvesting structures?
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.160]   And I still believe there's a marginal benefit.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.400]   Even if you're doing pure passives,
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.660]   like say, for example, the parametric solution like S&P
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.720]   with tax loss harvesting or just go buy the Vanguard Fund,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   I still believe that the Vanguard Fund is better
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   because a lot of people also forget, and to your point,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.440]   that eventually you get basis and everything.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.720]   But the index changes.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.080]   Like firms get bought out for cash.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.760]   Guess what?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.700]   You can deal with that problem in an ETF structure.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.800]   You can't if you are in Social Security.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.880]   Like if you have low basis and Joe Blow
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.560]   wants to buy the company out for cash,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.240]   you're going to eat tax liability.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.840]   That's easy to cleanse in an ETF.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.460]   And then there's the fee differential.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.800]   Those tax loss harvesting solutions are 20, 30, 40 bps.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.640]   An S&P 500 ETF is basically zero.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.960]   So if you annuitize that cost differential
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.600]   over the life of the investment, the lump sum of that's maybe 2%,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.280]   3% of your wealth.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.680]   Probably not.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.880]   Is that the value of the tax loss shield you're going to get?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.640]   I don't think so.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.740]   So I think tax loss harvesting and direct indexing
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:04.240]   is total hype overblown versus just buying the passive index
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.080]   through an ETF structure for zero.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.480]   That seems like a better long-term solution to me.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.760]   But reasonable people can disagree.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.920]   Let's move on a little bit.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.080]   So all of a sudden, you decide you're
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.960]   going to launch Alpha Architect.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.080]   And you open up the world headquarters,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.680]   which I've been to several times now.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.500]   So the original world headquarters
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.440]   was in a little house I had in New Jersey.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.320]   But that was five minutes from my mother-in-law.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.120]   So both my wife and I agreed that, hey, we should probably
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.560]   move a little bit further away.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.120]   So we moved over here to the Pennsylvania side.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.480]   And I'd spent a year doing a commute from Baltimore
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.940]   to Philly when I was first year as a professor there,
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.720]   because we still had a place down there.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.440]   And I came out of the service.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   I'd swore off commuting, because I actually
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.280]   wanted to hang out with my kids.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.880]   I like exercising.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.480]   So I said, you know what?
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.080]   I'm going to set up a business in my house.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.160]   And if people don't like it, that's fine.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.640]   But it's good for my mental, physical health.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.120]   It's going to make me operate more efficiently.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.920]   Why not?
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.720]   And so we bought this place out in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.600]   It's kind of a compound of sorts.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.720]   And now it's Alpha Architect Global Headquarters.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.400]   But yeah, essentially, we just built an office
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.240]   inside this residence, got it zoned and everything.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.320]   And we start off with, obviously, no AUM hardly at all.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.800]   And now we have almost a billion.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.640]   But it functionally achieves the goal.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.120]   It keeps our costs down low.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.200]   And it keeps commuting time down.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.840]   So we're kind of stuck with it.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.760]   So it's a bit awkward.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.640]   But in the world of 0% management fees,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.040]   you've got to do weird things sometimes.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.280]   And I understand some interesting artifacts
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.040]   went along with that house.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.000]   So we got this place from a big game hunter, who
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   was basically had-- it was a tragic situation.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.640]   He had pancreatic cancer.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.800]   And he was basically going to die in three months.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.600]   So it was kind of a liquidation opportunity of some sort,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.760]   both the house and our friends we have.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.360]   He was, like I said, a big game hunter.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.120]   So we acquired a grizzly bear, a leopard,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.400]   and a bunch of other really cool taxidermy mounts.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.000]   And one of which we keep in the office, the grizzly bear,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.880]   because we like to say that we try to kill bear markets.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   And we have evidence of it by having our grizzly bear here.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.640]   So it's definitely a unique experience
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.080]   visiting Alpha Architect Headquarters.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   It was for me, because when I first time I went to visit you,
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.840]   I'm driving down this residential street,
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.720]   and I'm saying, this can't be it.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:51.380]   We've had many of very, very wealthy people
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.200]   and a lot of famous folks roll through here
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.680]   with that exact same expression.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.360]   What in the world did this guy talk me into?
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.840]   Why am I hanging out in a residence
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.600]   in the suburbs of Philadelphia?
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.400]   Is this person crazy or what?
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.960]   So things have gone well.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.600]   You've launched several ETFs.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:18.160]   And the way in which you do ETF and factor investing,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.960]   I find it to be kind of the right way of doing it.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.280]   It's almost like the next generation of factor investing,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.160]   because it's so deep and so concentrated
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:35.040]   that if you want to do factor investing, that it seems to me
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.440]   you should be paying for as much exposure
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.360]   to these factors in a concentrated form
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.640]   as you can get.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.920]   So it appealed to me right away when I found out
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.400]   how you were doing it.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.760]   So essentially, the genesis of this idea
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.560]   is when we were working for the family office,
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.920]   they were going to do the typical thing, where they're
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.200]   like, let's go buy our cheap beta,
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.440]   but then we need to figure out how to replicate
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.000]   a lot of these different exposures
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.680]   that we used to get from these hedge fund people.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.720]   And hedge funds obviously aren't doing cheap beta stuff.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.520]   They're usually doing concentrated bets
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.880]   and stock picking, but what's essentially
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.080]   is factors like small value quality.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.960]   But they're doing it a much more focused way.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.160]   So we naturally thought, well, if we
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.400]   want to replicate these more unique exposures out there,
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.760]   we need to replicate them how they need to be replicated.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.080]   And that means we're going to do maybe factors,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.960]   but we're not going to hold 500 securities
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.760]   and focus so much on how close this tracks the index.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   We're going to do 50 stock portfolios
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.400]   and just tell people up front that this is not a closet
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.240]   index with a little tilt to the value factor.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.920]   This is pure value, where we're literally
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.080]   buying the cheapest 40 or 50 securities
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.960]   on a different metric.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.440]   We use enterprise multiples, but keep it simple, like PE ratio.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.680]   So yeah, and that's just what we did.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.240]   And we just told people up front of the downside, which
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.080]   is, of course, the tracking error
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.400]   and the relative performance that this stuff can bounce
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   around, both good and bad, over long time periods.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.160]   And you should just be prepared for that.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.880]   It's not the Vanguard fund.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.800]   And we just wanted to deliver it transparently, affordably,
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.040]   and be very up front about the potential pain associated
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.880]   with this style of investing.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.800]   And I think that's all very interesting.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.200]   Let's say that you want to have a slice of your portfolio
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.300]   to additional risk factors.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.420]   And the reason I use additional risk factors
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.240]   is because I actually interviewed Gene Fama one time.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.360]   And I said, if beta is a factor, so what
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.640]   do you call these other things?
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.560]   Do you call them smart beta?
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.000]   Do you call them--
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.880]   what do you call them?
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.040]   And his answer was, they are additional risk factors.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.600]   So they are additional betas.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.680]   I said, OK, so let's say you wanted exposure
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.280]   to something other than beta.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.240]   I guess you could do it by going long short, correct?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.000]   But that would be expensive in many ways.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.800]   So here you're going long only, but you're
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.280]   doing it very concentrated, and you're keeping the cost down.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.700]   Yes, that's right.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.960]   So you got it.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.320]   So the concept, to Professor Fama's point,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.360]   and our portfolios are constructed
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.600]   in a way that is much more akin to how academics
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   form portfolios.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.400]   And that's what all the evidence shows.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.120]   Look how great they are.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.320]   The idea is, we're not going to go long short, to your point,
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   because it's much more expensive to run, operate, and just
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.120]   access those exposures.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.160]   And so we're going to stick on the long side,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.180]   but it's not going to be broad market beta exposure.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.300]   It's going to be some beta, obviously,
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.860]   because it's long only.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.980]   But we're going to focus as much as we
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.340]   can on capturing the value risk premia or the momentum risk
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.300]   premia.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.620]   And again, it's very important for us
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.260]   to communicate this element that this is a risk premia,
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.740]   and this is very different.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.380]   Because frankly, the biggest issue
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.020]   with doing different risk is that they're
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.180]   different than what a lot of people
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   see on the news channel, like on the S&P 500.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.680]   And if they're not mentally prepared for that,
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.400]   they're oftentimes going to be in at the wrong time,
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.020]   out at the wrong time, and ruin the whole reason
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.920]   for holding additional risk premia, which
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.180]   is to help your long, long-term performance
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.700]   and to diversify away from just owning generic beta.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.380]   You and I went back and forth on Twitter a little bit about,
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.900]   what does the word "long-term holding" mean?
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.140]   How long is long?
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.100]   And I think I said, a lifetime.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.020]   And you said, no, it's only 20 years.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.860]   And I said, OK, we'll compromise at 25 years.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.380]   But this idea of holding these factors for a long, long time
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.860]   is really critical to the success of an investor.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.700]   Yeah, the advice from Bogle is actually timeless,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.060]   and it applies everywhere.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.180]   Like, when he talks about holding equity,
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.380]   he doesn't suggest you should go buy the S&P 500 fund, or VT,
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.380]   or VTI, and just trade it every year.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.380]   He's like, no, this is basically your permanent holding,
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.380]   because you want to capture the equity risk premia.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.540]   Well, same thing here.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.500]   We're trying to capture some specific factor risk premia.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.180]   And the same advice applies.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.180]   You're not going to capture it by trying to time it,
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.860]   day trade it, bounce around all over the place.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.980]   You've got to hold the thing and actually earn the associated
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.100]   risk premia with it, which means you
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.100]   need to look at it more as a long-term strategic holding
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.700]   and not as a kind of a short-term trading vehicle,
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.900]   because that's not what it's really designed for.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.700]   So let's get down to the nitty-gritty then,
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.820]   the bottom line on all this.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.340]   It's going to cost me more money to go
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.940]   after those additional betas, because I have to pay a fee
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.540]   every year.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.700]   That's higher than the basically beta is free now.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:31.300]   So anything other than beta, which is now free out there,
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.180]   I'm going to decide to add additional betas
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.900]   or additional factors to my portfolio using your funds.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.740]   But your funds are not free.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.780]   Your funds have cost.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.460]   So number one, I have to get over
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.220]   that hurdle rate of the cost.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.260]   And there's this thing out there called--
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.500]   where we talk about it as an alpha decay or a premium
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.540]   decay that's going on.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.620]   As more and more people are doing what you're doing,
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:04.580]   there seems to be a decay going on as to the expected return
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.540]   from these additional factors.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.940]   Can you see that?
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.460]   Have you measured it?
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:16.060]   Are your funds going to produce--
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.720]   because I have to take money out of beta
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.460]   to put it into the additional factors.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.020]   It's long only, so I'm taking a slice of my total market index
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:25.540]   fund.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.820]   And I'm going to allocate it to your fund.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.340]   And I'm going to pay you a higher fee.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.500]   And I need to at least get beta, which I know
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.620]   I'm going to get in the market.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.820]   I've got to get above and beyond that.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.580]   Is it worth it?
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.020]   So yes, there's a lot of questions in there.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.580]   And it's all about cost and benefit.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:53.020]   So in general, when you look at any of these factors,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.940]   the cheaper you can get them, the better.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.140]   And a lot of times, the price is going
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.460]   to be associated with the scarcity of said factor.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:08.300]   If something has massive insane capacity, well, at the margin,
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.620]   that's something that Vanguard can deliver at scale.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.780]   An example of a factor like that might
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.620]   be market beta, right?
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.580]   That's obviously something that has
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.780]   trillions of dollars of capacity.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.700]   You can jam tons of money into it.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.460]   Not infinite amount of money, by the way.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.420]   But in general, that would make sense.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.860]   But then there's other sort of strategies
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.340]   where if you're actually going to do the actual factor,
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.300]   like for example, like what we do,
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.220]   40 stocks, mid cap, a lot of times small cap weight,
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.820]   you just can't jam a trillion dollars into that strategy.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.500]   So there's going to be a natural limit on capacity, which
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.460]   means you can't just scale it to infinity, which
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.420]   means the cost can't be free because you've
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.300]   got to pay the fixed costs and the bills
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.740]   and the operational things for running this damn thing, right?
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.580]   So that's just kind of the economics
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.500]   of general capturing any exposure that
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.380]   doesn't have infinite scale.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.620]   The second question relates to, well,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.380]   what do these premiums actually deliver?
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.100]   So for example, value, let's say.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.500]   And you could do value investing, just generic.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.580]   Let's just call it low PE investing.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.340]   You could do it one of two ways.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.140]   We'll just make up.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.700]   One way is you could go buy a portfolio of, say,
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.060]   40 stocks that have low PE.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.660]   Another way is you could go and weight.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.700]   You could go take the S&P 500 stocks
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.460]   and kind of tilt more weight towards the low PE,
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.620]   less weight to the high PE.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.900]   But on net, you're basically not really doing much.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.060]   You're kind of tilting one way or the other.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.100]   So clearly, the potential value add
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.100]   from the so-called value factor is
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.620]   going to be a lot higher in the concentrated one
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.220]   than in the diluted one.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.140]   So that's one element, like how is the thing constructed.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.020]   But then the other important element is,
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.340]   is this premium going to pay off in the first place?
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.100]   Because let's just say value just doesn't work at all.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.140]   Well, then if I have it in a concentrated format
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.260]   or have it in a diluted format, it's
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.940]   not going to do anything for me.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.340]   And that gets back to the question of, well, why does
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.060]   a factor pay off in the first place?
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.740]   And because it's an open secret, and because a lot of people
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.180]   know about it, and because a lot of people
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:28.220]   are perceived to be doing it, will that make it decay?
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.380]   Well, we've got to step back and say,
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.580]   why did they pay off in historical sense?
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:40.300]   Well, value generally paid off, because to Fama's point,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.060]   it's riskier.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.980]   So unless you were to believe that risk preferences have
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.900]   changed, then one would probably want
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.580]   to believe that exposure to the value factor
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.980]   will probably pay off at some point in the future.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.380]   Clearly, it hasn't paid off very well in the last 5 or 10 years.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.380]   But just like generic market beta
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.740]   doesn't pay off all the time, it's
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.260]   had 10, 20 year droughts as well,
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.500]   there's a reason to believe from economic perspective
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:14.060]   that value will pay off, just because a lot of times
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.900]   it's fundamentally riskier.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.820]   And then the second point is that if someone
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.180]   is going to do value, and you believe even
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.660]   in the mispricing component of value,
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.300]   like people throw the baby out the bathwater,
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   there's this aspect of what they call career risk.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.420]   So just because everyone knows about something
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.740]   doesn't mean they may go and do it,
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.380]   because if you go out and buy concentrated portfolios
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.180]   of value stocks, like right now, it's
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.140]   very likely that you have a high probability of getting fired,
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.260]   because these things can bounce all over the place.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.540]   You're going to get destroyed by the S&P 500 sometimes,
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.100]   and people think you're an idiot,
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.180]   and you get booted out of the job.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.980]   So this creates its own what we call career risk premium.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.140]   So to the extent that a lot of people
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.540]   are quote, unquote, "doing these things,"
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:10.100]   but these strategies earn premiums for a reason,
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.140]   i.e., they're risky, and they stink to do,
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.460]   one would expect that over the long haul,
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.540]   they're probably going to earn some premium.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.180]   I don't know what that will be.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.940]   Historically, like a concentrated value portfolio,
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:30.340]   like what we're doing, maybe 3% to 4%
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.380]   over a generic index, which is going
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.620]   to be being sourced from being smaller, being cheaper,
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.700]   for the most part.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.500]   Let's say that cuts in half to 2%,
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.300]   because at the margin, it gets more efficient.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.940]   So you may earn this 2% premium, but this is not
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.220]   like an arbitrage.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.340]   This means you're going to deal with probably more risk,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.700]   probably more vol, probably-- well,
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:01.220]   definitely way more pain in English in a relative sense
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.060]   to common benchmarks.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.940]   So you're probably going to earn this return.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.940]   But then the question is, well, how much does it
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.580]   cost me to access this 2% premium?
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:16.660]   Well, if it costs me 200 bps, that's probably a bad idea.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.780]   If it costs me zero, that'd be a great idea.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.580]   And then there's somewhere in between.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.060]   So what we do is, on our stuff, for the domestics,
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.820]   we charge 49 basis points, so just
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.700]   under 50 bps, which is obviously way more expensive than zero.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.300]   I wouldn't call it outrageous, but the idea
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.340]   is the bet on our stuff would be, hey, over the next 20
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:47.860]   years, do I believe that the excess return associated
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.140]   with the factor exposures that I'm getting here
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.300]   are in excess of 49 basis points?
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.900]   If not, then why would I do this?
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.220]   If so, OK, I might want to do this.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.420]   But then the second question would be, well,
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.860]   can someone else deliver it even cheaper?
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   Because maybe Vanguard's got some concentrated value factor
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.980]   fund for 30 bps, right?
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.580]   And the process is very similar, and I like it.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.220]   Well, OK, I think I project it's worth 1% over the long haul,
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.500]   or 2%.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.100]   It only cost me 30 bps.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.540]   Here, I'll go do that one, right?
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.660]   So it comes down to the trade-off between,
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.220]   what do you expect this premium to pay off over the long haul?
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.860]   What do I got to pay for it?
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.540]   And obviously, you want to pay less and earn more
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.540]   as best you can, which is what I argue
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.860]   a lot of these people that do factor investing
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.060]   are doing today.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.900]   They're not buying and holding our fund for 20 years.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.580]   They're day trading the iShares factor funds.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.580]   That's not arbitraging factor premiums.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.620]   That's, in the end, probably contributing
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.740]   to make them even higher in the future.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.140]   But that's a different debate.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:03.620]   Speed-dating factor funds rather than marrying one.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.940]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.260]   The only way you can pull premium out of the market
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.780]   is you need to have massive amounts of permanent capital
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.620]   sticking in something, because it's kind of taking supply
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.660]   off the market.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.340]   But if all you've got is more day traders throwing money
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.340]   around, sloshing around in factors,
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.060]   that's not arbitraging away the factor.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.140]   That's just money sloshing around,
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.940]   and it's adding volatility to the factor.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:35.140]   But unless that money is like all mini Warren Buffetts holding
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.660]   for 20 years through thick and thin,
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.620]   it's not going to depress the risk premium associated
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.380]   with them, or it would be very unlikely to do so.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.340]   And I frankly don't see that sort of mentality
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.180]   amongst factor investors in the marketplace.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.380]   Nor do I see that as an incentive for product
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.820]   manufacturers, because they're in the business of activity.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.060]   So the more I can get you to like day trade them,
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.180]   do this, that, and the other thing,
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.860]   that's good for the business out there.
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.140]   So I think people have an incentive
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.100]   to promote activity in factors.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.620]   And you've written a lot about this.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.740]   You've got three books out there, numerous papers.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.860]   The books are Quantitative Value, Quantitative Momentum,
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:24.460]   and then DIY, Do-It-Yourself Financial Advisor.
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.660]   I've read the book, and it's not as easy as--
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.460]   I think you make it out to be in that book,
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.860]   how you can do all of this as a do-it-yourself investor.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.060]   But--
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:38.100]   Well, yeah, I would say it's just like on BogoHeads.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.820]   You can go review the start here.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.220]   Here's how it's done.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.300]   And yeah, you can read it, and there's the cookbook.
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.580]   But at the right price, sometimes people will still
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.020]   be like, you know what?
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.940]   Thanks, I really appreciate the transparency.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.440]   I understand what you're going to do,
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.580]   but I have better uses for my time.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.020]   I'd rather pay you to do this for me.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.140]   But there are people that definitely are DIY,
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.060]   but there's certainly a lot of people,
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:06.940]   like my grandma, for example, where she's probably not
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.540]   well-suited to DIY, even if she read the book
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.180]   and thought it was cool because her grandson wrote it.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.900]   It's a bit of a misnomer on the title.
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   We're coming up on the end of our time.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.820]   I'd just like to switch gears here for one last second.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.340]   Could you talk about your March for the Fallen
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.700]   and what that's all about?
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:29.220]   Yeah, so March for the Fallen is a 28-mile march
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.060]   held at the Pennsylvania National Guard training unit.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:37.500]   And the idea here is you're out there representing
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.820]   on behalf of those who lost loved ones in the military.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.260]   So we're supporting Gold Star families and people
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.100]   who have lost people in war.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.260]   And it's not a charity in the sense that you give money.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.740]   It's a charity in the sense that people
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.020]   that have lost their loved ones like
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.180]   to know that other people are remembering and honoring
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:58.940]   the fallen.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.860]   So that's what you do.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.260]   You're out there in your charities
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.100]   counting your blood, sweat, and tears
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:08.100]   to represent and let them know that we still appreciate
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.220]   sacrifices they gave as a family.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.460]   And so you go out there and hang out.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.820]   And it's a great cause.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.300]   And you meet a lot of great people.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.220]   And I really enjoy promoting it and trying
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.500]   to encourage as many folks as possible to come out.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.140]   And if somebody was interested in joining your group,
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.460]   you've got a pretty large group that you've put together.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.860]   Yep, so you've got-- so last year we had around 150.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.340]   This year, I imagine, we'll have probably 200 plus.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.140]   All you've got to do if you want to be on notifications,
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.460]   obviously, is reach out direct.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:44.140]   Or just if you go to alpharchitect.com/mftf,
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:48.100]   there's a whole website about training plans, nutrition,
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.380]   how to sign up, and all these sort of other things.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.820]   And all you've got to do is just show up.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.220]   We take care of lodging and chow.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.500]   And I think it's like $35 you've got
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.300]   to pay to the National Guard.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.340]   So it's very low cost, super efficient, great cause.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.220]   You meet a bunch of great people.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.580]   And I think everyone should at least do it
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.180]   one time in their life.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:10.780]   Thank you, Wes.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.340]   It's been a great conversation.
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.940]   I really appreciate you joining us here
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.880]   on Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.380]   You got it.
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.140]   It's been an honor.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.620]   And keep doing what you guys do over at Bogleheads.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.340]   I love the education and love the effort for DIY investors
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.300]   out there.
