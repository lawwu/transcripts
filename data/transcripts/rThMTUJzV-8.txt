[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   - Pastor John, here's a heavy email we received
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.960]   from a woman who prefers that her name not be used online.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.320]   Dear Pastor John, my brother-in-law recently passed away
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.600]   at age 32 in a tragic accident.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.440]   We stood by his bedside for two months,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.680]   hopeful that he would recover,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.720]   but now recognize that God's will
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720]   was to take him home to heaven.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.040]   We rejoice that he was in Christ
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.920]   and can now see him face to face.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.640]   That is awesome.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.720]   Yet there is so much sorrow left behind.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.880]   The Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes chapter three
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.760]   that there are appropriate times for different seasons.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.160]   Many days, my husband and I feel a struggle
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.880]   to get out of bed.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.320]   We struggle to enjoy blessings
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.880]   like the joys our baby boy brings
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.600]   because they remind us of our dear brother
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.800]   that we are deeply grieving.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.320]   What encouragement does the Bible give
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.800]   for those who are mourning?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160]   How do we lift each other up during these dark days?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.880]   And how do we mourn the death of a loved one
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.080]   in a God-honoring way?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.400]   Your podcasts are such a blessing to our family,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.320]   especially during this season.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160]   - Well, thank you very much.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.840]   That's encouraging.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   I love the way she put two questions back to back
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.600]   that in a sense answer each other.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.120]   She said, "What encouragement does the Bible give
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.200]   "for those who are mourning?"
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   That was one question.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.400]   And then she said, "How do we lift each other up
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.000]   "during this dark time?"
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.720]   And the first question is the answer to the second question.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.880]   In other words, if we go to the Scriptures
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.000]   and find its encouragements,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.480]   that's how we lift each other up.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   They speak God's word to each other.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.120]   So let me do that.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.400]   Let me feed into them
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   maybe five precious lessons I've learned from Scripture
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   walking through many sorrows and losses.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.720]   One, don't add to your burden
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.120]   by thinking grief is foreign
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   to the heart of God's children.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.560]   They know this, but it might be good to hear it.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   1 Thessalonians 4.13,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   about those who are asleep.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.320]   That is this brother-in-law who died.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   That you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   So he doesn't say that you may not grieve,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   but that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.560]   Christian grieving is real and it is right.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.840]   So let that not be an added burden
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.920]   that they are walking through a season
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.320]   of real painful grief.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880]   Number two, eat the fruit of sorrow,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.440]   even if it is bitter,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   because this fruit that you can only eat now
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.520]   has nutrients in it that you can't get any other way.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   And I know this is maybe a little hard to hear,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.360]   but this is so real and so needed.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Martin Luther said that God teaches us deep things
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.800]   about himself, not only, and then he used two Latin words,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.920]   not only by oratio, which means prayer,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.600]   and meditatio, which means meditation on the scriptures,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.280]   but also, this was his discovery,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   God teaches us deep things about himself also by tentatio,
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.760]   which is translated trial, testing, affliction.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   And the text that he cited was Psalm 119, 67, and 71,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.200]   which say, "Before I was afflicted, I went astray,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.000]   "but now I keep your word.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.660]   "It is good for me that I was afflicted,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.880]   "that I might learn your statutes."
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   There are nutrients that we draw out of seasons
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.200]   of suffering that are strengthening to the bones
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   of our faith and sweetening to the marrow of our faith
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   like we can't get any other way.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.260]   So eat 'em, go ahead, eat them.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.600]   As long as God keeps you in that season,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.520]   don't waste it by wishing and wishing,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.920]   wishing you'd be out of it.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.480]   Go ahead and eat the fruit that grows on that tree alone.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   Number three, savor the special,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.360]   promised nearness of the Lord.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   Psalm 34, 18, "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.320]   "and saves the crushed in spirit."
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   There is a unique and special promised nearness
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.920]   that you will enjoy.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.300]   Yes, that is a tearful, painful, true word.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.560]   You will enjoy that you will not have
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.720]   once the sun comes out again.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.500]   I know it, I've walked through this.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.440]   Two or three major, major losses in my life,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   and I wouldn't trade them for anything
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   if I just focus on the sweetness of how God drew near.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.560]   So that's number three.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   Number four, believe that he will heal the wounds
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.320]   of loss, you could call them an amputation,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.700]   without desecrating the preciousness of the memory.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.420]   I think sometimes we're so afraid
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.260]   that if this gets healed too quickly,
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.540]   it's gonna be dishonoring to my lost loved one
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.500]   because I'll just be going about my business like usual
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.380]   and it'll look like he doesn't matter.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.980]   I think we all feel that.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.780]   And yet Psalm 147.3 says,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.780]   "He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds."
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.960]   So you don't need to rush it.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.520]   And when it comes, when the healing comes,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   it won't be in any way a diminishing of the preciousness
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.440]   of the one who was taken.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.640]   Number five, this is the last one.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   Wait for God's timing of healing and restoration.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.460]   Psalm 30 verse five, "His anger is but for a moment
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.680]   and his favor is for a lifetime.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.180]   Weeping may tarry for the night, joy comes with the morning."
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.140]   Now I don't think the point of that is about the clock,
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.820]   like sadness at dusk, joy at dawn every day.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.900]   That's not the point of that statement.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.100]   The point is God does not leave his children
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.420]   indefinitely in the depths of sorrow.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.420]   Joy comes eventually when dawn comes
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.580]   and it comes in God's timing.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580]   The older you get, the more you know that terrible things
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.200]   don't have the same horrible gut punch as time goes by.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.340]   In the moment of loss, get that phone call,
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.240]   that utter disappointment, that painful email,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.680]   a dream is shattered, a massive disappointment,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.840]   something you thought would never happen.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.580]   And you feel in those first hours,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.600]   there's no way I can live with this.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.580]   And God's timing is very mysterious in its effects
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.500]   because the next day it's a little different
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.860]   and the next day it's a little different.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.620]   A week later, it's a little different.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.780]   Everybody moves at different paces,
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.420]   but God uses time and grace
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   to take away the sense of impossibility of life.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.060]   Psalm 40, verse one, "I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.200]   "He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.740]   "He drew me up from the pit of destruction,
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.080]   "out of the miry bog.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.900]   "He set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.340]   "He put a new song in my mouth,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.060]   "a song of praise to our God.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.660]   "Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.160]   So how long did David wait in the pit?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.700]   I don't know, but he waited, he waited.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.380]   And that's what I'm calling for.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.380]   So I pray that this grieving unnamed couple
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.300]   will be brought out into the light of hope
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.900]   and joy in due time,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.840]   not in any glib way that minimizes the loss,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.120]   but with all the work in their hearts
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.660]   that God is doing for their good,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.760]   and no doubt through them for the good of others.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.940]   - Yes, excellent counsel.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.860]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.520]   It's amazing how many emails we get
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.460]   where you, the listener, opens up to us
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.920]   about the rawest pains of life
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.300]   that you're experiencing.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.000]   And I only wish that we could respond
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.260]   to all of those emails,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.860]   but we are so limited in proportion
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.940]   to the number of emails that flood our inbox.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.540]   Nevertheless, we plot on and try to answer what we can
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.000]   and publish the Ask Pastor John podcast three times a week.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.480]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.900]   and search our episode archive
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.500]   and even send us emails from your own pains in life.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.340]   You can do all of that through our online home
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.660]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.780]   We're gonna return on Monday
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.120]   and we're gonna look at something Pastor John has said
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.720]   online, essentially, the coming kingdom of Christ
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.440]   is bad news.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.760]   And a number of you have wondered
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.840]   how the coming kingdom of Jesus Christ
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.220]   is not purely good news.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.800]   It's an interesting pushback we have recently gotten.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.120]   Then I'll ask Pastor John to explain himself next time
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.660]   on the other side of the weekend.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.860]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.020]   (upbeat music)
