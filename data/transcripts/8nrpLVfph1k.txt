[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Next question, EJ, a 39 year old software engineer from Australia.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.760]   How do you balance an ambitious plan for a future deep life while finding contentment
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   in the life you have right now?
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.560]   Well, this is a complicated one.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.680]   And I say complicated because I can speak from my own experience and my own struggles
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   with this issue.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.840]   I was reflecting on this and I realized there's been different periods of my adult life where
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.080]   I've had different relationships with this issue.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   There's been periods of my adult life where I am very focused on the now.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600]   What's going on in my life right now, finding gratitude in it, finding enjoyment in it.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.320]   And those are actually pretty meaningful periods of my life.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.640]   I do look back at those with nostalgia.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   And there's other periods of my life where I'm very future focused.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280]   Things are happening and it's harder for me to get to the now, which has its own issues
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   with it.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.560]   So let me be more specific.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.040]   Thinking back on my life, my postdoc years at MIT, my postdoc years at MIT, I remember
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.200]   as a time where I was very focused on my life in the moment.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   So Julie and I lived on Beacon Hill during my postdoc years.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   I really liked it on Beacon Hill in Boston.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.960]   I mean, it looks like a movie about colonial America.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   It's cobblestone streets.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.200]   They have gas lamps and like fogs would come in off of the river.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.160]   I mean, you really feel like you're living in Dickensian novel.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.480]   And I really enjoyed that.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.640]   It was like you're just this interesting, intellectually interesting place.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.120]   I wasn't that caught up in work.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   I was writing a book.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   I was writing So Good They Can't Ignore You and enjoying that.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.480]   My first year of a postdoc, I was just postdoc and I was writing research papers.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.000]   I wasn't even really doing academic job searching yet.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.440]   For some reason, I wasn't very worried about academic job searching.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.080]   I probably should have been more worried, but it wasn't a source of stress for me.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.480]   And I just had a lot of time where I would just focus on enjoyable things in the moment.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.520]   Like let's read The Transcendentalist by the Banks of the Charles.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.680]   So I did a lot of that.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.960]   I ran every day year round for lunch along the Charles.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.400]   Snow, heat, throughout.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.120]   I got really into monitoring the seasons on my walk to work.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.680]   So the same walk over the Longfellow Bridge.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.240]   Okay, now this tree has leaves.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   Now this doesn't.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.600]   You can tell I was reading a lot of Thoreau at this time.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.480]   So that was often coming in.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   I would get lost.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080]   I'd read or listen to fantasy novels and just kind of get lost.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   Like what a cool world.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   I had a dog at this point.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.640]   Was just spending a lot of time like training the dog and going for walks.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   Because I had a fake job as a postdoc and Julie had a real job.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.000]   I had a lot of just alone time.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.060]   Just a lot of time to fill doing whatever I thought might be interesting.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.280]   And so that's just how I remember that time.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.640]   Was really, really seeking out just things that were interesting or things I was enjoying
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   about the moment.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   Now compare that to right now.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.760]   I feel very different right now because there's a lot of interesting developments happening.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.900]   Not in a period of stasis.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.320]   We have the sort of online media company.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   Jesse knows about this.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.960]   Like a lot of interesting stuff is happening, right?
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   I mean, a lot of things are on the horizon.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.920]   Things are moving.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.280]   That's interesting.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   Interesting stuff's happening at Georgetown with the research I'm doing now, the research
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.640]   I'm shifting into, some of the public facing work I'm happening.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.600]   Professionally speaking, there's just a lot of places where I'm hitting on all cylinders.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   Interesting opportunities are coming and going away.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.820]   And so it's very difficult not to be focused on all these things that are developing or
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.340]   potentially coming.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.820]   And I've noted like, I kind of miss the just extended gracious enjoyment of the moment
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.360]   that I've had at other parts of my life.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.920]   But this is all trade-offs.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.520]   So I would say during that period back on Beacon Hill, yeah, there was a lot more just,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   "Hey, I'm enjoying the spring sun by the Charles and reading a copy of Thoreau."
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.080]   But I think also there's probably more anxiety in that period.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.560]   I mean, everything felt a little bit uncertain.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.280]   There's this kind of background current of uncertainty, this little, some nagging stuff
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.440]   in the background.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.200]   Whereas right now, there's a lot of excitement and stuff that's happening.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.440]   I'm proud of things that are happening.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.640]   There's a lot of long efforts starting to pay off.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.660]   So like, that's a nice thing about now.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.240]   And so they have their pluses, they have their pluses, they have their minuses.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.840]   But these things kind of ebb and flow.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.520]   Anyways, here's my solution, and I'll offer this to you, is that when you're in those
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.660]   periods where you're just present, you're Paul Jarvis on the island and you have some
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.560]   course you're working on, but mainly just spending time in your greenhouse, like working
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.040]   on your garden, have something that you're working on in the background to be excited
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   about.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.240]   Values driven, would open up interesting opportunities in your life or have an impact on the world,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.880]   sticks within your vision of your lifestyle, but it's something new that you're heading
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   towards.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.600]   So that's how you offset the anxiety of unstable stasis.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.280]   If you're instead in a period like me now, do hard work shutdowns every day, shutdown
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280]   complete.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   Planning, even if it's exciting, I'm not going to do any more planning thoughts about
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   a new segment for the show or what's going to happen with this new book chapter, this
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.960]   new research paper, working on hard shutdowns and make them hard, trust them.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.000]   And then do a source of gratitude every night.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.320]   I am going to go on a walk or do something with the kids or go see this movie where I'm
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.920]   going to sort of force myself to just be gracious about the moment, to try to generate that
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.040]   physical sensation of gratitude.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.320]   And it's like a muscle you're trying to get those grooves in your brain engraved.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.260]   That's what I've been trying to do.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.560]   Some periods I'm better than that at others, but when I really get in that pattern, it
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   really does help.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.360]   So that's my advice.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.840]   You have these yin and yang periods and whichever one you're in, you need to properly offset
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.600]   it so that you don't fall too far, too far into that particular, that particular direction.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.480]   Here's a quiz, Jesse, what famous, I don't know why anyone would know this, but what
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.600]   famous, uh, thriller writer has long lived on Beacon Hill?
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.840]   Brandon Sanderson.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   It is where Beacon Hill is where Brandon Sanderson wrote name of the wind.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.040]   So little known fact, Robin cook, Robin cook, who writes the medical thrillers.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   Okay.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.440]   Because Beacon Hill is right next to Charles MGH.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.520]   So a really good hospital in Boston and he was a ophthalmology, I think, resident or
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.600]   fellow.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.760]   So he was living on Beacon Hill.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.200]   So there's doctors, which is another cool thing about Beacon Hill.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.360]   I mean, the houses are really narrow.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.160]   They're kind of small, but they're awesome.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.200]   And there's doctors from the hospital who live there.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.400]   And when you get the big snow storms in Boston, they cross country ski to the hospital.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.800]   So you would see them, not like tons of them, but there's at least one or two doctors.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   We knew that when cross country ski down to the hospital.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.600]   Anyways, he was living there and then he hit it big with his, uh, whatever his first thriller
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   was.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.400]   And so he's just been there ever since.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.480]   So he quit medicine because he was killing it on the books.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.360]   But I went to see him speak when I lived there because of the Beacon Hill civic association.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   He would like once a year, like come and give a talk.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   And it was actually fascinating.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:29.440]   He was like, he gave a talk about how he became a thriller writer and he basically like took
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.000]   a bunch of existing thrillers and broke them all down and wrote on index cards, like all
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.880]   the different types of beats you would see in these thrillers.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.760]   Like I don't know, uh, being chased through a whatever the reversal, the whatever.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.840]   And then just like took out all these index cards and just tried to figure out how many
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.080]   of these can I get into my book.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.560]   And he would just organize them and then write his book along that way.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.760]   So I thought that was interesting.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:57.040]   And the other thing we learned from him is he was involved in, he was in the Navy and
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.920]   was involved in submarines.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:06.600]   It was like a ship's doctor on submarines and also was involved in scuba, early scuba
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.840]   experimentation with decompression chambers and everything.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.160]   And so there was periods of times where he was on submarines and when he was in decompression
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.860]   chambers for a week after doing deep dives, he brought his typewriter with him.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.520]   So ultimate deep worker right there is he, he said I had nothing to do, but basically
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.240]   when I was in the decompression chamber, the internet with a typewriter, it's kind of like
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.080]   the shiny that I'd be worried about it.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.520]   Anyways, interesting guy.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   He wears like weird pants.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   That's what you need to know.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.440]   He wears pants with patterns on them.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.220]   (upbeat music)
