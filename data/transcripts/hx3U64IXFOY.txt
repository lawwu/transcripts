[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.800]   My name is Andrew Huberman
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.080]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.840]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.800]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.920]   to bring you zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880]   about science and science-related tools.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.920]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.440]   Our first sponsor is Headspace.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.880]   Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.040]   I've been meditating on and off now for about 30 years,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.560]   although I confess more off than on.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.220]   And that's because I think, like, for a lot of people,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.600]   sticking to a meditation practice can be pretty challenging.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.920]   I started using Headspace a few years ago,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.660]   and I found that it's really allowed me
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.460]   to stick to a meditation practice on a regular basis.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.640]   I meditate anywhere from five to seven times a week.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.600]   The app includes meditations that are all backed
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.960]   by scientific peer-reviewed studies,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.980]   and it makes it really easy to start
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.660]   and complete the meditations.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.060]   I started using these meditations
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.360]   while I was flying a few years back.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.280]   On JetBlue flights,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.960]   they started offering Headspace meditation,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   so that's where I initially started,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120]   and then I moved over to the app, and I really enjoy it,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240]   and I derive great benefit from it.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.720]   If you'd like to try Headspace,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.160]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.460]   and if you do that, you'll get all the meditations
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.980]   that Headspace offers for free for one month.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.140]   That's headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.520]   You get all the meditations for free,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.860]   which is the best offer that Headspace has
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.580]   available right now, so if you're interested in it,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.420]   check it out.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.620]   The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.380]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.060]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.100]   I started using Athletic Greens in 2012,
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.800]   and I've been using it continuously ever since.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.440]   I started using Athletic Greens
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.500]   because I found it rather dizzying to know
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.640]   which vitamins and minerals to take,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.480]   and Athletic Greens allows me to get the full base
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.220]   of all the necessary vitamins and minerals
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.640]   in one easy-to-consume drink.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.980]   It also turns out that the drink tastes quite good.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.260]   I mix mine with some lemon juice and some water.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.380]   I'll drink it once or twice a day.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.120]   The probiotics in Athletic Greens are also important to me
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.740]   because there are a lot of data now supporting
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.080]   the fact that the gut microbiome is important
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.560]   for the gut-brain axis,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.500]   for various aspects of cognitive function, immune function,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400]   metabolic function, just a huge number of things
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.140]   that having a healthy gut microbiome
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.580]   has been shown to be important for.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.300]   So by taking Athletic Greens,
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.940]   I have that base covered as well.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.360]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.660]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.100]   and if you do that, they'll give you a year's supply
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.880]   of liquid vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.340]   There are also a lot of data now showing
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.440]   that vitamin D3 is very important
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.240]   for a number of different biological functions.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   In addition, they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.680]   with your order.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.480]   It can be difficult to mix up powders while on the road,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.540]   you know, when in a car or, you know,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.180]   in a hotel or on a plane, et cetera.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.640]   The travel packs make everything really clean and easy.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.420]   So you'll get the year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.920]   plus the five free travel packs
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.680]   if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.480]   The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.160]   Made For is a behavioral science company
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   that makes learning positive habits and growth mindset easy.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.380]   I've been involved with Made For since the beginning
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.080]   as the lead of their scientific advisory.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.980]   Other members of the scientific advisory include,
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.040]   for instance, the head of the Chronobiology Unit
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.620]   as well as psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.080]   and elsewhere, all of whom are serious about science
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   and science-related tools for developing positive habits
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.520]   and growth mindset.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.580]   The program is a 10-month program
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.960]   during which each month you engage in a specific activity
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.900]   designed to encourage and cultivate positive habits
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.220]   and growth mindset.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160]   As well, we hold a monthly Zoom call
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.920]   during which we discuss the program, people's progress,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   and answer any questions they have directly.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.480]   If you'd like to try Made For, you can go to getmadefor.com,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.300]   and if you put Huberman in at checkout,
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.960]   you'll get 20% off the program.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.580]   That's getmadefor.com.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.680]   Put Huberman in at checkout and get 20% off the program.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   how to change your nervous system for the better.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460]   As you recall, your nervous system
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.280]   includes your brain and your spinal cord,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.240]   but also all the connections that your brain and spinal cord
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.500]   make with the organs of your body
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.320]   and all the connections that the organs of your body
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.520]   make with your brain and spinal cord.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.180]   Now, this thing that we call the nervous system
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.800]   is responsible for everything we know,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400]   all our behavior, all our emotions,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.080]   everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.160]   everything we think and believe, it's really at the center
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.440]   of our entire experience of life and who we are.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   Fortunately, in humans, unlike in other species,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.520]   we can change our nervous system
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.000]   by taking some very specific and deliberate actions.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.140]   And today, we're really going to focus on the actions,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.140]   the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.840]   that allow us to change our nervous system.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.280]   It turns out that movement and balance
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.120]   actually provide windows or portals into our ability
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.600]   to change our nervous system the way we want,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   even if those changes are not about learning new movements
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.320]   or learning how to balance, and soon you'll understand why.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.480]   So today, we're going to talk a lot about
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.520]   the basic science of neuroplasticity.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.120]   I promise to not use excessive nomenclature,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.240]   there'll be a little bit,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.820]   but I'll try and make it as clear as possible.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.540]   And we're also going to talk a lot about protocols and tools
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.620]   that the scientific literature points to and supports
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.400]   for changing our nervous system.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.380]   Again, not just for sake of learning new motor movements
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.000]   or how to balance better, but for how to feel differently
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.760]   about particular experiences, both past, present and future,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.680]   as well as how to learn faster.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.640]   We're not going to discuss hacks, a word I loathe,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.600]   we're not going to discuss gimmicks,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.160]   we're going to discuss mechanism and scientific data
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.020]   and the tools that those mechanisms and scientific data
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.300]   point to so that you can tailor your practices
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.280]   around learning to your specific needs and goals.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.100]   So let's begin by just examining the big picture question,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.100]   which is does the brain control behavior?
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.580]   And my hope is that everyone is immediately thinking yes.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.240]   The brain and nervous system, we really should say,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.580]   'cause the brain is just one component of the nervous system
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.800]   controls our behavior.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.300]   How does it do that?
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.060]   Well, there are a couple of different levels
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.400]   that it does that.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.140]   First of all, if we're talking about movement,
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.680]   behavior generally means movement.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.080]   If we're talking about movement,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.000]   we have two categories of neurons
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.560]   that are very important to think about
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.200]   in the context of neuroplasticity.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.000]   First of all, we have what are called lower motor neurons.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.900]   These are motor neurons that live in our spinal cord.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.520]   If for the aficionados out there,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.500]   for those of you that might be head to medical school
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.940]   or just want to learn more about the anatomy,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.860]   they live in the ventral horn of the spinal cord,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.260]   but that doesn't matter.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.540]   If you don't want to know that,
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.680]   just know that you have these things
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   called lower motor neurons.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.180]   These are neurons that are in the spinal cord,
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.580]   but they extend a wire that we call an axon
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.180]   out into the peripheral nervous system, into the body.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.900]   And those neurons connect with muscle.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.080]   They send electrical potentials out there
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.860]   that allow our muscles to twitch and to contract.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.500]   As a little point of fact, actually,
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.020]   we don't have muscle memory.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.920]   There's no such thing as muscle memory.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.300]   Muscles are dumb.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.900]   They don't know anything.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.260]   They don't have a history.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.320]   They don't have a memory.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.300]   They don't know anything.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.460]   It is the neurons that control those muscles
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.500]   and their firing patterns in which all the information
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.840]   for motor patterns are stored.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.380]   So your ability to walk is not muscle memory,
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.140]   it's neural memory.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.500]   Now, the lower motor neurons,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.160]   while smarter than the muscle, so to speak,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.180]   are not the most brilliant of the motor neurons.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.360]   They are generally involved in doing what they are told.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.140]   And they are told what to do from two sources.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.560]   We have circuits in our brainstem.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.540]   So this would be kind of around your neck, deep in the brain
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.160]   that are called central pattern generators.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.940]   These are sometimes called CPGs.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.980]   Central pattern generators are what allow us
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.780]   to generate repetitive patterns of movement.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.360]   So inhaling and exhaling, inhaling and exhaling,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.160]   subconsciously is controlled by a central pattern generator.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.000]   That just means a collection of neurons.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.840]   If you really want to know,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.220]   they're called the pre-bot singer neurons
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.860]   discovered by Jack Feldman and colleagues at UCLA.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.020]   These neurons in the brainstem send information
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.620]   down the phrenic nerve and control the diaphragm.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.700]   So it goes inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.860]   And you don't have to think about that.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.120]   You could think about it and you could change the durations
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.380]   of inhales and exhales and change that up.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.100]   But the motor neurons that control that are just responding
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.340]   to what the brain is telling it to do.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.180]   The other central pattern generators
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.860]   include things like walking.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.840]   The right limb, left limb, right limb, left limb pattern
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.820]   that we normally associate with walking
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.300]   was learned during childhood.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.640]   And the central pattern generator, sometimes called CPGs,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.960]   tell our lower motor neurons fire.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.400]   Now you fire, now you fire.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   So they are literally saying right, left, right, left.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.000]   They are the marching orders from the brainstem
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.400]   to the lower motor neurons.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.320]   So these lower motor neurons do what they are told.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.120]   They are obedient little soldiers
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   and they do what they are told.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.380]   And their job is to make the muscles contract
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.440]   at specific times.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.140]   Okay, that's all simple.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.360]   But then there are the upper motor neurons.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.820]   The upper motor neurons actually reside in our motor cortex,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.000]   way up on top of the brain.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.360]   And they are involved in sending signals
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.720]   for deliberate action, okay?
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.320]   So they send signals to the lower motor neurons,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.280]   which are the effectors,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.840]   the ones that actually control the muscles,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.960]   but the upper motor neurons are the ones
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.020]   that send very specific signals.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.180]   For instance, the signals that would allow you
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.960]   to make a cup of coffee in the morning
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.020]   or to deliberately engage in any kind of behavior.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.200]   Now you can probably make a cup of coffee in the morning
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640]   without having to think about it too much.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   It's almost reflexive for you now,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.960]   which means that a lot of the information
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.520]   about how to perform that particular movement
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.220]   has been passed off to circuitry
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.000]   that's now more or less in the brainstem
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   and below the motor cortex.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.360]   Now, why am I giving you all this detail?
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.200]   Well, if you want to change motor patterns,
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.760]   you have to know where in the circuitry changes are possible
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.260]   and you ought to know where the changes
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.300]   are most likely to occur.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.980]   You also need to know how do you signal
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.500]   to the brain and nervous system that a change is necessary.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.560]   So let's just pause there,
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.800]   return to the initial question that we started with,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.180]   which is does the brain control behavior?
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.720]   And the answer is yes, and now you know how.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.780]   It's upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.680]   You've got these things called central pattern generators
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.880]   and some connection with the muscle.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.720]   So there you go.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.680]   So we've just got basically what was the equivalent
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.260]   of the introduction to a college lecture
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.560]   on motor control in the nervous system,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.240]   but the point today is all about plasticity.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.920]   How can that be leveraged in order to open up
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.720]   this magical thing that we call plasticity
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.480]   in order to access changes to our emotional experience
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   or to our belief system or to our ability to remember
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.360]   and use specific kinds of information
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   for say math or language, et cetera?
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.980]   Well, what I'm not going to tell you
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.340]   is that you need to go running or you need to go biking
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.260]   or that simply going through motor patterns
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.840]   is going to open up plasticity,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.320]   because I hate to tell you this,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.960]   but as beneficial as exercise is,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   it does not open plasticity unless you do certain things.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.440]   And I will tell you exactly
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.640]   what those certain things are today.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.120]   To be clear, I think exercise is wonderful and healthy,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.640]   can improve cardiovascular function,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.420]   maintain strength, bone density, all that good stuff,
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.600]   but just working out or doing your exercise
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.680]   of various kinds will not change your nervous system.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.880]   It will maintain it
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.320]   and it can certainly improve other health metrics,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.920]   but it is not going to open up the window for plasticity.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.680]   The question we need to ask
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.240]   is can behavior change the brain?
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   We already agreed that the brain can change behavior,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.200]   but can behavior change the brain?
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.000]   And the answer is yes, provided that behavior
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.600]   is different enough in specific ways
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.840]   from the behaviors that you already know how to perform.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.920]   Let me repeat that.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.880]   Can behavior change the brain?
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.420]   And the answer is yes,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.160]   provided that behavior is different enough
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.480]   from the sorts of behaviors
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.940]   that you already know how to perform.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.280]   And I should have added the word well,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.760]   because you can't obviously perform a behavior
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.540]   that you don't know how to perform
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.920]   because you don't know how to do it yet.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.440]   But there's a key element to accessing neuroplasticity
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.000]   that frankly, I don't see out there
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.060]   in the general discussion about neuroplasticity.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.200]   In the general discussion about neuroplasticity
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   and about learning, I hear all these gimmicks
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.240]   about using different ways to remember lots of people's names
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.600]   and arranging things into their first letters
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.320]   and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.880]   which frankly to me feels really gimmicky.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.320]   And I think that if you look at super learners,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.960]   they tend to be people that have a process
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.440]   of say extreme memory,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.820]   but people who have extreme memory,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.760]   generally the literature shows us
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   are pretty poor at other things.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.240]   So I don't think most of us are interested
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.880]   in walking around knowing how to remember everything.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.900]   In fact, there are some interesting studies
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.600]   looking at humans who over-remember
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.040]   and they suffer tremendously
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.520]   because they remember all sorts of things
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.880]   like the number at the top of the receipt at the bodega
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.420]   that they bought at Coca-Cola 10 years ago.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.120]   This is useless information for most people.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.960]   They don't do well in life really.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.720]   So the goal isn't to remember everything,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.600]   the goal is to be selective about your brain changes.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.200]   And when we talk about brain changes,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.300]   I want to highlight adaptive changes.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.800]   There's a whole category of things
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.680]   that we're going to discuss
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.000]   when we talk about traumatic brain injury and dementia,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.480]   a topic for a future episode,
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   about all the things that happen
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.520]   when you have damaged your nervous system
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   or you're missing neurons.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.640]   But today, I really want to talk about
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.400]   something that I think is very near and dear
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.240]   to many of your hearts,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.880]   which is what are the behaviors that you can engage in
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.120]   to access neuroplasticity
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.400]   so that then you can apply that plasticity
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.420]   to the specific things that you want to learn or unlearn.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.720]   This is very important
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.140]   because I don't want people to get the impression
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.080]   that we're really talking about
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.880]   learning a bunch of motor movements.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.260]   You might want to learn how to dance, you might not.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.560]   You might want to learn how to dance
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.120]   and get better at remembering and learning languages,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.640]   for instance, or at unlearning
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.700]   some difficult emotional experience,
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.680]   meaning you want to remove the emotional load
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.080]   from a particular memory of an experience.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.760]   What we're talking about today is using behavior as a gate
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.840]   to enter states of mind and body
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.880]   that allow you to access plasticity.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.220]   So let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.420]   that are available to us,
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.480]   because those will point directly
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.800]   towards the type of protocols that we should engage in
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.580]   to change ourselves for the better,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.500]   the so-called adaptive plasticity.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.740]   There is something called representational plasticity.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.200]   Representational plasticity
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.280]   is just your internal representation of the outside world.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.220]   So you have a map of auditory space, believe it or not,
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.060]   meaning you have neurons that respond
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.300]   when something over on my right happens,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.360]   like I'm snapping my fingers over to my right,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   can't snap as well on my left,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.980]   which is the whole thing into itself.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.840]   Yeah, weak over there on the left side.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.400]   But when I do that,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.320]   there are different neurons respond to those.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.240]   We have a map of visual space.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.500]   Certain neurons are seeing things
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.620]   in certain portions of visual space and not others.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.300]   We have a map of motor space,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.760]   meaning when we move our limbs in particular directions,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.020]   we know where those limbs are
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.200]   because even if we can't see them,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.440]   we have what's called proprioceptive feedback.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.580]   So we have knowledge about where our limbs are.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.920]   In fact, people that lack certain neurons
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.060]   for proprioceptive feedback,
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.120]   they are very poor at controlling their motor behavior.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.200]   They get injured a lot.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.520]   It's actually a terrible situation.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.920]   So we've got all these representations inside
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.160]   and we have maps of our motor commands.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.340]   We know that, for instance,
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.180]   if I want to reach out and grab the pen in front of me,
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.460]   that I need to generate a certain amount of force,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.260]   so I rarely overshoot.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.760]   I rarely miss the pen, okay?
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.480]   So our maps of the motor world
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.440]   and our maps of the sensory world are merged.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.520]   The way to create plasticity
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.280]   is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.220]   And this, I think, is an amazing and important feature
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.000]   of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.800]   The way to create plasticity
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.340]   is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong,
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.820]   something is different, and something isn't being achieved.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.460]   I think this will completely reframe
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.240]   the way that most people think about plasticity.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   Most of us think about plasticity as,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.080]   okay, we're going to get into this optimal learning state
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.240]   or flow, and then suddenly we're going to be able
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.460]   to do all the things that we wish that we could do.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.400]   Well, I hate to break it to you,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.920]   but flow is an expression of what we already know how to do.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.760]   It is not a state for learning.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.840]   And I'm willing to go to bat
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.880]   with any of the flow anistas out there
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.680]   that want to challenge me on that one.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.960]   Flow is an expression of nervous system capabilities
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.760]   that are already embedded in us.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.360]   Errors and making errors out of sync
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.080]   with what we would like to do
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.360]   is how our nervous system is cued
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.960]   through very distinct biological mechanisms
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.480]   that something isn't going right,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.680]   and therefore certain neurochemicals are deployed
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.920]   that'll signal the neural circuits that they have to change.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.480]   So let's talk about the experiments
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.640]   that support what I just said,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.160]   'cause I'm about to tell you that making errors
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.280]   over and over and over again
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   is the route to shaping your nervous system
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.080]   so that it performs better and better and better.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.380]   And I'm not going to tell you that the last rep of a set
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.920]   where you hit failure in the gym
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.280]   is anything like neuroplasticity.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.240]   You hear that too, that it's pushing to that point
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.900]   of a cliff where you just can't function anymore.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   That's the signal, that's not the signal.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.800]   That's a distinct neuromuscular phenomenon
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.520]   that bears zero resemblance
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.720]   to what it takes to get neuroplasticity.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.580]   So let's talk about errors and making errors
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.720]   and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   that then allow us to not just learn the thing
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.840]   that we're doing in the motor sense,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.940]   play the piano, dance, et cetera,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.720]   but it also creates an environment to mill you
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.400]   within the brain that allows us to then go learn
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.320]   how to couple or uncouple a particular emotion
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.820]   to an experience or better language learning
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.760]   or better mathematical learning.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.180]   It's a really fundamental aspect of how we're built.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.480]   And when you look at it,
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.000]   it's actually very straightforward.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.920]   It's a series of logical steps
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.120]   that once you learn how to open those hatches,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.020]   it becomes very straightforward to deploy.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.680]   Last episode, we discussed some of the basic principles
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.520]   of neuroplasticity.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   If you didn't hear that episode, no problem.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.300]   I'll just review it quickly,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.440]   which is that it's a falsehood that everything that we do
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.360]   and experience changes our brain.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.600]   The brain changes when certain neurochemicals,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.060]   namely acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.880]   are released in ways and in the specific times
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.840]   that allow for neural circuits to be marked for change,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.120]   and then the change occurs later during sleep.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.980]   I'll review that later,
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.600]   but basically you need a certain cocktail of chemicals
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.120]   released in the brain in order for a particular behavior
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.060]   to reshape the way that our brain works.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.880]   So the question really is,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.580]   what allows those neurochemicals to be released?
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.960]   And last episode, it talked all about focus.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.500]   If you haven't seen or heard that episode,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.760]   you might want to check it out
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.060]   about some specific tools and practices
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.740]   that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.320]   and release certain chemicals in that cocktail.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.180]   But today we're going to talk about the other chemicals
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.560]   in the cocktail, in particular dopamine.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   And we're really going to center our discussion
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.420]   around this issue of making errors and why making errors
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.580]   is actually the signal that tells the brain,
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.300]   okay, it's time to change, or more generally,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.220]   it's time to pay attention to things so that you change.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.380]   And I really want to distinguish this point really clearly,
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.300]   which is that I'm going to talk today a lot about motor
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.900]   and vestibular, meaning balance programs,
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.800]   but not just for learning motor commands and balance,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.740]   not just for learning new motor skills and balance,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.980]   but also for setting a stage or a kind of condition
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.780]   in your brain where you can go learn other things as well.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.540]   So let's talk about some classic experiments
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.020]   that really nail down what's most important
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.540]   in this discussion about plasticity.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.740]   So I mentioned last episode,
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.460]   and I'll just tell you right now, again,
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.320]   the brain is incredibly plastic from about birth
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.020]   until about age 25.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.620]   Passive experience will shape the brain
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.880]   just because of the way that the chemicals
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.380]   that are sloshing around in there
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.000]   and the way that the neurons are arranged
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.200]   and all sorts of things.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.620]   The brain's job is to customize itself
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.080]   in response to its experience.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.280]   And then somewhere about 25,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.640]   it's not like the day after your 26th birthday,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.380]   plasticity closes, there's a kind of tapering off
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.120]   of plasticity and you need different mechanisms
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.220]   to engage plasticity as an adult.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.520]   We're mostly going to be talking about adult plasticity today
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.480]   but I got a lot of questions about,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.940]   well, what about if I'm younger than 25?
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.520]   First of all, that's great.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.200]   I wish I had a time machine, but I don't.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.820]   Because as I've said before,
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.540]   the stinger is when you're young,
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.660]   your brain is very plastic
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.620]   but you have less control over your experience.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.520]   When you're older,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.540]   generally you have more control over your experience
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.360]   but your brain is less plastic.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.080]   So if you're already asking the question
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.800]   as a 20 year old or a 15 year old,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.200]   what can I do now that's really gonna enhance my brain?
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.080]   I guess the simple question would answer,
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.600]   excuse me, would be an aside
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.640]   which we get the broadest education you can possible.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.600]   That means math, chemistry, physics, literature, music,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.760]   learn how to play an instrument.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.440]   I'm saying that 'cause I wish I had, et cetera.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   Get a broad training in a number of things
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.000]   and find the thing that really captures your passion
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.220]   and excitement and then put a ton of additional effort there.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.480]   That's what I recommend, including emotional development.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.560]   Maybe a topic for a future episode.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   But if you are an adult or if you are a young person,
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.760]   knowing how to tap into these plasticity mechanisms
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.800]   is very powerful.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.680]   You need these chemicals deployed in the nervous system
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.880]   in order to mark whatever nerve cells happen to be firing
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.760]   in the time afterward for change.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   And people are obsessed with asking,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.360]   what supplements, what drugs, what conditions,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.000]   what machines will allow for that?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.500]   But there's a natural set of conditions that allow for that.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.360]   When we came into this world,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.960]   we learned to take our different maps of experience,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.460]   our motor maps, our auditory maps, our visual maps,
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.840]   and to link them, we align those maps.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.000]   The simplest example is the one I gave before.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.480]   If I hear something off to my right, like a click,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.160]   like that, it could come from my finger snapping
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.660]   or it could come from something generated by somebody else
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.300]   or something else to my right.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.380]   I look to my right.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.900]   If I hear it on the left, I look to my left.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.580]   If I hear it right in front of me,
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.860]   I keep looking right in front of me.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.900]   And if I hear it behind me, I turn around.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.720]   And that's because our maps of visual space
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   and our maps of auditory space and our maps of motor space
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.120]   are aligned to one another in perfect register.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.160]   It's an incredible feature of our nervous system.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.700]   It takes place in a structure called the superior colliculus,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.900]   although you don't need to know that name.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.140]   Superior colliculus has layers, literally stacks of neurons
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.500]   like in a sandwich where the zero point right in front of me
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.000]   or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.220]   or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.540]   are aligned so that the auditory neurons,
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.340]   the ones that care about sounds at 15 degrees to my right,
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.140]   sit directly below the neurons that look at 15 degrees
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.040]   to my right in my visual system.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.100]   And when I reach over to this direction,
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.960]   there's a signal that's sent down through those layers
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.740]   that says 15 degrees off to the right
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.180]   is the direction to look, it's the direction to listen,
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.200]   and it's the direction to move if I need to move.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.700]   So there's an alignment.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.940]   And this is really powerful.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.940]   And this is what allows us to move through space
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.220]   and function in our lives in a really fluid way.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.220]   It's set up during development,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.880]   but there have been some important experiments
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.860]   that have revealed that these maps are plastic,
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.140]   meaning they can shift, they're subject to neuroplasticity,
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.280]   and there are specific rules that allow us to shift them.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.780]   So here's the key experiment.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.620]   The key experiment was done by a colleague of mine,
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.460]   who's now retired, but whose work is absolutely fundamental
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.300]   in the field of neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.860]   The Knudsen lab and many of the Knudsen lab
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.440]   scientific offspring showed that if one
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.300]   is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual field,
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.040]   that eventually there'll be a shift
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   in the representation of the auditory and motor maps too.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.800]   Now, what they initially did
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.040]   is they looked at young subjects.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.080]   And what they did is they moved the visual world
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.440]   by making them wear prism glasses,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.800]   so that, for instance, if my pen is out in front of me
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.600]   at five degrees off center,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.880]   so just a little bit off center,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.700]   if you're listening to this,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.280]   this would be like just a little bit to my right,
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.460]   but in these prism glasses,
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.760]   I actually see that pen way over far on my right.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.880]   So it's actually here, but I see it over there
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.920]   because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.820]   What happens is in the first day or so,
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.120]   you ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.420]   to reach for this object and they reach to the wrong place
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.580]   because they're seeing it where it isn't.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.900]   This gets especially complicated
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.360]   when you start including sounds,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.580]   when you have a thing off to your right making a sound,
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.700]   but the thing is actually right here.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.860]   So you're hearing the sound at one location
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.140]   and you're seeing the object at another location
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.600]   because you're wearing these prisms.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.360]   So your image of the world is totally distorted.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.840]   Or in experiments done by other groups,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.360]   they wear glasses, subjects wear glasses
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.920]   that completely invert the visual world
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.620]   so that everything is upside down,
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.040]   which is an extreme example of these representational maps
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.500]   being flipped or shifted.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.760]   But what you find is that in young individuals,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.560]   within a day or two,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.600]   they start adjusting their motor behavior
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.680]   in exactly the right way
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.080]   so that they always reach to the correct location.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.720]   So they hear a sound at one location,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.440]   they see the object that ought to make that sound
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.560]   at a different location,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.120]   and they somehow are able to adjust their motor behavior
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.520]   to reach to the correct location.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.680]   It's incredible.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.720]   It's absolutely incredible.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.560]   Or in the case of the people who look at the world
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.840]   upside down,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.800]   they somehow are able to navigate this upside down world
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.840]   even though we're completely used to
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.980]   our feet being on the floor and not on the ceiling
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.120]   and people not walking at us
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.320]   by hanging off the ceiling like bats.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.640]   Amazing.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.000]   And what it tells us is that these maps
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.520]   that are aligned to one another
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   can move and shift and rotate and even flip themselves.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.200]   And it happens best in young individuals.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.760]   If you do this in older individuals,
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.740]   in most cases it takes a very long time
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.760]   for the maps to shift.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   And in some cases they never shift.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.680]   So this is a very experimental scenario,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.460]   but it's an important one to understand
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.840]   because it really tamps down the fact
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.060]   that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.160]   in our representation of the outside world.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.480]   So how can we get plasticity as adult
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.160]   that mimics the plasticity that we get when we are juveniles?
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   Well, the Knudsen lab and other labs have looked at this
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.960]   and it's really interesting.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.020]   First of all, we have to ask
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.720]   what is the signal for plasticity?
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.760]   Is it just having prism glasses on?
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.760]   No, because they did that experiment and ruled that out.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.600]   Is it just the fact that the visual thing
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.360]   is over to my, appears to be far over to my right
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.040]   when in fact it's right in front of me?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.000]   No.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.820]   The signal that generates the plasticity
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.180]   is the making of errors.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.480]   It's the reaches and failures
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.040]   that signal to the nervous system
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.140]   that this is not working
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.600]   and therefore the shifts start to take place.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.640]   And this is so fundamentally important
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.740]   because I think most people think,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.440]   oh, well, practice is gonna be,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.340]   I have to access beginner's mind,
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.640]   which is a great concept actually.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   It's about approaching things,
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.480]   expecting to make errors, which is great.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.360]   I think I am a believer in beginner's mind.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.880]   But people understandably get frustrated.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.640]   Like they're trying to learn a piece on the piano
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.080]   and they don't know, they can't do it.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.460]   Or they're trying to write a piece of code
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.800]   or they're trying to access some sort of motor behavior
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.880]   and they can't do it.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.740]   And the frustration drives them crazy.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.900]   And like, I can't do it, I can't do it.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.540]   When they don't realize that the errors themselves
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.560]   are signaling to the brain and nervous system,
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.000]   something's not working.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.480]   And of course the brain doesn't understand the words,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.280]   something isn't working.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.040]   The brain doesn't even understand frustration
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.640]   as an emotional state.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.720]   The brain understands the neurochemicals that are released,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.680]   namely epinephrine and acetylcholine.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.560]   But also, and we'll get into this, the molecule dopamine,
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.200]   when we start to approximate the correct behavior
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.900]   just a little bit,
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.260]   and we start getting a little bit right.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.000]   So what happens is when we make errors,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.760]   the nervous system kind of, I don't wanna say freaks out
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.380]   because it's a very mechanistic and controlled situation,
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.080]   but the nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.880]   and neuromodulators that say,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.000]   we better change something in the circuitry.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.240]   And so errors are the basis for neuroplasticity
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.300]   and for learning.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.400]   And I wish that this was more prominent out there.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.520]   I guess this is why I'm saying it.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.000]   And humans do not like this feeling of frustration
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.220]   and making errors.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.400]   The few that do, do exceedingly well in whatever pursuits
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.080]   they happen to be involved in.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.040]   The ones that don't, generally don't do well.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.520]   They generally don't learn much.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.720]   And if you think about it, why would your nervous system
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.980]   ever change?
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.480]   Why would it ever change?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.760]   Unless there was something to be afraid of,
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.620]   something that made us feel awful will signal
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.360]   that the nervous system needs to change,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.800]   or there's an error in our performance.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.040]   So it turns out that the feedback of these errors,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.560]   the reaching to the wrong location
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.880]   starts to release a number of things.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.600]   And now you've heard about them many times,
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.920]   but this would be epinephrine.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.760]   It increases alertness, acetylcholine focus.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.280]   And this is why frustration that leads us
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.600]   to just kind of quit and walk away from the endeavor
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.500]   is the absolute worst thing.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.080]   But because if acetylcholine is released,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.240]   it creates an opportunity to focus on the error margin,
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.680]   the distance between what it is that you're doing
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.800]   and what it is that you would like to do.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.760]   And then the nervous system starts to make changes
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.440]   almost immediately in order to try
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.800]   and get the behavior right.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.080]   And when you start getting it even a little bit right,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.960]   that third molecule comes online or is released,
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.240]   which is dopamine,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   which allows for the plastic changes to occur very fast.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.200]   Now, this is what all happens very naturally
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.020]   in young brains, but in old brains,
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.200]   it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.920]   So let me just pause and just say this.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.360]   If you are uncomfortable making errors
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.640]   and you get frustrated easily,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.820]   if you leverage that frustration toward drilling deeper
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.500]   into the endeavor, you are setting yourself up
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.040]   for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.380]   But if you take that frustration
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.360]   and you walk away from the endeavor,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.280]   you are essentially setting up plasticity
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.260]   to rewire you according to what happens afterwards,
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.340]   which is generally feeling pretty miserable.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.780]   So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.020]   that continuing to drill into a process
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.260]   to the point of frustration,
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.500]   but then staying with that process for a little bit longer,
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.920]   and I'll define exactly what I mean by a little bit,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   is the most important thing for adult learning,
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.640]   as well as childhood learning,
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.200]   but adult learning in particular.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.680]   Now, the Newton Lab did two very important sets
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.160]   of experiments.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.640]   The first one was published in "Nature,"
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.560]   very important study,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.020]   which showed that juveniles can make these massive shifts
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.260]   in their map representations,
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.400]   meaning you can shift the visual world using visual prisms
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.460]   a huge amount, and very quickly young individuals
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.860]   can shift their representations of the world
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.140]   so that they learn to reach to the correct location.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.520]   They get a lot of plasticity all at once,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.320]   and it happens very fast in a period of just a couple days.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.180]   In adults, it tends to be very slow,
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.760]   and most individuals never actually accomplish
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.840]   the full map shift.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.400]   They don't get the plasticity.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.720]   And here we're talking about map shifts,
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.640]   but this could be learning a new language,
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.080]   this could be any number of different things
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.320]   that one were attempting.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.540]   So what we're saying is what I already said before,
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.720]   which is that we learn very well as youngsters,
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.520]   but not as adults after 25.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.600]   But then what they did is they started making
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.680]   the increment of change smaller.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.520]   So instead of shifting the world a huge amount
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   by putting prisms that shifted the visual world
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.360]   all the way over to the right,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.760]   they did this incrementally.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.800]   So first they put on prisms that shifted it
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.660]   just a little bit, and just like seven degrees,
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.040]   I believe was the exact number.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.240]   And then it was 14 degrees, and then it was 28 degrees.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.960]   And so what they found was that the adult nervous system
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.580]   but that you can stack those errors
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.240]   so that you can get a lot of plasticity.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.480]   Put simply, incremental learning as an adult
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.760]   is absolutely essential.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.940]   You are not going to get massive shifts
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.120]   in your representations of the outside world.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.560]   So how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors?
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   Well, the key is smaller bouts of focused learning
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.000]   for smaller bits of information.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.080]   It's a mistake to try and learn a lot of information
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.560]   in one learning bout as an adult.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.980]   What these papers from the Knudsen Lab show,
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.160]   and what others have gone on to show,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.560]   is that the adult nervous system is fully capable
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.320]   of engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.460]   but you need to do it in smaller increments
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.920]   per learning epoch or per learning episode.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.840]   So how would you do this?
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.920]   Well, let's say, for instance, I'm terrible at free throws.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.600]   So let's say I wanted to learn free throws.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.540]   I'm 45 years old, so I'm well past the 25 and under mark.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.600]   I'm going to make errors.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   I'm going to make a lot of errors.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.560]   If I go into learning free throws,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   knowing that errors are the gate to plasticity,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.840]   well, then I feel a little bit better,
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.400]   but I still have to aim for the rim of the basket
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   or the net, basically showing how little
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.380]   I know about basketball.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.640]   But I think I know the general themes around basketball.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.520]   It involves a net, a backboard, and a ball, of course.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.820]   So I go to the free throw line and I'll throw.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.720]   How long should I go?
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.380]   Well, until I'm hitting the point of frustration,
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:24.480]   and at that point, continuing probably for anywhere
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.860]   from 10 to 100 more trials should be my limit, right?
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.500]   That should be my limit if I want to improve
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.000]   some specific aspect of the motor behavior.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.040]   And so the question then is,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.600]   what should I be paying attention to?
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.640]   What should I be focusing on?
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.840]   Well, obviously trying to get the ball into the basket,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.560]   but the beauty of motor learning is that the circuits
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.160]   for auditory and visual and motor
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.080]   more or less teach themselves.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.340]   I don't necessarily have to be paying attention
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.340]   to exactly what the contact of my fingers with the ball
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.600]   or some random feature like whether or not
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.160]   I'm bending my knees or not.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.200]   The key is to try a number of different parameters
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.680]   until I start to approximate the behavior
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.280]   that I want to get a little bit better
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.640]   and then trying to get consistent about that.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.800]   Now, many of you involved in sports learning will say,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.380]   okay, well, that's obvious, it's just incremental learning.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.800]   But the key thing is in those errors.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.880]   By isolating the errors and making a number of errors
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.080]   in a particular aspect of the motor movement,
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.200]   it signals to the brain that it's plastic.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.440]   And if I leave that episode of going
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.020]   and trying to learn how to shoot free throws,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.620]   my brain is still plastic.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.880]   Plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.120]   It's not just geared toward the specific thing
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.320]   I'm trying to learn.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.160]   So there are two aspects to plasticity
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.440]   that I think we really need to highlight.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.720]   One is that there's plasticity geared toward the thing
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.760]   that you are trying to learn specifically.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.880]   And then there are states of mind and body
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.720]   that allow us to access plasticity.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.120]   Now, toward the end of this episode,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.840]   I'm going to spell out specific protocols
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.780]   in a little more detail.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.280]   That free throw example might not correlate
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.720]   with what you want to learn.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.800]   Actually, I don't have a huge desire to learn free throws.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.080]   I've more or less given up on basketball
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.560]   and free throws in particular.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.300]   But I think that it's important to understand
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.480]   that motor movements are the most straightforward way
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.400]   to access states of plasticity.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.640]   And that can be for sake of learning the motor movement
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.340]   or for sake of accessing plasticity more generally.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.200]   One very important aspect to getting plasticity as an adult
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.640]   is not just smaller increments, meaning shorter bouts.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.480]   So I gave an example of another 100 free throws or something
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.000]   but going out there and just getting my 10,000 free throws
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.280]   all at once or packing as much as I can into one episode
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.480]   is not going to be as efficient for me
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.720]   as shorter bouts of intense learning as an adult.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.200]   Because the error signals are not as well defined.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.040]   To my nervous system,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.320]   it's not going to know what needs to change.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.940]   And so this is really the key element
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.220]   of incremental learning,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.160]   is that you're trying to signal to the nervous system
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.100]   at least one component that needs to change.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.040]   The nervous system needs to know what the error is.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.840]   Now, when I shoot free throws, Lord knows,
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.640]   there are a lot of different kinds of errors that happen.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.000]   Probably the way I'm bending my knees, the arc of the ball,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.400]   the way I'm organizing my shoulder
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.120]   is probably where my eyes are, lots of things.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.160]   So which ones to focus on.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.220]   And that's what I said before,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.680]   the beauty of the motor system is
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.840]   I don't have to worry about all of that.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.400]   I just need to get the reps in a number of times
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.360]   and the nervous system will figure out
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.460]   how far off my motor commands are
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.800]   at the level of these maps that I described earlier,
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   how far those deviate from the desired behavior,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.120]   getting the ball into the basket.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.540]   And it will start making adjustments.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.020]   But as I make adjustments,
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.280]   or as my nervous system makes adjustments for me,
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.040]   the key thing is to not start adding a variety of new errors
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.200]   because then it gets confused.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.260]   And so this is why short learning bouts
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.880]   are absolutely essential.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.040]   So let's say it's for learning an instrument as an adult.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   Probably anywhere from seven minutes to 30 minutes
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.240]   provided that you're fully attending, you're very focused,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.760]   is going to be a pretty significant stimulus
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.320]   to inspire plasticity in the nervous system.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.020]   Now, there is one way to get a lot of plasticity
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.180]   all at once as an adult.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.740]   There is that kind of Holy grail thing of, you know,
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.680]   getting massive plasticity as you would
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.320]   when you were a young person, but as an adult.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.760]   And the Knudsen lab revealed this
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   by setting a very serious contingency on the learning.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.400]   What they did was they had a situation
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.280]   where subjects had to find food
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   that was displaced in their visual world,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.640]   again, by putting prisms.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.680]   And they had to find the food and the food made a noise.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   There was a noise set kind of the location of the food
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.640]   through an array of speakers.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.760]   Basically, what they found was that
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.240]   if people have to adjust their visual world
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.360]   in order to get food, the plasticity would eventually occur,
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.800]   but it was very slow as an adult.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.960]   It was very, very slow.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.700]   Unless they actually had to hunt that food.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.240]   They actually, in order to eat at all,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.960]   they needed plasticity.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.380]   And then what happened was remarkable.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.900]   What they observed is that the plasticity as an adult
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.820]   can be as dramatic, as robust as it is in a young person
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.260]   or in a young animal subject,
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.000]   provided that there's a serious incentive
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.180]   for the plasticity to occur.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.420]   And this is absolutely important to understand,
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.120]   which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.760]   determines how fast that plasticity will arrive,
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.300]   which is incredible because the brain is just neurons
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.540]   and soup of chemicals.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.540]   So what this, but this means that
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.660]   the importance of something,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.460]   how important something is to us,
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.780]   actually gates the rate of plasticity
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.900]   and the magnitude of plasticity.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:06.220]   And this is why just passively going through most things,
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.900]   going through the motions, as we say,
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.700]   or just getting our reps in, quote unquote,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.900]   is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.300]   This study, a beautiful study
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.860]   published in the Journal of Neuroscience
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.800]   shows that if we actually have to accomplish something
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   in order to eat or in order to get our ration of income,
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.200]   we will reshape our nervous system very, very quickly.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.700]   So the nervous system has a capacity to change
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.780]   at a tremendous rate to an enormous degree
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.540]   at any stage of life,
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.860]   provided it's important enough that that happened.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.380]   And I think some of you might be saying,
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.740]   well, duh, that's obvious.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.140]   If it's really crucial,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.240]   then of course it's going to change faster,
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.020]   but it didn't have to be that way.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   And for most people who are trying to learn
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.300]   how to learn faster or learn better,
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.260]   they probably, in most cases,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.100]   they are hitting a limit
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.820]   because the need to change is not crucial enough.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.640]   And I think there are a number of places
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.260]   where this has an important relevance
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.620]   in the people who are battling addiction, for instance.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.420]   I will be the first to say that I sympathize with the fact
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.880]   that addictions have a biological component.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.100]   There's clearly cases where people struggle tremendously
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.140]   to change their behavior and their nervous system,
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.980]   in some cases, is so disrupted
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.100]   by whatever substance they've been abusing
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.940]   or behavior that they've been engaging in
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.540]   that it's that much harder for them to change.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.080]   But we've also seen incredible examples
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.620]   where when people have to change
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.580]   from an internal standpoint,
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.660]   from their own belief and desire to change,
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.140]   that massive change is possible.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.140]   And so I think that the studies that Knudsen did
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.980]   showing that incremental learning
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.460]   can create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.400]   as well as when the contingency is very high,
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.340]   meaning we need to eat or we need to make an income
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.980]   or we need to do something that's vitally important for us,
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:15.220]   that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps,
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.140]   just like they can in adolescence and young adulthood,
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.160]   that points to the fact
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.820]   that it has to be a neurochemical system.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.660]   There has to be an underlying mechanism, right?
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.460]   This wasn't a case of sticking a wire into the brain
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.220]   or taking a particular drug.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.140]   All the chemicals that we're about to talk about
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.400]   are released from drugstores, if you will,
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.820]   chemical stores that already reside in all of our brains.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.240]   And the key is how to tap into those stores.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.140]   And so we're gonna next talk about
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.320]   what are the specific behaviors
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.460]   that liberate particular categories of chemicals
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.620]   that allow us to make the most of incremental learning
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.780]   and that set the stage for plasticity
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.680]   that is similar enough
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.640]   or mimics these high contingency states,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.900]   like the need to get food
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.900]   or really create a sense of internal urgency,
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.980]   chemical urgency, if you will.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.180]   If you've heard previous episodes of this podcast,
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.140]   you may have heard me talk about ultradian rhythms,
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.780]   which are these 90-minute rhythms
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.240]   that break up our 24-hour day.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.580]   They help break up our sleep into different cycles of sleep
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.200]   like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.020]   And in waking states, they help us,
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.540]   or I should say they break up our day
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.600]   in ways that allow us to learn best
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.540]   within 90-minute cycles, et cetera.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.560]   So some of you might be saying,
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.260]   "Wait, you've been talking about ultradian cycles
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.900]   "and a moment ago you were talking about
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.080]   "7-minute or 12-minute or 30-minute learning cycles."
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   Today we're really talking about how to tap into plasticity
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.340]   through the completion of a task
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:53.540]   or working towards something repetitively and making errors.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.000]   And so just to frame this
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.460]   in the context of the ultradian cycle,
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.880]   you might sit down,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.080]   decide that you're going to learn conversational French,
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.160]   which would mean that you probably
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.560]   don't already speak French.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.860]   So you're going to sit down,
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.800]   you're going to decide you're going to learn some nouns
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.020]   and some verbs, you might do some practice sets.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.660]   The ultradian cycle says that for the first
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.880]   five to 10 minutes of doing that,
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.220]   your mind is going to drift
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.300]   and your focus will probably kick in
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.880]   provided that you're restricting your visual world
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.720]   to just the material in front of you,
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.860]   something we talked about last episode,
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.000]   somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.940]   And then at best, you're probably going to get
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.420]   about an hour of deliberate kind of tunnel vision
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.860]   learning in there, your mind will drift.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.160]   And then toward the end of that,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.440]   what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20-minute cycle,
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   you're going to, your brain will start to flicker in and out.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.240]   You might start thinking about what you need to eat
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.020]   or the fact that you have to use the bathroom or something.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.180]   And then by the 90 minutes,
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.040]   it's probably time to just stop the learning bout
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.720]   and go do something else,
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.300]   maybe return for a second learning bout later,
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.160]   but maybe take a nap afterwards or something
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.200]   to enhance the learning,
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.760]   but that it's going to happen within about a 90-minute block
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.440]   you're going to go through that cycle of learning.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.760]   But when I refer to the seven or 12 or 30 minutes
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.200]   of making errors, what I mean is when you're really
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.400]   in a mode of repeating errors, not deliberately,
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.120]   you're trying your best to accomplish something
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.440]   and you're failing.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.020]   You're absolutely failing.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:28.320]   You're trying to remember, say, the sign language alphabet.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.060]   I was trying to teach myself this recently
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.620]   and then I kept repeating and repeating
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.840]   and then get to a certain point where I kept making errors,
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.920]   making errors, making errors.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.780]   You want to keep making errors for this period of time
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.320]   that I'm saying will last anywhere
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.640]   for about seven to 30 minutes.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.920]   It is exceedingly frustrating,
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.860]   but that frustration, it liberates the chemical cues
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.960]   that signal that plasticity needs to happen
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.260]   and they also signal the particular neurons that are active.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.180]   So in the case of sign language,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.040]   it might be the ones that control my hand movements
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.140]   as well as me thinking about what the different letters are.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.960]   It's signaling different components within the networks
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.520]   between the brain and body.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.200]   And it's trying to figure out, wait,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.880]   where are these errors coming from?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.900]   Where are the errors coming from?
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.540]   Ah, it's those neurons.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.840]   They're making the mistakes.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.800]   They're making the mistakes.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.180]   They're making the mistakes.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.580]   And it essentially highlights that pathway for change.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.600]   And it is the case that when we come back a day
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.800]   or two later in a learning bout after a nap
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.920]   or a night or two of deep rest,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.040]   then what we find is that we can remember certain things
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.360]   and the motor pathways work
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.820]   and we don't always get it perfectly,
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.600]   but we get a lot of it right
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.040]   whereas we got it wrong before.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.440]   So that seven to 30 minute intense learning bout
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.020]   is within the ultradian cycle.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.080]   And I wanna be clear about that.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.440]   And some people can tolerate many of these per day.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.720]   Most people can only tolerate one or two, maybe three.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.920]   This is intense work.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.880]   If shooting free throws, you could probably do it all day.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.360]   But what I'm talking about
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.280]   is really trying to accelerate plasticity
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.300]   by having a period of the seven to 30 minutes
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.300]   per learning bout that is specifically about making errors.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.500]   I wanna really underscore that.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.120]   And it's not about, as I mentioned before,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.920]   coming up with some little hack or trick
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.720]   or something of that sort.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.640]   It's really about trying to cue the nervous system
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.960]   that something needs to change
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.560]   because otherwise it simply won't change.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.480]   Now, there's another aspect to learning.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.720]   I think it's only fair to mention,
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.440]   which is that we can all learn very easily
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   when there's something very bad happens to us.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.020]   And I don't wish this on anyone,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.440]   but it is the case that if something really terrible happens
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.300]   that we will have a lifetime memory for that event.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.160]   There are processes that allow us to uncouple
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.600]   the emotional load of that event.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.040]   I talked about some of those a few episodes back,
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.620]   the episode on dreams, trauma, and hallucinations,
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.640]   and we're gonna return to trauma release, PTSD,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.000]   and some of those other themes in a future episode.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.840]   But the reason why negative experiences
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   can be wired into us so quickly
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.260]   is because our nervous system's main job is to keep us safe.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.660]   But at a deeper level,
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.420]   it's because negative experiences cue us
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   to the fact that whatever's happening that's really bad
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.360]   is very different than the other things
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.460]   that tend to happen before.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.180]   So most of our experience doesn't remap us,
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.940]   but those negative experiences
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.240]   deploy high levels of norepinephrine,
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.660]   high levels of acetylcholine,
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.100]   and really make so that whatever it is that we experience
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:40.560]   in that bad episode is essentially cued up,
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.120]   and so we're on the lookout for it.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.800]   And this has a number of negative effects,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.520]   but in terms of psychological and emotional effects,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.360]   but it is really a process designed to keep us safe.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   The other ways in which we can learn more quickly,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.120]   besides just making errors,
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.800]   is when something really surprises us.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.320]   And if we're positively surprised by something,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.340]   or we are just flooded with this molecule dopamine,
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.220]   then there's a great opportunity for plasticity.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.380]   Dopamine is a molecule
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.920]   that's almost always associated with pleasure
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.200]   and with the accomplishment of a particular goal,
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.640]   but it's really also a molecule of motivation.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.920]   It's a molecule that is released inside of us
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.320]   when we think we're on the right path.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.900]   And it does have a capacity to increase neuroplasticity,
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.300]   motivation, et cetera.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.000]   It's released in response to a number of natural behaviors
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.600]   just that help with the progression of ours
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.540]   and other species, things like food, sex,
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.180]   in some sense, social connection,
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.720]   although that's more serotonin,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.880]   and serotonin doesn't have the same effects on plasticity,
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.300]   quite the same, and we'll talk about a few later.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.940]   But dopamine is when we think we're on the right path
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.400]   toward an external goal, a little bit is released,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.040]   and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.500]   I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.340]   by doing the following, learn to attach dopamine
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.140]   in a subjective way to this process of making errors,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.480]   because that's really combining two modes of plasticity
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.840]   in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.780]   So earlier I talked about making errors
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.540]   and having a focus bout of learning
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.940]   that includes making a lot of errors
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.380]   inside of that learning bout.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.860]   That is going to be frustrating,
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.500]   but the frustration itself is the cue,
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.940]   and epinephrine will be very high under those conditions.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.380]   But if you can just subjectively associate that experience
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.800]   with something good and that you want to continue
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.520]   down that path as opposed to quitting
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.900]   when you hit the point of frustration,
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.860]   well, then you now start to create a synergy
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.500]   between the dopamine that's released
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.780]   when we subjectively think something is good
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.660]   or tell ourselves something is good
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.220]   and that situation of making failures.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:59.580]   In other words, making failing repetitively,
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.980]   provided we're engaged in a very specific set of behaviors
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.300]   when we do it, as well as telling ourselves
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.660]   that those failures are good for learning and good for us,
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:11.100]   creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.380]   It accelerates plasticity.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.180]   Now, some of you might be asking, and I get asked a lot,
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.580]   well, how do I get dopamine to be released?
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.340]   Can I just tell myself that something is good
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.180]   when it's bad?
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.860]   Well, actually, yes, believe it or not.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.180]   The thing about dopamine is it's highly subjective.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.500]   What's funny to one person
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.740]   is not necessarily funny to the next.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.900]   So it has to have some sense of authenticity for you.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.700]   But if you really want to be learning
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.460]   the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.900]   that should be reason enough to tell yourself,
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.700]   well, I'm frustrated,
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.540]   but the frustration is the source of accelerated learning.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.540]   Dopamine is one of these incredible molecules
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.220]   that both can be released
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:52.740]   according to things that are hardwired in us
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.640]   to release dopamine.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:57.260]   Again, things like food, sex, warmth when we're cold,
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.220]   cool environments when we're too warm.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.020]   It's that kind of pleasure molecule overall.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.220]   But it's also highly subjective
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.860]   what releases dopamine in one person versus the next.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.300]   So everyone releases dopamine
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.120]   in response to those very basic kind of behaviors
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.380]   and activities.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.340]   But dopamine is also released
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.400]   according to what we subjectively believe is good for us.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.940]   And that's what's so powerful about it.
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.500]   In fact, a book that I highly recommend
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.220]   if you want to read more about dopamine,
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.820]   it's a book that frankly, I wish I had written.
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:28.780]   It's such a wonderful book.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.620]   It's called "The Molecule of More."
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.460]   And it really talks about dopamine
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.360]   not just as a molecule associated with reward,
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.100]   but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.580]   and just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.020]   So make lots of errors.
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.420]   Tell yourself that those errors are important and good
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.940]   for your overall learning goals.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.580]   So learn to attach dopamine,
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.860]   meaning release dopamine in your brain
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.380]   when you start to make errors.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.460]   Keep the bouts of learning relatively short
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.700]   if you're an adult.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   Younger people can probably engage in more bouts of learning.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.220]   And it's probably one of the reasons
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.180]   why they learn so much faster.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.220]   They can just pack so much more information
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.580]   into the brains and nervous systems compared to adults.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.960]   You know, it's a little bit like,
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.780]   I'll use the example of a performance enhancing drugs.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.580]   You know, some of those drugs probably do enhance performance
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.500]   at the level of increasing red blood cell count, et cetera.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.460]   But a lot of what those drugs do
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.180]   is they allow athletes to recover faster
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.300]   so they can just train more.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.980]   They allow them to do more work.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.620]   And so being a child is a little bit like
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.620]   being in a performance enhanced brain milieu.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.340]   Their brains are kind of on natural,
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:40.580]   healthy neurochemicals that afford them a lot more learning
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.660]   should they pursue it.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:45.540]   So this goes back to my advice for young people early on.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.420]   If you're young, what should you do?
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.340]   Learn as much as you can about as many things
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.340]   as you possibly can.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.420]   And I suggest specializing in something,
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.300]   I guess I'm not in a position to give anyone direct advice,
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:00.740]   but I would say, hopefully by about age 30,
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.160]   hopefully younger, you have some sense of what excites you
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.200]   and try and get really good at that thing
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.100]   provided it serves the world for better.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.940]   But that's all I'll say in terms of parenting advice.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.860]   It's not my place, but maybe sometime I'll have an episode
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:21.140]   completely devoted to sort of youth and learning in youth.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.940]   But once you're attaching dopamine
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.540]   to this process of making errors,
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.320]   then I start getting lots of questions
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.620]   that really are the right questions, which are,
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.060]   you know, how often should I do this?
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.540]   And when should I be doing this?
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.380]   And at what time?
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.460]   Well, I've talked a little bit about this
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:37.460]   in previous episodes,
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.860]   but as long as we're now kind of into the nitty gritty
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.620]   of tools and application,
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.220]   each of us have some natural times throughout the day
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.660]   when we are going to be much better
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.260]   at tolerating these errors and much more focused
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.480]   on what it is that we're trying to do.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.440]   Last episode was about focus,
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.920]   but chances are that you can't focus as well at 4 p.m.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.140]   as you can at 10 a.m.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.980]   It differs for everybody depending on when you're sleeping
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.340]   and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms,
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:07.400]   but find the time or times of day
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.980]   when you naturally have the highest mental acuity.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.700]   And that's really when you wanna engage
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.340]   in these learning bouts.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.620]   And then get to the point where you're making errors
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.660]   and then keep making errors for seven to 30 minutes.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.300]   Just keep making those errors and drill through it.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.540]   And you're almost seeking frustration.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.540]   And if you can find some pleasure in the frustration,
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.280]   yes, that is a state that exists.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.340]   You have created the optimal neurochemical milieu
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.580]   for learning that thing.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.300]   But then here's the beauty of it.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.820]   You also created the optimal milieu
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.720]   for learning other things afterward.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.320]   If you leave that bout of,
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.780]   I gave the example of free throws,
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.620]   or maybe it's playing tennis or maybe it's some other skill,
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.340]   and you sit down to read a book,
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.860]   your brain is in a heightened state
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.460]   to learn and retain the information.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.580]   Because those chemicals don't get released
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   and then shut down.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.980]   You're creating a whole milieu,
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.420]   an environment of these chemicals.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:05.140]   And the tale of how long these chemicals stay
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.180]   sloshing around in your brain
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.660]   has too many factors for me to put a hard number on it.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.820]   It's gonna depend on transporters and enzymes
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.220]   and all sorts of things.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.320]   But at least for an hour or so, I would say,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.360]   you're going to be in a state of heightened learning
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.540]   and the ability to learn, not just the motor patterns,
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:24.020]   but cognitive information, language information.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.980]   Maybe you go to therapy right after that
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.180]   and you work on something in a very deliberate way
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.600]   that you're trying to work on.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.040]   Maybe you don't go to therapy,
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.380]   maybe you do something else that's important to you.
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.940]   Again, there are just a variety of examples I could give.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.380]   There are a number of things
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.180]   that allow us to powerfully access these states of error
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.860]   that are kind of surprising, but also kind of fun.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.780]   And these aren't, again, these aren't gimmicks.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.980]   These tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.060]   And the three that I'd like to talk about next
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.260]   are balance, meaning the vestibular system,
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.960]   as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.420]   or autonomic arousal.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.660]   And if none of that makes sense,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.700]   I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.740]   and what it is and why it works
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.900]   for opening up neuroplasticity.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.140]   Let's talk about limbic friction.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.940]   Now, limbic friction is not a term
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.580]   you're going to find in the textbooks.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.540]   So if any of my colleagues are listening,
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.840]   I want to repeat limbic friction.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.980]   I realize it's not something you're going to find
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.600]   in any of the textbooks.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.300]   But it is an important principle
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.260]   that captures a lot of information that is in textbooks,
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.300]   both neurobiology and psychology.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.240]   And it has some really important implications.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.660]   Limbic friction is my attempt to give a name to something
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:50.420]   that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.900]   Because typically when we hear about stress,
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.880]   we think of heart rate, heartbeat, going too fast,
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.420]   breathing too fast, sweating,
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.060]   and not being in a state that we want.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.620]   We're too alert and we want to be more calm.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.980]   And indeed, that's one condition
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.700]   in which we have limbic friction,
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.420]   meaning our limbic system is taking control
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.700]   of a number of different aspects
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.140]   of our autonomic or automatic biology.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.740]   And we are struggling to control that
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.220]   through what we call top-down mechanisms.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.760]   We're trying to calm down
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.960]   in order to reduce that level of arousal.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.980]   We're all familiar with this.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.580]   It's called the stress response.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.380]   However, there's another aspect of stress
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.260]   that's just as important,
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.900]   which is when we're tired and we're fatigued
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.700]   and we need to engage, we need to be more alert than we are.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.720]   And so what I call limbic friction
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.700]   is really designed to describe the fact
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.160]   that when our autonomic nervous system
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.280]   isn't where we want it,
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.340]   meaning we're trying to be more alert
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.180]   or we're trying to be less alert,
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.100]   both of those feel stressful to people.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.720]   So the other way to put it is that the word stress
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.440]   is not a very good word to describe
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.140]   what most people experience as stressful
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:01.220]   because it can either be being too tired or being too alert.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.620]   Now, why am I bringing this up
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.040]   in the discussion about neuroplasticity?
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.560]   This is not a discussion about stress.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.940]   At some point, we will talk about stress and tools
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.640]   to deal with stress.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.680]   But the reason I'm bringing this up
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.300]   is that in order to access neuroplasticity,
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.580]   you need these components of focus.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.560]   You need the component of attaching subjective reward.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.380]   You need to make errors, all this stuff.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.780]   And a lot of people find it difficult
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:30.180]   to just get into the overall state to access those things.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.860]   So now there's a series of gates
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.280]   that people are having a hard time accessing.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.960]   They're too tired and they can't focus, for instance.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.920]   Well, here's the beauty of it.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.420]   If you are too alert, meaning you're too anxious,
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.380]   and you want to calm down in order to learn better,
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.020]   there are things that you can do.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.580]   The two that I've spoken about previously
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.120]   on various podcasts, and I'll just review them really quickly
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.700]   are the double inhale exhale.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.060]   So inhaling twice through the nose
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.580]   and exhaling once through the mouth.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.180]   This is not some yogic trick or some hack.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.060]   This is what's called a physiological sigh.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.300]   It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.680]   It has a number of different effects.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.940]   These were described in textbooks
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.980]   and dating back to the '30s.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.740]   And a number of laboratories have explored
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.580]   the neural circuitry underlying these
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.100]   so-called physiological sighs.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   That will calm you down faster than anything else
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.920]   that I'm aware of.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.060]   The other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.100]   When you use tunnel vision, you're very focused.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:30.020]   That epinephrine is released by dilating your field of gaze,
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.100]   so-called panoramic vision.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.940]   Great.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.540]   So now you can start to sort of move up and down
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.140]   this level of autonomic arousal.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.620]   The key is you want to be in a state of arousal
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.080]   that's ideally matched to the thing
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.460]   that you're trying to perform or learn.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.100]   So if I'm really anxious
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.980]   and I can't even pick up the basketball
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.260]   or I feel like I'm shaking or my muscles are too tight,
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.720]   I don't have that kind of looseness.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.860]   Now when I move like that,
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.520]   almost makes it look like I could throw a free throw,
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.380]   but I miss 95% of the time,
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.160]   unless the basket is very, very low
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.500]   and I place it indirectly,
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.100]   but I guess that's not a free throw, is it?
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.920]   In any case, the point being
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.380]   that you want to be in a state of alertness, but calm.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.380]   And so you need to have ways to calm yourself down
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   when you're too amped up.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.540]   But the other side of limbic friction is important too.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.620]   If you are too tired and you can't focus,
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.960]   well, then it's going to be impossible
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.320]   to even get to the starting line,
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.700]   so to speak, for engaging in neuroplasticity
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.500]   through incremental learning, et cetera.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.900]   So in that case,
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.180]   there are other methods that you can do to wake yourself up.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.020]   The best thing you should do is get a good night's sleep,
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.180]   but that's not always possible,
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.860]   or use a NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.340]   But if you've already done those things
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.160]   or you're simply exhausted for whatever other reason,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.540]   then there are other things that I often get asked about,
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.500]   like sure, a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing,
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   which means inhaling more than exhaling
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.460]   on average in a breathing bout.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.980]   These are, now we're sort of getting toward the realm
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.460]   of like how you could trick your nervous system
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.320]   into waking up.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.920]   And if you bring more oxygen in
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.520]   by making your inhales deeper and longer,
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.180]   you will become more alert.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.240]   You'll start to actually deploy norepinephrine
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.660]   if you breathe very fast.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.520]   So there are things that you can do to move up or down
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.580]   this so-called autonomic arousal arc.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.980]   And what you want to ask before you undergo
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.140]   any learning bout is how much limbic friction
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.080]   am I experiencing?
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.780]   Am I too alert and I want to be calmer?
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.960]   Or am I too calm and too sleepy and I want to be more alert?
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.940]   You're going to need to engage in behaviors
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.920]   that bring you to the starting line in order to learn.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.000]   There are other things that you can do
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.440]   in order to then learn better and faster
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.780]   besides incremental learning,
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.820]   and those center on the vestibular system.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.840]   And this may come as a surprise to some people,
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.380]   but probably not as a surprise to some of you
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.000]   whose professions or whose recreation
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.380]   involves a lot of motor activity
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.760]   and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity,
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.620]   not just running or cycling or very linear activities
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.960]   like weightlifting, but things that involve inversions
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.300]   and a lot of lateral movement, actual sports,
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.540]   jumping, diving, rolling, these kinds of things,
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.660]   gymnastics type stuff.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.340]   Why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity?
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.820]   Well, we have a hardwired system for balance
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.420]   and here's how it works in as simple terms
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.980]   as I can possibly come up with.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   As we move through space, or even if we're stationary,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.920]   there are really three main planes of movement.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.560]   Now I realize some people are just listening to this,
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.160]   so I'm going to do this for both of the folks
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.080]   that are just listening
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.200]   and for those of you that are watching on video.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.100]   So there are three main modes of movement
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.380]   and it turns out that your brain doesn't really know
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.260]   where your body is except through
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.100]   that proprioceptive feedback.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:49.160]   The main way it knows is through three planes of movement
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.840]   that we call pitch, which is like nodding.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.740]   So if I nod like this, that's pitch.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:57.400]   Then there's yaw, which is side to side,
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.600]   which is like shaking my head, no.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.660]   And then there's roll from side to side,
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.640]   like when a puppy looks at you like that kind of thing.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.480]   So pitch, yaw, and roll.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.260]   And the pilots out there will know exactly
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.420]   what I'm talking about.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.440]   The brain knows the orientation and position of your body
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.180]   relative to gravity, depending on whether or not
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.120]   your brain and your head actually is engaging more in pitch,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   yaw, or roll, or some combination.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.000]   Because if I lean down like so,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.160]   or like so, it's a combination of pitch, yaw, and roll.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.980]   Now you might say like, what is going on here?
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.920]   Well, we have these little things in our inner ear
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.580]   called the semicircular canals.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.640]   Just like our eyes have two main functions,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.440]   one is to see objects in space
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.800]   and the other is to set our circadian clocks
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.080]   through subconscious mechanisms.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.000]   Our ears have two main roles.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.720]   One is to hear, right?
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.120]   To perceive sound waves
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.160]   or take in sound waves for perception, so-called hearing.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.580]   And the other is balance or vestibular function.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.160]   So sitting in our ears are these semicircular canals.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   And they're these little tubes where these little stones,
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.520]   they're actually little bits of calcium,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.440]   roll back and forth like little marbles.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.520]   When we roll this way, they roll this way.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.520]   When we pitch, when we go from side to side,
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.020]   there's some that sit flat like this and they go like marbles
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.120]   inside of a hula hoop, and then we have roll.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.240]   There's some that are kind of at 45 degrees to those
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.400]   and it's kind of pitch, yaw, and roll.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.700]   So you go, okay, great.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.260]   That sends signals to the rest of our brain and body
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.040]   that tell us how to compensate
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.720]   for shifts relative to gravity.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.700]   And I say, okay, I thought we were talking about plasticity,
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.160]   but this is where it gets really, really cool.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.160]   Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience,
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.840]   meaning when we are off balance
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.800]   and we have to compensate by looking at, thinking about,
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.460]   or responding to the world differently,
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.100]   cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.420]   It actually means mini brain.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.980]   It looks like a little mini brain stuck,
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.360]   like tucked below our cortex in the back.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.340]   Caused the cerebellum to signal
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.420]   some of these deeper brain centers
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.740]   that release dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:08.740]   And that's because these circuits in the inner ear,
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.100]   et cetera, and the cerebellum,
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.880]   they were designed to recalibrate our motor movements
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.580]   when our relationship to gravity changes,
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.000]   something fundamental to survival.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.900]   We can't afford to be falling down all the time
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.160]   or missing things that we grab for,
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.420]   or running in the wrong direction
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.940]   when something is pursuing us.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.480]   These are hardwired circuits
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.620]   that tap right into these chemical pathways.
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   And those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.800]   So I really want to spell this out clearly
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.280]   cause I've given a lot of information today.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.160]   The first thing is how are you arriving
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.040]   to the learning bout?
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.380]   You need to make sure your level
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.060]   of autonomic arousal is correct.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.100]   The ideal state is going to be clear, calm, and focused,
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.620]   maybe a little bit more on the arousal level,
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.300]   like heightened arousal.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.080]   So understand limbic friction,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.420]   understand that you can be too tired,
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.340]   in which case you're going to need
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.900]   to get yourself a little more alert,
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.460]   or you can be too alert
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.220]   and you're going to need to get yourself calmer.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220]   That gets you to the starting line.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.460]   When you're at the starting line,
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.920]   then you're going to go into a learning bout
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.820]   and that's when you want to start making these errors, okay?
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.140]   But what I'm saying is there's a layer in between
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.800]   where if you are interested in using motor patterns
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.420]   as a way to open up plasticity for all kinds of learning,
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.660]   not just motor learning,
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:34.900]   disrupting your vestibular motor relationship,
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.860]   meaning, and I'll tell you how to do that in a moment,
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.280]   can deploy or release neurochemicals in the brain
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.460]   that place you into a state
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.980]   that makes you much better at learning
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.400]   and making errors much more pleasureful.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.220]   You're much more willing to do that.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.500]   Now, some of you are probably saying flow state, flow state.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.100]   Okay, I have friends that work on flow states
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.920]   and who are involved in flow states
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.300]   and trying to figure out what they are.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.820]   I have great respect for those people.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.820]   So I want to tip my hat to them, very important work,
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.980]   but again, flow is an expression
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.260]   of what you already know how to do.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.940]   It's not how you learn,
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.580]   it's how you express what you've already learned.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.160]   So I want to be really clear about that.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.980]   It's been kind of presented as this super state
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.660]   or highly desirable state,
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.340]   but it's that we can all reach for.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.200]   That's the wrong rung to reach for
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.820]   until you already know how to do the things
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.920]   that I'm describing in my opinion.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.040]   So the vestibular system,
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040]   if you can engage the vestibular system
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.700]   and create some errors within the vestibular motor operations
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.840]   that you're carrying out,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.400]   you create a neurochemical state
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.880]   that then makes you very, very good
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.840]   at learning very quickly, regardless of age.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.080]   So what would this look like?
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.840]   Does this mean just doing inversions?
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.960]   Well, does this mean doing yoga?
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.800]   Maybe.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.620]   Does this mean taking corners faster on your road bike?
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.160]   Does this mean, let's say you always swim freestyle
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.000]   or breaststroke?
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.980]   Does this mean swimming backstroke or butterfly?
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.280]   It depends.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.580]   It depends, however, on a very, very easy
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.720]   to understand parameter,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.020]   which is how regularly you perform
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:18.780]   a particular motor behavior and how novel a behavior is.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.340]   So the more novel that a behavior is
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.880]   in terms of your relationship to gravity,
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.540]   the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.560]   Have you ever seen somebody
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.520]   who just jumped out of the plane for the first time
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.020]   with a parachute?
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.020]   I don't even want to think about what,
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.760]   if you've just seen somebody who jumped out of a plane
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.020]   for the first time without a parachute,
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.200]   I would just hope the plane was on the ground.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.100]   But if you've seen somebody after that,
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.740]   they are in this incredible state
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.080]   because their body and brain are flooded
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.400]   with all these neurochemicals
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.040]   because it's very novel to them.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.180]   However, I've got friends from communities
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.840]   that have done thousands upon thousands,
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.400]   maybe tens of thousands of jumps,
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.280]   and they're always alert and aware,
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.320]   but it becomes pretty regular for them.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.200]   That's the point.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.140]   And they're not in this kind of buzzed out,
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.500]   excited state afterwards because it's routine for them.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.000]   So the key is to bring novelty
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.440]   to the vestibular motor experience,
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   the vestibular motor commands that you're performing.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.900]   And how do you do that?
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.640]   Well, it's all about your orientation relative to gravity.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.720]   Now, I wouldn't want anyone to place themselves at risk.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.920]   So if you can't do handstands,
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.440]   don't try and do them,
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.800]   freestanding and whatever.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.000]   If you're good at handstands,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.160]   guess how much plasticity doing a handstands
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.820]   for half an hour is going to create for you?
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   Zero, zero.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.600]   Your body is fully comfortable walking on your hands.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.560]   I see these people walking on your hands,
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.120]   being upside down, being inverted.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.640]   You know, your Cirque du Soleil performers,
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.780]   they're very comfortable there.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.320]   And there's zero learning, zero plasticity
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.960]   because the failures and errors
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.380]   and the relationship to gravity
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.840]   are very typical for that individual.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.560]   Now, what this means is
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.640]   that if we're going to use motor practices
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.520]   to open up plasticity for learning,
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.700]   not just those practices,
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.160]   but maybe some cognitive skills
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.600]   or other things in the period that follows,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.680]   we need to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.400]   And that means being either in a new position
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.320]   or slightly unstable.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.280]   Believe it or not, I don't want anyone injuring themselves,
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.960]   but the sensation of falling or close to falling
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.940]   signals the cerebellum to signal the deep brain centers
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.780]   that release these neurochemicals,
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.120]   that something is very different
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.080]   and we need to correct this error very, very fast.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.600]   Earlier, I was talking about high contingencies for learning
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.020]   and you know, you definitely don't want to make it
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.480]   a kind of like either survive this
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.880]   or die kind of experience.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.300]   I confess I occasionally look at these parkour videos
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.360]   on YouTube and believe it or not,
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.280]   a lot of those people have died.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.720]   The ones that do these ridiculous things
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.200]   of hanging off of buildings and things,
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.880]   I am not suggesting you do that, please don't do that.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.840]   What I'm talking about is finding safe ways
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.560]   to explore the sensory motor vestibular space as we call it,
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.040]   the relationship between those things.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.480]   So that could be through yoga.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.600]   If you're terrible at yoga,
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.020]   there's more opportunity for you to learn
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.440]   than somebody who's very skilled at yoga, for instance,
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.280]   or gymnastics or handstands or on your road bike.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.040]   This is unfortunately what I don't want to name brands,
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.560]   but stationary bikes where they give you
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.600]   the visual experience of moving through space,
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.740]   but you're not actually moving through physical space.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:25.540]   There's no vestibular feedback, it's all visual, right?
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.620]   You're stationary on the bike, right?
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.760]   So unless you're hanging off the bike in your living room,
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.020]   like almost to the point you're tipping the bike,
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:35.160]   you're not getting the actual vestibular motor
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.080]   sensory mismatch, that mismatch is the signal
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.440]   that deploys dopamine epinephrine and these other things.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.880]   I don't care how excited or how much fun the ride was
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.160]   or how much music you're playing that you love,
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.740]   it's not the same situation as being
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.740]   out of your normal relationship to the gravitational pull.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.320]   So the first gate is to arrive at learning
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.620]   at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal.
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.280]   Clear and focused is best,
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.460]   but don't obsess over being right there.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.680]   It's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.700]   Then you want to make errors, we talked about that,
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.600]   and this vestibular motor sensory relationship
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.040]   is absolutely key if you want to get heightened
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.840]   or accelerated plasticity.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.380]   And we talked about another feature,
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.400]   which is setting a contingency.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.160]   If there's a reason, an important reason for you
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.860]   to actually learn, even if you're making failures,
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.680]   the learning will be accelerated.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.040]   So there's really four things that you really need to do
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.020]   for plasticity as an adult.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:39.680]   And I would say that these also apply to young people.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   And there's an interesting kind of thought experiment there
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.820]   as well, which is if you look at children,
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:49.840]   they are moving a lot in different dimensions.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.400]   They are sometimes hanging from trees,
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.280]   or I was a kind of a, my sports were always things
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.240]   where I tended to get hurt a lot, fall a lot,
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.120]   so it was skateboarding for me when I was younger,
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.760]   so a lot of falling and rolling
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.040]   and various things of that sort.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.760]   But whatever sport the kids are playing,
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.760]   or even if they don't play a sport,
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.880]   they tend to move in a lot of different relationships
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.040]   to gravity, more dimensionality to their movements,
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.480]   I should say, than adults.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.480]   And one of the questions that's always kind of been
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.460]   in the back of my mind is, you know, as we age,
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.880]   we get less good at engaging in neuroplasticity.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.540]   Part of that is because as the brain ages,
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.780]   there are certain changes to the way
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.920]   that neurons are structured,
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.920]   the molecular components, et cetera,
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:35.440]   but it's kind of a self-amplifying,
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   or I should say a self-degenerating cycle,
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:46.720]   where as we get older, we tend to get more linear
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.220]   and more regular about specific kinds of movements.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.400]   So we get on the treadmill, or we take the walk,
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.560]   or we just always go up the same stairs, et cetera,
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.500]   and there's less opportunity typically
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:00.300]   for engaging these relationships to the gravitational pull
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.160]   through the vestibular motor sensory convergence
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.040]   that we talked about a moment ago.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.760]   And so you sort of have to wonder
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.560]   whether or not the lack of plasticity
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.960]   or the reduced plasticity in older individuals,
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.320]   which includes me, would reflect the fact
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.280]   that those chemicals aren't being deployed
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.740]   because we're not engaging in certain behaviors,
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.200]   as opposed to we can't engage in the behaviors
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.040]   because the chemicals aren't being deployed.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.260]   Now, I have a feeling it's both.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.240]   These have a reciprocal relationship.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.840]   And I certainly, again, I don't think it would be wise
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.200]   for anyone who doesn't have the muscle stabilizing skills
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.600]   or the bone density, et cetera,
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.160]   to start doing inversions and things of that sort.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160]   That's not what I'm talking about here.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.960]   But it's interesting to think about the sorts of exercise
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.800]   that we engage in.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.400]   We all know that getting the heart rate elevated
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.940]   three to five times a week is really good for us,
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.160]   for cardiovascular health.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.780]   I think there's a ton of data to support that now.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.260]   Some load-bearing exercise is important
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.520]   for increasing bone density
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.840]   and maintaining muscular strength
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.000]   and proprioceptive feedback,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.280]   because I'm sure many of you know this,
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.280]   but resistance exercise
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.140]   actually trains the nerve to muscle connections
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.640]   as much as it does the muscles themselves,
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.160]   something I talked about at the beginning of the episode.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.160]   But I think most of us could stand to increase the degree
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.880]   to which we engage this vestibular system in novel ways.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.320]   And that can be done quite safely
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.200]   through a number of different mechanisms.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.920]   I'm not a surfer, but people who do that sort of thing
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.400]   are very familiar with orienting their body differently
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.480]   according to the gravitational pull,
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.040]   where they're lying down, then they're standing up,
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.840]   then they're turning, they're leaning their head.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.400]   So again, it's this pitchy all roll thing.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.640]   And again, if you're very skilled at surfing,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.820]   you're actually not going to open up plasticity
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.660]   just by surfing.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.700]   It's in the learning of these new relationships to gravity
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.780]   that the windows for plasticity are enhanced.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.480]   So I want to make sure that I underscore the fact
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.040]   that this vestibular thing that I've been describing
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.400]   is a way to really accentuate plasticity.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.240]   It's tapping into an inborn biological mechanism
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.660]   where the cerebellum has outputs
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.840]   to these deep brain nuclei associated with dopamine,
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.560]   acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.020]   You don't want to endanger yourself
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.940]   in the course of pursuing these activities,
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.820]   but it is a powerful mechanism.
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:23.080]   That's kind of an amplifier on plasticity,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.440]   as is high contingency.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.540]   If you really need to learn conversational French
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.520]   to save your relationship,
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.840]   chances are you're going to learn it.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.900]   There are limits, of course,
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.640]   to the extent to which one can accentuate
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.680]   or accelerate plasticity.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.840]   You know, the ceiling on this is not infinite.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.020]   Although we don't know how high it goes,
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.300]   I think it's reasonable to say that
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.820]   if someone put a gun to my head and said,
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.960]   learn conversational French in the next 120 seconds,
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.840]   that conversational French would be limited
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.280]   probably to just one word,
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.640]   probably the word we or something like that,
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.400]   because I can't stuff in all the knowledge all at once.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.800]   I mean, I think that's the dream of brain machine interface
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.580]   that one will be able to download a chip
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.760]   into their hippocampus or cortex
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.860]   or some other brain structure
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:06.040]   that would allow them to download conversational French.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.940]   And someday we may get to that
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.040]   as that capability may come about.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.080]   Right now, it does not exist,
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.760]   nor is there a specific pill or chemical
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.040]   that will allow you to download
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.480]   more information more quickly.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.760]   This is the issue around nootropics I've talked about before.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.720]   There are things that can increase focus,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.660]   mainly things that increase acetylcholine
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.120]   and transmission through the nicotine system,
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.560]   things that can increase dopamine,
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.360]   things like L-tyrosine.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.560]   Again, I'm not recommending these,
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.340]   you need to heed the warnings on those bottles,
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.920]   but they will increase these neurochemicals.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.280]   And there are of course things
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.200]   that will increase epinephrine,
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.200]   things like caffeine,
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.200]   or some people because of prescription take Adderall.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.800]   I'm again not suggesting people take any of these things.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.340]   In fact, today I focused almost exclusively
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:57.980]   on behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.320]   that will allow you to access more plasticity
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.640]   regardless of age.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.360]   And they center around things that I'm sure
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.680]   if you look around you, you'll see evidence for,
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.400]   oh, incremental learning is powerful,
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.980]   or, oh, the vestibular system
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.960]   can open up opportunities for plasticity.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.880]   I'm sure that the yogis out there are all saying,
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.420]   wait, this sounds exactly like yoga.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.840]   We're supposed to push to an edge and do these inversions
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.060]   and do all those sorts of things.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:23.940]   Well, I want to be clear.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.560]   I never said anyone should do inversions.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.160]   I said that the vestibular system is a valuable portal
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.640]   into some of these neurochemical states
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.120]   that favor plasticity.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.120]   But not so seldom I hear from the yoga community
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.560]   and they will say things like,
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.660]   much of what you're saying about how the brain works
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.480]   or neuroplasticity has already been described
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.280]   or is embedded in yoga practices.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.420]   And I just want to be very clear.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.600]   I have tremendous respect for the yoga community
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.680]   and the practices.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.040]   I've done yoga from time to time.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.900]   I find it challenging and valuable.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.900]   I'm not a regular practitioner.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.980]   But the problem with yoga
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.840]   is exactly the same problem with science,
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.740]   which is that yoga has a lot of practices
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.300]   for which there are very specific names,
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.680]   but no description or lending of understanding
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.140]   about mechanism.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:16.240]   And science has a lot of mechanisms
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.760]   and a lot of publications and papers
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.200]   for which there's very little,
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.240]   if not no description of tools and practices.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.220]   So my goal in not just today,
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:28.640]   but in many ways throughout the course of the podcast
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.080]   is to bridge the gaps between these various disciplines
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.320]   in ways that are grounded mainly
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.760]   to the fields of neuroscience and some related fields.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.320]   So yes, it's true that I look at things
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.900]   mainly through the lens of science,
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.260]   but that's not to say
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.120]   that it exhaustively explains everything about anything,
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.180]   nor is it to say that it's the only lens
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.480]   through which one could look at
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.180]   something like neuroplasticity.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.680]   So I just want to acknowledge that I have great respect
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.760]   for all these different practices and communities.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.880]   And I think that indeed,
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.640]   there are many cases in which different communities
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.920]   and practices have been aimed at
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.320]   targeting the same goals or outcomes.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.040]   Science and neuroscience
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.240]   through an understanding of mechanism
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.160]   can allow all of us
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.440]   to gain a kind of common understanding
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.800]   about what those practices are
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.000]   and how to access things like neuroplasticity,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.860]   sleep, et cetera.
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.500]   And I do believe, as I've said previously on this podcast,
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.680]   that understanding mechanism affords us
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.080]   a certain flexibility,
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.040]   and I don't mean physical flexibility.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.280]   I mean a flexibility when we can't engage
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.340]   in a particular behavior.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.260]   Maybe we're injured,
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.040]   or maybe we're not in the right situation
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.720]   to do a particular practice.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.600]   But by thinking about mechanism,
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.040]   we can adapt our circumstances.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.920]   I've talked about this with sleep.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.320]   If you're rigidly attached to one protocol
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.480]   of always looking at sunlight
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.960]   at one particular time in the morning and in the evening,
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.960]   that is not as valuable as understanding the mechanisms
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.920]   of why you might look at sunlight
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.800]   at one particular time versus another,
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.640]   because that affords you a flexibility,
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   allows you to adapt.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.400]   And life is very dynamic,
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.780]   and we don't have control
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:06.560]   over all the external conditions all the time.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.360]   And so understanding mechanism
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.520]   through the lens of neuroscience,
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.480]   I do believe can be very powerful
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.120]   because of course there are multiple ways
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.640]   to access dopamine.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.080]   There are multiple ways to adjust limbic friction.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.240]   It's not just through respiration.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.880]   Of course, there are many ways to do that.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.080]   And so my overall goal here in this episode
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.720]   and with this podcast is to give you
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.680]   some understanding of the mechanisms
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.100]   and the insights into the underlying biology
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.960]   that allow you to tailor
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.080]   what these kind of foundational mechanisms are
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.760]   to suit your particular learning needs.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.000]   So I really thank you for your time and attention today.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.480]   I've covered a lot of material.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.000]   I very much encourage questions in the comment section
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.840]   if you're looking at this on YouTube.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.720]   And if you're not and you're listening to it
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.080]   on Apple or Spotify,
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.780]   please feel free to visit us over on the YouTube channel
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.700]   and put your questions in the comment section.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.600]   I do read them.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.800]   This entire month is all about neuroplasticity.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.160]   There's a lot to cover,
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.600]   but I'm very excited to delve deeper into this topic
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.080]   as it relates to your particular interests.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.560]   Many of you have graciously asked
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.700]   how you can help support the podcast.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:15.040]   The best way you can do that is to subscribe
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.700]   to the YouTube channel if you haven't done that already,
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.680]   as well as to place questions in the comment section below
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.160]   or comments if you'd like to give us feedback.

[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.760]   And Apple allows you to leave a five-star review
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.120]   if you believe we deserve a five-star review
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.020]   as well as leave comments about the podcast.
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.960]   In addition, if you can suggest the podcast
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.880]   to your friends, to your family members,
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.300]   or anyone that you think might be able to use
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.660]   and appreciate the information,
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.480]   that's a terrific way to support us.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.360]   And of course, check out our sponsors
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.580]   that we mentioned at the beginning.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.160]   That's a terrific way to support us as well.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.080]   Several times throughout today's episode,
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.780]   as well as on previous episodes of the podcast,
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.680]   I've talked about various supplements
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.640]   that can be useful for enhancing sleep,
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.160]   enhancing neuroplasticity, et cetera.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.680]   And again, I want to emphasize
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.160]   that I always think that behavioral practices
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.720]   are the place to start.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.360]   I don't think supplements should ever be
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.580]   the first line of entry for people looking
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.340]   to enhance these aspects of their nervous system in life.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.680]   But for those of you that are interested in supplements
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.260]   and the supplements that I take,
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.600]   I'm pleased to announce that we partnered with Thorne,
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.900]   T-H-O-R-N-E.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.160]   And Thorne makes supplements that are, in my opinion,
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.720]   of the very highest stringency
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.260]   in terms of what's listed on the bottle
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.940]   is actually what you'll find in the bottle.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.360]   This is a serious issue for the supplement industry,
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.420]   as well as just the overall quality
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.960]   of the materials they put into their supplements.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.680]   If you'd like to take a look at the supplements that I take,
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.360]   as well as explore any of them for yourself,
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.360]   you can go to Thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.480]   And if you look there,
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.920]   you'll see a number of the different supplements that I take.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.920]   And if you decide to purchase any of them,
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.600]   you'll get 20% off your order.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.560]   So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E/u/huberman
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.940]   to see the supplements that I take
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.540]   and to explore if any of them are right for you.
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.160]   In the next episode of this podcast,
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.340]   we're going to continue to explore neuroplasticity.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.440]   This, as you may recall,
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.040]   is the way that we go about things
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.420]   here at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.280]   which is to really drill deeply into a topic
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.940]   for three or four or even five episodes
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:24.120]   so that by the end of those episodes,
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.220]   all of you have a very firm understanding
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:28.940]   of how to apply the principles of neurobiology
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.540]   to the specific practices and endeavors
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.280]   that are most important to you.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.120]   So I very much thank you for your time and attention.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.000]   I know it's a lot of information
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.440]   and it takes a bit of focus and attention
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.160]   and certainly will trigger plasticity
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.960]   to learn all this information.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.480]   I want to encourage you and just remind you
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.940]   that you don't have to grasp it all at once,
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:51.580]   that it is here archived,
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.440]   and that if you want to return to the information,
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.880]   it will still be here.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.040]   And that I most of all really appreciate
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.360]   your interest in science.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.200]   Thank you so much.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.780]   [upbeat music]
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.360]   (upbeat music)
