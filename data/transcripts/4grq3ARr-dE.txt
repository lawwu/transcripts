[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Happy Friday everyone, welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, as many of you can imagine,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.400]   when one spouse gets saved and the other spouse does not,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.280]   it leads to new tensions inside of the home.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.600]   Maybe you don't need to imagine such tensions,
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.080]   maybe this is your reality.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.840]   At least five times we have addressed these tensions
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.280]   on the podcast in the past.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280]   You can see APJs 397, 680, 1029, 1560, and 1690.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.320]   And this now includes today's episode, 1839.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.880]   It's a question from a woman who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.480]   Here's her question.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.220]   Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.360]   Although I have always identified as a Christian,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.660]   I just recently experienced the new birth
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.740]   as a married woman with children at age 34.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.740]   Praise God, that's awesome to hear.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.720]   My husband, however, is not a Christian.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.480]   Jesus has transformed my life.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.020]   And although my husband has been supportive of me until now,
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.560]   he does not want me to be baptized.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.280]   I feel the time has come for me to be baptized,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.120]   but I don't wanna go against
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.800]   my husband's expressed wishes either.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   Ephesians 5, 22 to 24 says I should submit to my husband.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.440]   First Peter 3, 1 speaks of the influence
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.100]   of a wife's conduct on her non-believing husband.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.200]   But I am called by Jesus to be baptized.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   So should I go against my husband's wishes here?
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.780]   When all is said and done,
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.380]   my bottom line answer is going to be yes.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.040]   But for that act to be pleasing to the Lord,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920]   there is more that needs to be said.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.320]   So let's take a few minutes and think about this.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.700]   The uniform teaching of the New Testament,
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.000]   whether it's Ephesians 5 or 1 Corinthians 11
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.140]   or Colossians 3 or 1 Peter 3,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.600]   the uniform teaching is that husbands
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.880]   are to be the head of their wives
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.080]   the way Christ is the head of the church,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   and that wives should be in glad support of that leadership,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.160]   that headship, which the New Testament calls submission.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.060]   So I would define submission like this,
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.700]   the disposition of a wife's heart and mind
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.480]   for the sake of Christ to give glad support
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540]   to her husband's leadership.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.540]   And the reason I use that kind of definition,
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.500]   namely a disposition of heart and mind
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.660]   to comply gladly with the husband's initiatives
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.620]   and leadership for the Lord's sake,
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.940]   is that those two aspects of the definition,
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.800]   the disposition and for the Lord's sake,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   provide limitations on the absoluteness
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.120]   of obedience to the husband.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720]   So the first limitation is implied in the words,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.080]   a disposition of heart and mind,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.940]   because you can have a disposition to comply
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.260]   even if sometimes for godly biblical reasons,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.340]   you may not comply.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.940]   In other words, there is a huge difference
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.860]   between a biblically submissive wife
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.680]   who occasionally sees biblical reasons
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.540]   not to comply with something her husband expects,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.340]   and a defiant wife or a just an egalitarian wife
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.660]   who is resistant to the very notion
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.240]   that her husband has a God-given responsibility
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.620]   to exercise initiative and authority in their relationship.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.940]   There's a big difference.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.600]   And the other limitation that my definition puts
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.420]   on absolute obedience to the husband is
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.460]   when it says that her glad support
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.980]   for the husband's leadership is for the Lord's sake,
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.660]   that's really significant.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   What I mean by that is that she is first and foremost
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.780]   under the Lordship of Christ as a Christian.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.060]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.460]   And then derivatively, not absolutely,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.900]   under the leadership of her husband.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   So Paul says in Colossians 3, 18,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.320]   wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.020]   And Ephesians 5, 22 says,
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.260]   wives submit to your own husbands as to the Lord.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.460]   Now, both of which, both of those statements
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.540]   that connect submission with the Lord
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.100]   imply that submission to the husband
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.220]   is flowing from a prior reality
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.740]   that's higher and more authoritative,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.740]   namely being in the Lord or having Jesus as your Lord.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.700]   Then Peter makes this connection most clear
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.900]   when he begins his section on submission to state,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   masters, husbands, in chapter two, verse 13 of 1 Peter,
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.500]   he says, "Be subject for the Lord's sake
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   "to every human institution."
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.620]   Now that's huge.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.620]   All obedience to humans is subordinated
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.820]   to obedience to Jesus, the absolute Lord.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.660]   We do things for his sake in submission to him
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.940]   under his Lordship.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.940]   Obedience to Jesus sends us into earthly relationships
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.460]   with the disposition to serve
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.560]   and acknowledge God-given authority,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.500]   but that same obedience to Jesus limits our obedience
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.820]   because Jesus does not send us
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.620]   to be obediently disobedient to him.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.540]   The words of Peter in Acts 5.29 fly like a banner
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.580]   over all Christian relationships.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.520]   We must obey God rather than men, they said.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.540]   So now, in regard to the decision of this wife
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.540]   to be baptized while her husband disapproves,
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.080]   here are several implications I would draw out.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.420]   First, when it comes to the command of Christ,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.900]   versus the command of a husband,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.540]   the command of Christ will take precedence
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.780]   over the command of the husband when they're in conflict,
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.840]   as they are here, it seems.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.300]   This is what it means to have Jesus as your Lord.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.420]   Baptism is a command of the Lord Jesus.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.660]   In the Great Commission, Matthew 28, 19 to 20,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.100]   he said that making disciples of all nations
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.540]   included baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.100]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.820]   Baptism never became merely optional
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.060]   in the ministry of the apostles.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.300]   There's no evidence of any Christians in the early church
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.220]   who were not baptized.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.940]   The assumption in all the epistles
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.340]   is that Christians have been baptized.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.700]   It belongs together with faith as an outward expression
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.300]   of our death with Christ and our resurrection in him
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.660]   to newness of life.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   So that's the first thing.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.980]   Second, choosing to be baptized
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.820]   against the desire of a husband
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.260]   does not mean that a wife has abandoned
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.940]   her disposition of heart and mind
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   to give glad support to her husband's leadership.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.540]   This exceptional act of noncompliance
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.540]   can be pursued without defiance and without anger
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.020]   and with respect and affection
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020]   and with an expressed longing, expressed to her husband,
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.020]   that he would see in her a loyal wife
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.180]   who delights to be responsive
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.540]   to his initiatives and leadership,
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.820]   but on this particular point,
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.380]   her greater allegiance is to Jesus
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.780]   and his call to be baptized.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.540]   Third, I would emphasize that she doesn't need
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.220]   to be precipitous or hasty in her action,
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.620]   but for her husband's sake and for peace and hope,
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.820]   she can go slow, it seems like she has,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   and pray and seek to help him understand
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.540]   as much as he'll let her.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.860]   She does not need to give any impression
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.340]   that she's acting rashly,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.180]   but that she has come to this decision carefully,
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.940]   thoughtfully, and would love to include him
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.340]   in the process, indeed, have him be a part
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.900]   of the event as well.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.020]   And finally, number four, by way of encouragement,
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.500]   even though this is a point of tension
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.100]   between her and her husband,
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.100]   it may turn out that by the conversations they have
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.420]   about the meaning of what she's doing
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.580]   and why she's doing it,
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.820]   that this would be one of the most clarifying things
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.340]   for him about the very meaning of Christianity.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.300]   What does it mean that his wife is a Christian?
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.700]   It may be that some of his resistance to baptism
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.980]   is owing to a very superficial understanding
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.860]   of what it is and what it really means to be a Christian.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.380]   And this decision on her part may give her an opportunity
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   to explain to him the profound reality
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.500]   of spiritual death with Christ
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.860]   and new life in the spirit
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.380]   and all the implications of what it is
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.500]   to be forgiven and accepted and loved
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.300]   and indwelt by the Holy Spirit
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.260]   with the hope of everlasting life.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.260]   Few things will provide as clear an opportunity
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260]   for a wife to make plain to an unbelieving husband
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.580]   what it means for her to be a Christian
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.540]   as for her to explain in great detail, perhaps,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.020]   what the greatness of baptism stands for.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.020]   So I will pray that God give you great grace
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.300]   and wisdom as you move forward
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.180]   and that your husband will not only be agreeable
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.220]   but someday join you in the life
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.100]   that baptism really stands for.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.580]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.220]   The tensions of marriages where Christians
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.180]   are married to non-Christians, again,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.540]   is something we've addressed in APJ episodes in the past.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.540]   You can find those in APJs 397, 680, 1029, 1560, and 1690.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:25.060]   You can find all those episodes at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.060]   Episode 397, 680, 1029, 1560, and 1690.
