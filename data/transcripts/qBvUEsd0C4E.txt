[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.320]   All right.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.040]   What do we have here?
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   A question from Adnan.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.960]   He says, does writing on digital paper, in your opinion,
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.360]   really have any advantage over conventional paper writing?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.520]   And he points in particular to a product
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.240]   that I've heard a lot about called Remarkable.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   I guess they're now up to the Remarkable 2.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.440]   I'll tell you, I have not yet tried Remarkable.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040]   It is very alluring.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.660]   And I don't know if that's just branding
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.400]   or if it's actually useful.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.120]   Because it's a cool thing.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.080]   It's like a tablet.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.360]   And it uses an e-ink technology like a Kindle.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.280]   So it's not a screen.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.360]   It's not a backlit screen.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.500]   It's actually-- if you don't know how e-ink works,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.800]   there's actually these teeny little disks
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.880]   that are black on one side and gray on another.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.840]   And with an electrical impulse, you
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.300]   can switch it from one to another.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.120]   So it's literally making a non-illuminated, just
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.040]   an actual physical picture that you're looking at.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.240]   There's no light involved.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   This Remarkable tablet, you can write on it.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   So it sort of follows your special pencil.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560]   So you're writing on it.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.200]   And then it can save the pages.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.400]   And you can go back to them.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.160]   So it's like a notebook, except for it's all stored digitally.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.740]   It's not actually a physical notebook.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.840]   Anyways, it's a cool-looking product.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.680]   I like Jesse's note.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.520]   I think this tells you why it's so appealing.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.600]   His note about the promotional video
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   is really good-looking people in rich places writing stuff.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.880]   It's good branding.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.080]   I mean, it was a great video.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.800]   And it's-- yeah, it's what it shows.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   It's true, though.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   I've seen this video.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280]   And I'm like, A, I got to go to Monaco.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   Like, B, I probably need to dress better.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.800]   And C, I need to be looking out over the bay.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   Yeah, in your mansion.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.960]   And yeah, writing.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.400]   Like, I don't know what.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.960]   Poetry or something.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   So I don't-- Adnan, if you use one, report back.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880]   This branding hits me like an arrow.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.800]   And I'm like, I really need one of these things.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.560]   I suspect that--
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.880]   let me show you.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.440]   This probably solves the same problem, because it's analog.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.760]   It's very easy to get to the pages you already wrote,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.180]   because you can just flip to them.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.360]   It doesn't require batteries.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.760]   But I see that ad, and I want it to.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.920]   So I don't know.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   Try it.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.560]   If any of my listeners out there have tried this
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.480]   and have a compelling use case for one of these e-ink
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.800]   notebooks like Remarkable, send me a note
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.040]   or send Jesse a note at jesse@calnewport.com,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.080]   because we're curious.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.960]   Maybe it'll make us rich.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.440]   Is that how it works?
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.720]   We'll be in a mansion.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   You'll start writing.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.440]   Your next book will be a poetry book.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.680]   Yeah, reflections from you staring
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.640]   at the waves from my mansion.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.580]   (upbeat music)
