[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.720]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.640]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.840]   I've kind of lost my voice,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   but I'm excited to have you here today.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.380]   Now, you may already know that I'm a big fan
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.840]   of the Animal Spirits podcast,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.160]   which is all about the markets and investing.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.720]   And in light of everything that's been going on recently,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.120]   I wanted to invite the show's host
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.420]   and my friend, Ben Carlson,
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.800]   to join me again today on the podcast.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.280]   Ben's also a financial advisor
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.640]   at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.560]   He's the author of four books about saving,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.160]   investing and money.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680]   And he's become one of my go-tos
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.120]   for questions about investing and personal finance.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.800]   If you wanna check out our last conversation,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.040]   it's episode 42.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.560]   But today we're gonna talk about the state of the market,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.160]   the regional banking collapse,
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.320]   interest rates and inflation,
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640]   and what we should all be doing about them,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.720]   including anyone who's looking to buy a home right now.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.520]   I am really excited about this one.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.280]   Ben, thanks for being here again.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.460]   - Glad to be back.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.960]   - There is a lot going on in the economy right now.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.420]   We're recording this on May 18th.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.800]   Seems like everyone I know,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.120]   both now and for the last three or four years,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.920]   has been saying, "Oh, there's a recession coming.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.360]   "We gotta prepare for it."
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.200]   I feel like I keep hearing this message.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.180]   Maybe that's just what everyone is always saying,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.520]   but how would you describe
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.080]   the current state of the markets?
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.120]   - It'd be the most telegraphed recession in history, right?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120]   If and when it happens, everyone can say, "I predicted it,"
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.920]   because that's what everyone's been doing
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840]   for a couple of years now.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.580]   It's a weird time because the economy remains
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.020]   stronger than anyone could have imagined,
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.820]   with the Fed going from 0% to 5% on rates.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.660]   If that happens, which this is the fastest rate hike
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.020]   we've seen in history, most textbooks would say,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420]   "Okay, the economy's gonna slow down.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.900]   "It's that much harder to borrow,
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.100]   "and rates go that much higher
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.860]   "in such a short period of time."
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.300]   The economy has to go into recession,
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.520]   and the Fed has wanted people to basically
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.500]   lose their jobs to slow things down a little bit,
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.560]   and it hasn't really worked as much as they would like.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960]   The unemployment rate has actually fallen
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.220]   since the Fed started raising rates,
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.780]   which is not what you would expect.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.160]   So the economy is way stronger, I think,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.260]   than anyone would have imagined,
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.100]   in terms of people still wanting to spend,
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.980]   and the unemployment rate remaining low.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.420]   It's as low as it's been since 1969.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.060]   Everyone's waiting for the next shoe to drop,
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420]   but as of right now, things remain okay,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.380]   especially considering the environment,
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.200]   that no one would have expected things to remain this strong,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.100]   yet here we go.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.540]   - For anyone without context,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.420]   why is the Fed acting so aggressively right now,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.520]   or has been, to raise rates in an unprecedented speed?
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   - They just don't want inflation to be entrenched.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.120]   That's what happened in the 1970s.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.760]   Inflation was here for a while.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.280]   It had started rising in the '60s,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.200]   and then throughout the '70s,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.100]   we had this 15-year period
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.760]   where inflation was basically above 4% or 5%.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.600]   It got as high as 15% in the early '80s,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   and the problem is,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.520]   once the psychology of inflation takes hold,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.000]   and you start to think,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.500]   "Things are going to be more expensive in the future,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.220]   "so I'm gonna buy stuff now,
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.520]   "and I need more money through my employer,"
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.040]   so there's like this wage price spiral
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.600]   where people need more money,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000]   which then pushes up prices more,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   and the Fed doesn't wanna get
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.520]   into that sort of psychological situation.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.980]   They're just terrified of a 1970s repeat.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.480]   There's a lot of reasons.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   I think those fears are a little overblown,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.400]   but high inflation hasn't happened in this country
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.760]   for the past 70 years.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   That's like the one period we can point to, right?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.540]   The 1970s and the early 1980s,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.480]   so they're just deathly afraid
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.240]   of that situation happening again,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.720]   so they want to stop it
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   before it gets really ingrained in our psyche.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   - Has it worked?
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.840]   Is that risk off the table, or is it still looming?
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.960]   - So inflation is still higher than most people would like.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.600]   It's still running at 5% or so annualized
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   over the last 12 months.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.160]   The Fed wants it to be at 2%.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.960]   I think it's going a lot slower than they thought,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.800]   but if you look at the past,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.400]   inflation doesn't just all of a sudden
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.720]   go from 9% to 2% in a straight line.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.840]   It takes some time to work this stuff off,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.160]   and so I don't think it's as easy
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.440]   as most people would like it to be.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.760]   The Fed seems to think
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   that they still have a little bit of work to do
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.080]   because they're keeping rates higher
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.000]   and potentially raising them even more.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.960]   - I know there's been a handful of things
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.320]   on a macro level.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.640]   There's been this debt ceiling conversation.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.840]   There's been regional banks collapses.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.080]   How much of those totally separate factors
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.680]   are part of all of what's going on?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.440]   - It's one of those unintended consequences thing
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.380]   that the Fed raised rates
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.400]   because they wanted to slow the economy,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.760]   and that would have maybe thrown some people out of a job,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.840]   and that would have slowed demand, right?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.680]   That's the whole idea.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.720]   They want people to spend a little less
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.600]   so the prices stop going up.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.560]   The unintended consequence is
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.960]   these banks all purchased bonds at ultra-low rates.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.320]   The generationally low rates we saw,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.480]   10-year treasury yields were at 1%,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.720]   which is as low as they've ever been,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.560]   and banks bought them,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.680]   and the Fed raising rates this high
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   basically messed up the balance sheets of these banks.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   So that was one of the unintended consequences of it.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.560]   - It seems like we've learned some lessons from 2008
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.720]   and that we're not just gonna let contagion happen
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   from that sort of stuff.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.880]   This is a completely different situation from that,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.920]   in that we're not dealing with a bunch of credit problems
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.040]   and people overextending themselves
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.960]   in the housing market and that sort of thing.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.600]   So this isn't 2008,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.720]   but I do think if you put some truth serum
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   into the Fed officials,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.080]   they'd be surprised that this is the way that it played out,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   that we have a banking crisis before the economy slowed,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   and they've been able to clean it up so far
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.520]   without many huge problems.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.560]   - Yeah, I mean, as an SVB customer,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.640]   I could say that there were four days of angst and anxiety.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   - Yeah, you had a bad weekend, right?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   - But at the end of the day, everything was there.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.120]   My mortgage is still with SVB,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.920]   or I guess with First National, I think,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.480]   or whatever the name of the new bank is,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.160]   but it kind of all worked.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.640]   - Well, I'm gonna ask you, what's that like now?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.360]   Is it just the same thing, basically?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.120]   Do you feel like anything has changed?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.960]   - It's interesting because SVB
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.680]   was kind of a reputational bank.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.160]   The reason most people banked with SVB
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.520]   was that they just had great relationships
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.840]   in Silicon Valley.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   And it wasn't actually the migration
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.680]   from SVB to First National that made me think,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.640]   "Okay, maybe this isn't the right fit for me anymore."
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.840]   First Citizens, sorry, I just remembered, First Citizens.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.600]   - There's a lot of first something banks.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.480]   - I know, I know.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   I wonder if the history of that, by the way,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.560]   is that people wanted to be the number one ST
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.200]   at some point in the phone book,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.720]   and then they were like, "Well, now that that doesn't matter,
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.120]   "we don't need to spell it with a number."
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.720]   But digression, people that I've heard that work at SVB
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   are now, and this is very anecdotal,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.160]   but kind of not treated like first-class citizens
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   at the new institution.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.280]   - That makes sense.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.840]   - Which we've kind of heard from a few people,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.280]   which led me to say, "Look, if this new bank
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.600]   "isn't gonna treat their employees great,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.240]   "how are they gonna treat their customers in the long run?"
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.920]   So we were kind of benefits
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.800]   of the JPMorgan Chase crazy weekend
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   of let's go steal all the SVB customers.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.760]   So we took the bait there and moved over.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.280]   There wasn't really any incentive other than moving over.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.040]   And so we still have our mortgage there.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.280]   I still have an auto ACH three days
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   before the mortgage payment to move the mortgage payment
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.080]   into the SVB account so that it's ready
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.600]   for the mortgage withdrawal.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   But other than that,
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.440]   I think we've kind of fully migrated away,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.200]   but not for reasons that I'm worried about the money.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.560]   I'm not worried the money's gonna go away.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.680]   - They've done a good job shoring that up,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.480]   and people worry about, "Oh, we're gonna lose faith
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.160]   "and trust in the whole banking system."
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   Probably not.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's probably more these bigger banks
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.400]   are just gonna get bigger.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.840]   And you're probably not gonna see as many perks
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.200]   as you were getting at an SVB kind of bank
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.160]   as you would have in the past.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.440]   And I think that's probably what the knock-on effects
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.360]   are gonna be of just JPMorgan and Bank of America.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.440]   People are just gonna feel safer having their money
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.480]   at one of these bigger banks.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   And I think that's probably what's gonna happen.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.120]   - Even though the FDIC thing,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.920]   I'd never been through or witnessed
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.840]   what happened when a bank collapsed.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   It blew my mind that in what seemed like 24 to 48 hours,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.320]   a bank effectively collapsed, was protected,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.280]   and funds were made available.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.120]   If you'd asked me with no context
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.640]   how long it would take a government entity
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.120]   to solve that problem, I would have said months.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.280]   And then when it was like over the weekend,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.440]   it didn't even take one full business day.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.240]   - They almost snapped their fingers 'cause they could see it.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.440]   Yeah, it was a social media bank run.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.480]   It happened so fast.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.920]   The old story from back in the day, the panic of 1907
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   was JPMorgan told his bank tellers
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.080]   to count the money out as slow as possible
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.320]   to stop a bank run, right?
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.880]   So people couldn't get their money out fast enough.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.240]   And obviously you can't do that today
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.960]   because people can just push a button.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.920]   So the Fed has to act that fast, I think.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.520]   That's almost one of the positive externalities
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   of the 2008 crisis is they realized
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.160]   this stuff can happen so fast
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.440]   that we have to step in right away.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.960]   We can't let contagion spread and go from bank to bank
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.080]   because that's just chaos.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   - I was still surprised.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.200]   No matter how fast they thought they needed to act,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.160]   I was actually surprised that they could act.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.560]   Government entities are not known for their speed.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.480]   - Yeah, they're not handcuffed.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.200]   - But what's the average investor right now
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.320]   supposed to do any differently
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.920]   after watching regional banks collapse?
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.560]   Do we change anything?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.400]   - Probably not.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.160]   I think it's only like 1% of bank accounts
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.240]   across the country have more than $250,000 in cash
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080]   sitting in a bank.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.960]   And if you have that much money sitting at a bank
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.040]   and it's earning the 0.1% that you can get
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.960]   at a savings account at a brick and mortar bank,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   then you were making a mistake before this.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.720]   That was something that should have been remedied
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.960]   before this whole thing happened.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.680]   So I think now you've seen a huge shift.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.560]   A bunch of money is going into money market funds,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.640]   in treasury bills, in online banking accounts.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.360]   That's the big first step people should have been taking
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.960]   for years is don't have your money sitting
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.000]   in a savings account at a bank
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.280]   because they're not going to pay you anything.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.320]   You have to have it somewhere else.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.120]   In the past, you might've been able to earn 50 basis points
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.800]   or 1% or something like that,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.280]   which no one really cared about.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.480]   But now we're talking three, four, 5%
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.520]   because short-term rates are higher.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's the only thing people need to worry about
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.320]   is just if your cash is sitting in a checking account
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.400]   earning nothing, then it's way easier now
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.240]   to earn some sort of yield that you couldn't in the past.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.320]   - I want to come back to that yield,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.760]   but what about from the market standpoint?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.960]   You've been saying rates are rising.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.840]   The goal is to potentially create
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.440]   even a small recession to curb inflation.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.200]   Knowing that's something that the Fed's trying to do,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.440]   are you doing anything differently?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.080]   Are you advising clients to do anything differently
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.320]   with their investment portfolio?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.640]   - The hardest question to always answer
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.000]   about the markets is what's priced in, right?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.320]   So we had a big bear market last year
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.680]   where the S&P 500 fell 25%.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.000]   The NASDAQ 100 was down well over 30%.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   So was that bear market pricing in a recession already?
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.640]   And has the market already sort of digested this
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.240]   and we already expect there to be a mild recession?
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.920]   Or was that just we were dealing with higher rates last year
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.800]   and higher inflation and that made the equity markets fall?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.840]   So that's the hardest question to answer.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.720]   And even if we do go into a technical definition
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.160]   of a recession, which is all these different checkpoints
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.040]   that the National Bureau of Economic Research creates,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.200]   by the time we actually know we're in a recession,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.120]   it's probably gonna be too late
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.000]   and the stock market will have bottomed anyway.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   I think that's the hard part about timing of these things
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.000]   is that, especially during a slowdown,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.240]   the stock market and the economy
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.000]   are never going to fully line up.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.280]   And the weirdest thing could be,
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.000]   we could go into a recession
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.400]   and the stock market looks over that valley and sees,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.600]   listen, we've already had all this pain
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   from higher inflation and we've already priced in a slowdown
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.000]   and the stock market may just take off
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.760]   before any of that even happens.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.800]   That's the hard part here.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.840]   Obviously, the other side of it would be,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   the economy slows more than people are expecting
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.360]   'cause the Fed went too far and we have this hard landing
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.160]   and the stock market does roll over again.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.280]   That's always a possibility.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.040]   But I think you could see some sort of counterintuitive
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.280]   situation where the stock market actually does fine,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.480]   even if the economy slows,
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.760]   'cause we've already priced it in.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.080]   - It's why I kind of haven't touched anything
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   in my portfolio really for the last handful of years,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.000]   if not decade, because I don't know.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.800]   Every time I've tried to catch a falling knife
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.920]   or make a bet that I thought was going to do well,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.400]   if it wasn't something I really felt like I understood,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.320]   I've always seemed to regret that decision.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.200]   - My general guiding principle is the stock market
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.480]   usually goes up, but sometimes it goes down.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.120]   And that could be for any number of reasons.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.640]   I think the stats that I've used
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.400]   are over any one year period,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.680]   we're up three out of every four years on average.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.840]   It doesn't follow that exact pattern,
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.240]   but that just means if you were a strategist on Wall Street
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.440]   and you had to predict every year,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.160]   what's the stock market going to do?
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.560]   75% of the time, if you just said it's going to go up,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.040]   you would be right.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.560]   So I think the people get stuck constantly
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.800]   trying to predict the downside and what's going to cause it.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.320]   And I think if you just let yourself understand that,
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.640]   I know the downside there is going to happen,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.080]   but most of the time the stock market is going to go up,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.400]   corporations are going to make more money.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.720]   They're going to pass those profits along
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.000]   in terms of share buybacks or dividends
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.040]   or profits or all these things.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.760]   Instead of trying to think through the next recession,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.120]   I think people are probably better off
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   preparing for personal finance
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.120]   as opposed to their portfolios when it comes to recession,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.680]   because that's way more impactful.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.520]   - And what does that mean,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.400]   preparing your personal finances for recession?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.560]   - Well, I mean, whether it's a recession or not,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.680]   if your income is impacted by your current situation
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.160]   and you have a problem for most people losing your job,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.520]   that's not a recession, that's a depression.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.120]   That's a huge impact on your whole life.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.960]   So just understanding what your prospects are
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.920]   and how safe you feel at your job
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.280]   or how steady your income is.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.680]   Do you have a fixed salary you earn?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.800]   Do you have a variable income that could change
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.640]   if things slow down?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.800]   I think understanding these things,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.160]   what is your fallback in terms of
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.200]   not only emergency savings,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   but any sort of other liquid cash that you could tap?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.040]   Is all of your cash tied up in your house or in a mortgage,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.200]   or do you have other ways of accessing cash
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.120]   if something should go wrong?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.480]   'Cause we've seen in the past,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.040]   you being on the West Coast know this better than anyone,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.480]   technology went from being just bulletproof as an industry
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.200]   and things were going great.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.700]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.360]   the tech sector seemed to be the only place
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.040]   that was in a recession.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.320]   And people were losing jobs
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.240]   and trying to figure out what it all meant.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.140]   I think having that fallback plan is always a good idea,
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.720]   regardless of whether the country's in a recession or not.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.440]   Because the economy as a whole can impact you,
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.360]   but a lot of it is personal
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.400]   in terms of what is impacting you and your day-to-day
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.160]   and your own personal economy is a lot more important.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.000]   - I have a couple of thoughts there,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.960]   but I wanna ask about the tech recession, if you will.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.840]   I know a lot of people were holding stocks
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.240]   that were down 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.160]   close to, in some cases, 100%, not quite there.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.880]   I've heard a lot of people say,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.680]   "I don't wanna sell all these things that are down 90%
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.840]   "because when things get a little bit better,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.000]   "they're going up."
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.260]   My response to them has been,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.800]   "Yeah, but if you could erase the middle
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.660]   "and look at how have they performed over five years,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.080]   "it might not actually look as bad
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.320]   "as you feel it is right now.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.900]   "If this company is a mess and their stock's down, great.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.640]   "But with the entire tech industry down,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.640]   "is that a reversion to normal
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.400]   "or should people still be holding out hope
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.040]   "that it's gonna kind of correct?"
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.160]   - Well, that's probably one of the biggest biases we have,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.920]   especially when trading individual stocks, is anchoring.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.520]   And you say, "As long as I just break even, then I'll sell."
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.720]   Or, and especially this,
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.320]   a lot of people are looking at the higher watermark
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.480]   and assuming that means break even.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.020]   But that, to your point,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.620]   you had massive gains for some of those.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.580]   If you've been in it for five, seven years,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.820]   you had massive gains running up to that.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.460]   And one of the hardest things to understand
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.620]   about catching a falling knife
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.740]   or just holding a falling knife
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.340]   is a lot of stocks just never come back.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.100]   Cisco peaked in 2000
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.420]   and still hasn't come back to those same levels.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.420]   General Electric was the biggest company in the world
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.300]   through the whole '90s
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.220]   and is now down 75% from those levels.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.740]   I think the number from a JP Morgan study a few years ago
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.660]   called Agony and Ecstasy
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.860]   said that like 40% of all US stocks going back to 1980
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.520]   experienced a 70% drawdown or worse and never recovered.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.260]   Right, so even though the stock market as a whole
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.460]   will continue to charge higher
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.260]   because the new winners will come up
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.620]   and make up for those losers,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.900]   a lot of stocks just never come back.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.260]   And I think that's the hard part to understand.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.700]   And it's an impossible question to answer.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.900]   Like, am I being disciplined or am I being delusional?
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.940]   You think I'm being Warren Buffett 'cause I'm holding here,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.620]   but then you don't know, like, well, wait a minute,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.740]   this stock is down 80%
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.780]   and I can't tell if I'm being delusional or disciplined.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.780]   So I think the first part is just having it
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.340]   so that one stock or that handful of stocks
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.460]   aren't your whole portfolio.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.340]   You're not so concentrated that it's going to ruin you
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.460]   if it never comes back
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.300]   and you're just sitting there like waiting and waiting.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.580]   So I think just position sizing
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.700]   and having those individual bets
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.380]   be not your whole portfolio
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.180]   or not a major part of your portfolio,
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.980]   that's part of it is just not being overly concentrated.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.380]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.220]   I get it.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.900]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.780]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.860]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.780]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.740]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.460]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.260]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.100]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.540]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.500]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.980]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.060]   that you got through another week.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.140]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.700]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.460]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.540]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.220]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.780]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.760]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.800]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.620]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.700]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.340]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.820]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.460]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.740]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.760]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.780]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.020]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.620]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.740]   and my info as possible.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.620]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.740]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.020]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.980]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.180]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.520]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.020]   it only took a few minutes
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.100]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.160]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.100]   for this episode.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.900]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.180]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.980]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.100]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.740]   and get that removed as well.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.680]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.060]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.540]   in their first two years,
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.420]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.360]   for their customers.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.420]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.920]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.940]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.480]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.980]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.260]   So on one end of the spectrum, you hold one stock,
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.440]   it's down a lot.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.820]   Like you said, there's a decent chance
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.460]   that stock's not coming back.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.820]   On the whole market side, if you hold VTI,
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.260]   you hold even the S&P,
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.620]   you could probably feel reasonably good
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.780]   that it's coming back.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.940]   How do you feel about an industry, like tech in this example?
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.620]   Like if you were holding a basket of 100 stocks
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.060]   or an index fund focused on tech
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.520]   that's taken an outsized beating,
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.940]   do you treat it more like a stock
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.440]   or do you treat it more like the market?
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.220]   Probably somewhere in the middle for sure,
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.940]   but you can have a subsector like the energy industry.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.540]   For the whole 2010s, it was just getting slaughtered
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.140]   'cause oil prices were coming down,
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.220]   interest rates were low, inflation was low,
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.860]   and as the stock market took off,
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.780]   the energy industry was just doing horribly
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.060]   and tech was doing great,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.220]   but you could have been in any industry
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.300]   and just gotten crushed.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.260]   Same thing if you picked a subsector like regional banks.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.780]   For the past 10 or 15 years, right,
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.420]   you've made basically nothing
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.300]   even though the market is up three or 400%.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.640]   So I do think that the tech sector is so much bigger now
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.980]   than it was in the past.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.120]   It's not a little piece of it
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.800]   like the regional banks are, right?
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.080]   The fact that it's so much bigger
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.620]   and just part of our lives
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.160]   would give me a little more confidence there
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.280]   that if you're holding the sector,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.780]   but we saw after 2000, it took the NASDAQ,
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.320]   I don't know, 12 or 13 years to completely come back
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.280]   and that was after an 80% crash,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   so that was way worse than this one,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.460]   but there's nothing that says focusing on a whole sector
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.920]   means you're gonna be okay and totally diversified.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.800]   It's not like a sector is gonna go out of business,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.720]   so that's different than holding an individual stock.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.020]   If you work in the tech sector
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.140]   and you have 100% of your money invested in the tech sector,
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.800]   that's a double whammy potentially
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.900]   and I think having some diversification outside of it
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.420]   for your investments is a pretty good idea.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.260]   - That makes a lot of sense.
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.320]   I also wonder at what point
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.060]   we stop calling it the tech sector
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.840]   because it seems like is Peloton a tech company?
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.000]   Is Zillow a tech company?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.860]   Like there are all these companies that have websites
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.840]   and people interact with them online,
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.320]   but I would actually love to see someone
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.480]   abandon the concept of the tech sector
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.740]   and bundle these companies into their
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.000]   kind of more normalized sector,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.620]   maybe their sub-sector now just become the major thing
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.640]   and then all of a sudden I wonder how this looks.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.480]   - That's the thing.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.680]   It's like Amazon is, I think,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.920]   technically considered a consumer company, right,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.480]   in the way that they break out their geek sectors of the S&P
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.760]   and Facebook is a communications company,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.600]   not a tech company,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.080]   so yeah, the way that they've doing it,
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.080]   it is kind of mashed together.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.040]   I think if you really boil it down,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   I think if you included those kind of companies,
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.040]   I think it's probably more like 40% of the S&P 500
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.000]   is made up of tech companies.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.360]   To your point, that's a pretty good chunk of the pie,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.560]   so that diversification maybe is a little bigger
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.120]   than it has been in the past.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.280]   - And I think it probably would have helped earlier
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.920]   if we had done it because there'd be companies
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.400]   that I think were getting these valuations and multiples
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.680]   because everyone assumed they were tech companies
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.800]   and then once you kind of peel back the onions,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.380]   you look at earnings, they're going public,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.680]   you're like, wait, was Lyft a technology company
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.000]   or was it a transportation company?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.200]   Because it was valued like a tech company,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.280]   maybe it shouldn't have been.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.160]   And once that kind of all corrected,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160]   my unfortunate belief is that the small portfolio I have
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.240]   of some individual tech stocks,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   I'm not waiting for it to kind of correct
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.440]   as much as it declined.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.120]   In some ways, I'm kind of in the process of just getting out.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   - And maybe one of the ways to answer that question
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.760]   in terms of holding these things,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.560]   again, because there are gonna be some of these companies
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.720]   that fell 60, 70% or whatever,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.760]   Facebook is a good one that's already come back quite a bit,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.400]   but some of these are gonna look
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.480]   like unbelievable buying opportunities in the future.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.320]   You're gonna look back and you go,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.720]   man, I could have bought that stock
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.880]   down 70% or 80% from the highs.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.240]   I guess a good way to frame this for yourself is,
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.400]   would I be willing to put more money in now?
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.480]   Or if I was starting today from scratch and I'm all in cash,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.800]   100% of my portfolio is in cash,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   would I buy these stocks again?
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.240]   Because that's the opportunity cost thing
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.560]   that you're always asking yourself,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.920]   is there a better opportunity out there
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.240]   in terms of investable assets?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.720]   And if you wouldn't buy those stocks again today
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.600]   or you wouldn't start into them
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.200]   because you're coming from cash,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.520]   maybe that's a good way to answer
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.880]   how disciplined you should be in terms of holding them.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.360]   - And when it comes to that opportunity cost,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.080]   there's something that I've really been struggling
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.400]   with processing lately,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.320]   and I'm hoping you can guide me
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.920]   and anyone else with the question.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.320]   Historically, for at least the last, I don't know,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.560]   five, 10 years, no one's really ever thought of cash
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.760]   as an asset that would even come close
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.560]   to the kind of long-term portfolio
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.640]   you'd expect from the markets.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.280]   But I worked at WealthTrap for a while,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.600]   you kind of talk about the, is it five to 10?
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.320]   Who knows what you want to call your portfolio's
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.800]   long-term expected return.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.680]   There's risk and volatility in that number.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.240]   But with cash at such a high rate right now,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.120]   is there an argument that should actually be a part
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.440]   of your investment portfolio
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.000]   instead of just the place you park
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.240]   some emergency funds on the side?
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.600]   - The way I think about this is,
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   what part of your portfolio are we talking?
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.000]   A young person with 100% invested in stocks,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.840]   and they're going to say,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.520]   "I'm going to take a certain percentage of this
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.200]   and put it in cash, 'cause it's running 5%,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.120]   and it's way less volatile, and it's just easy money,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.840]   I'll clip that 5%."
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.080]   Or do you have a fixed income part of your portfolio
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.760]   where you're in an 80/20 portfolio, right?
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.040]   You're 80% stocks and 20% bonds.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.440]   And does it make more sense to take that 20% in bonds
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.320]   and just put it all in cash?
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.480]   That's an easy one for me,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.120]   like that you could go from bonds to cash.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.720]   I think that's a pretty simple decision.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.280]   'Cause you're earning more in cash
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.240]   because the Fed has jacked short-term rates up so much
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.080]   and long-term rates haven't followed suit.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.640]   By going into cash or short-term whatever,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.680]   you know, money markets or CDs,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.440]   you take away the interest rate component.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.120]   So any sort of variability in movements,
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.680]   'cause if rates rise even more,
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.000]   bonds will get hurt still, right?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.840]   So if you're in cash,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.520]   you don't have that interest rate risk.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.400]   If you're in a bond piece to cash, that's an easy decision.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.200]   For me, that's a no-brainer.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.360]   But if you're going from stocks to cash,
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.040]   now that's hard because now you're really
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.080]   sort of timing the market.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.040]   And the problem is, let's say we do have this recession.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.200]   Everyone is predicted.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.360]   In 12 months or so, we go into recession.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.680]   By that point, the Fed's not going to leave rates at 5%.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   The Fed's going to lower rates.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.800]   Let's say they bring rates back to 2%.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.520]   Your cash yield immediately goes from 5% to 2%
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.880]   when the Fed lowers rates, right?
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.560]   So now you're sitting there and,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.040]   okay, I took 20% out of stocks and I put it into cash.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.120]   It was way easier of a decision at 5%.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.280]   Now it's 2%.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   Now what do I do?
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.160]   And I think that's the hard part about trying to time it
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.680]   with money that's in risk assets,
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.480]   is I think you have to figure out what your exit plan is.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   And maybe it's, well, if stocks fall 10%,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.720]   I'll buy some more from cash and I'll leg back in
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.560]   or whatever it is.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.680]   But I think you have to have an exit plan to determine,
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.720]   is this money going to be in cash for a long time
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.400]   or is it just for a short-term trade?
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.560]   And I think that's the hard part,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.920]   is determining how long that money sits in cash for you.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.960]   - Let's say I make a rule right now.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.560]   I'm like, okay, when rates drop below 3%,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.320]   I'm putting it all back in the market.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.240]   Do you think that there's going to be
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.400]   some type of correlation, positive or negative,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.560]   with if rates do drop from 5% to 2%,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.240]   is there something that's likely happening in the market
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.360]   at the same time or is it, who knows?
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.200]   - That's the worry.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.240]   If rates fall and people decide,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.040]   okay, the stock market looks better to me,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.160]   and the stock market front runs it
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.480]   and you miss a 25% gain in three months or something,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   that's the problem.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.760]   And then the hard part about sitting in cash
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.200]   and market timing in general is,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.560]   first, you have to be right twice.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.320]   You have to get out at the right time and then get back in.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.280]   And getting back in is usually harder.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.920]   And the funny thing is, it's hard in both directions
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.520]   because if the market falls 20% from here
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   and you're sitting in cash,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.000]   you're patting yourself on the back and you're going,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.480]   whoo, I missed some of that with some of that cash
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.120]   I'm sitting on, I'm doing great.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.160]   But then you become wedded to that cash.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.240]   You think to yourself,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.000]   well, it's just going to get worse, right?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.520]   To your point, you have to have rules in place.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.560]   Otherwise, you're just going to sit in that cash forever
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.400]   and you're never going to get back in.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.800]   I can't tell you how many people we talked to in 2013,
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.560]   2014, '15, who said, I went to cash in 2008,
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.840]   I thought I was a genius, I never got back in.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.880]   That's the hard part is getting back in.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.760]   The other part is the stock market goes up 20%
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.520]   and you see it getting away from yourself and you go,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   oh shoot, I missed that.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.560]   Now I can't get back in, now I got to wait till it falls.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.920]   And what if it keeps going up more, right?
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.960]   So that's the problem.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.160]   It's just a psychological game.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.520]   So if you're going to do that,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.640]   then I think you have to have some hard and fast rules
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.840]   in place ahead of time.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.520]   I'm going to put half of this back in
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.400]   if the stock market falls 10% from here, 20%.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.300]   Or if the market rises from here,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.320]   I'm going to dollar cost average once a month
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   for six months or whatever it is.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.960]   I think you have to have some hard and fast rules
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.200]   because otherwise it's going to play head games with you.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.340]   - But it does sound like historically rates drop,
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.520]   people think borrowing is cheaper,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.840]   companies want to spend more, the market goes up.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   I'm not going to say you're going to be certainly correct,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.800]   but if rates do drop to 2%,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.920]   historically more often than not the market goes up.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.200]   And if you miss that,
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.280]   then getting that extra few percent for a handful of months
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.360]   or even a year is probably not worth
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.560]   missing out on that swing.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.040]   - The good news is unless we have a calamity event,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.560]   it's not like the Fed is going to go overnight
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.680]   from five to two, right?
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.280]   They're going to go down in a stair-step approach.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.600]   They might go down in bigger increments
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.920]   if things get really bad,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.400]   but it's not going to go immediately from five to two.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.440]   It could go from five to four and a half to four.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.280]   It would take some time
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.200]   unless something really gets broken in the economy.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.520]   - Does that mean that, like you said,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.160]   unless something really gets broken,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.040]   we could probably expect these rates
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.920]   at least in the, let's call it two plus percent
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.400]   for at least another year?
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.440]   Or how are you thinking about how long we might have rates?
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   Or could it be 10 years?
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.680]   - The Fed keeps saying higher for longer,
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.840]   but obviously that all depends on the economy.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.000]   But I think going back to a 0% world
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.440]   seems pretty far-fetched at this point.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.760]   That was coming out of the 2008 crisis,
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.640]   trying to get that back up and running again.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.200]   And then the pandemic really brought rates
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   to levels that we didn't think were possible.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.320]   So I think a world of two to 3% rates
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.600]   would make more sense to me for something that's normal,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.000]   if that is a thing, as opposed to going back to 0%.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.960]   I do think that makes a little more sense,
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.720]   assuming inflation falls.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.000]   And that's the other thing here.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.920]   If you really wanted to get technical with it,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.760]   someone would say, "Great,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.680]   you're giving me 5% nominal rates,
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.600]   but real rates are zero because inflation is 5%.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   So if I adjust it for inflation, it's 0% anyway.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.960]   So what am I really getting here?"
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.280]   And that's the problem is if inflation falls,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.240]   you would expect rates to come down with it eventually.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.920]   It's unfortunate that you're not going to earn 5%
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.840]   if inflation is at two.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.640]   It's probably not going to be that good of a deal.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   So if inflation falls, rates probably fall too.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   - Okay.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.880]   And we're talking about all these rates.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.400]   We've talked about a couple examples of where to put money.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.440]   IBONs were all the rage
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.640]   when you're locking in these really high rates.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.000]   We still have some inflation,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.760]   but given the rate hikes for the Fed,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.880]   is that even a thing that you're seeing people
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.280]   get excited about anymore?
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.920]   - The yields aren't nearly as juicy as they were.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.280]   They got up to as high as what, over 9%, I think.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.800]   They based it on the previous six months worth, right?
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   And so now the yields are 4.3%.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.600]   And you can get more than 5% in T-bills.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   You can get well over 4% at a lot of places
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.720]   in terms of online savings or cash management.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.280]   So yeah, I think the IBONs had their day in the sun.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.200]   And I think a lot of people were willing
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.800]   to go through the hassle of using Treasury Direct,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.400]   which was a website that felt like it was from 1994.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.960]   And I know a lot of people told me they had problems
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.200]   and you were capped at the amount of money you could put in.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.880]   And there was penalties if you pulled the money out early
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.120]   and all these things.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.560]   It was worth it to jump through those hoops
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.680]   when you could get nine plus percent, but at 4.3%.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.280]   Now that we're back on par with other things,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.440]   it's probably not as advantageous.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.520]   - The way it worked was you locked it in for six months
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.960]   and then it reset based on whatever was happening.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.680]   And I believe if you take it out within five years,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.600]   you get a three-month penalty,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.960]   but you have to hold it one year.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.760]   So given where the rates are now,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.800]   I got to go look at what rate I'm currently locked into.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.640]   But I think as soon as I hit about three months
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.360]   past a rate under 5%,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.120]   I'll probably be pulling all the IBON stuff out myself.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   - It made sense, but it was a flash in the pan
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.280]   kind of thing.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.440]   I've seen high yield savings rates anywhere from,
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.560]   there's still your go to chase, you're getting nothing,
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.760]   but in the four to 5% range.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.440]   But with T-bills and tax treatment for them,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.760]   is there any argument to not be putting all your cash there
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.960]   in some form?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.200]   - It is higher yielding.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.240]   I've had a lot of people ask me,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.400]   how do I buy actual T-bills?
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.520]   - Let's ask how you buy it.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.960]   Is it even worth it or just buy a short-term ETF?
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.760]   - I think ETFs are probably easier
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.360]   'cause the way it works is a T-bill,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.320]   because it's so short-term,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.080]   it could be one, three, six, 12 months,
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   you don't actually get any interest payments.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   You buy it at a discount and then you get it at par.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.240]   So let's say you wanted $1,000,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   you would pay 900 or whatever.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.200]   If it's 5%, maybe pay 950.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.240]   And then in three months or six months or 12 months,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.200]   you'd get $1,000, right?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.080]   But there are T-bills that are already out there
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   that are not new.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.280]   So you have to kind of check the pricing.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.840]   And unless you've done it before
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.760]   and used a broker to buy bonds like that,
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.880]   it's probably a lot easier to just hit a button
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.840]   and buy an ETF and go that route.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.960]   That's what I've decided to do.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.640]   - And the ETF just pays out the dividends
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   from the fact that they're constantly buying
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.760]   and selling these in that format.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.600]   - Yes, it's just much easier.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.840]   The rates are pretty low.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.520]   Any Vanguard, iShares, Charles Schwab,
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.720]   all these places, Fidelity,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.280]   will have short-term Treasury bill ETFs.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.360]   - And the tax treatment,
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.960]   whether you buy direct or in the ETF,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.280]   you still get that advantage?
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.760]   - Yeah, so it's the same deal.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.320]   I do think online savings accounts
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.120]   have some benefits as well.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.800]   I find it easier to move money in and out of them.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.040]   I mean, it's not a big hassle,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.600]   but if you're trading T-bill ETFs
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.560]   in a relative brokerage account, you need the money,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.600]   you sell it, then you have to wait two or three days
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.800]   for the money to settle, and then you can pull it out.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.040]   And so I think there is a little bit of an advantage
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.880]   to an online savings account in that
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.000]   if you really need the money in like a day or two,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.720]   it's much easier to get.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.760]   - Yeah, but if you live in California,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.880]   if you live in New York,
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.440]   and you're getting hit with seven, eight, nine, 10% tax rates
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.400]   or higher, it seems 5% short-term Treasuries
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.720]   plus the tax benefit, it seems hard to beat.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.560]   - It's not a bad deal.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.920]   - As long as you have money set aside.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   We talked earlier about the way to prepare for recession.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.000]   Maybe it's not as much in your portfolio
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.120]   as your personal finances.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.040]   One thing that I've been thinking is,
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.880]   okay, depending on how stable your income is, right?
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.040]   Like my income now as a creator is based on sponsor revenue
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.080]   and affiliate revenue.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.400]   So the market really does take a turn.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.880]   That stuff cuts quick.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.400]   Brands are, we're not gonna spend anymore.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.240]   Budgets are cut.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.360]   And so I'm thinking about emergency fund
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.320]   in a way that I didn't when me and my wife
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.120]   both had employment.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.520]   We had jobs where we were probably less likely
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.920]   to get let go just on a whim.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.160]   And if we did, we'd probably have some type of severance.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.760]   Is emergency fund the kind of main tenant
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.720]   of preparing your personal finances for that?
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.440]   And do you ratchet up that number?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   The more you feel like your job's less certain
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.560]   or how do you think about that?
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.680]   - I think that makes sense.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.120]   If you're in an industry where you think
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.800]   it's very cyclical and could have an even bigger downturn,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.360]   it's kind of like looking at difference
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.440]   between stocks and bonds.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.640]   If you're a teacher,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   you know that you're pretty safe in your job.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   You're pretty solid there.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.680]   But yeah, if you're in a cyclical industry,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.040]   like technology or energy
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   or any sort of variable income stream,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.000]   maybe it makes sense to have a bigger buffer there
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.880]   or understand where other sources you could pull from
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.120]   in the event that something goes wrong.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.960]   Do you have a home equity line of credit you could tap?
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.080]   Do you have other areas
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.640]   where you could pull some money out of?
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.480]   I think that makes sense
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   to just have that parachute just in case.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.960]   If you're comfortable in the past
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   with six months worth of savings in emergency fund,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.240]   maybe you go up to nine months or 12 months
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.760]   because it gives you a little bit of extra buffer
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.680]   if you have to make up for that spending shortfall
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   if you stop making as much money.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.920]   - One thing I try to remind people
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.800]   is you might know how much you spend.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.920]   You might track your spending and you might have a good sense
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.680]   and by all means, if you want to maintain that lifestyle
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   in the circumstance that you lose your job
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.600]   or lose your income, you can,
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.400]   but I try to say you could also price your emergency fund
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.880]   as if you made some cuts.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.320]   If every year you're the kind of family
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.440]   that takes $20,000 worth of family vacations
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.040]   or whatever the number is,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.760]   you could probably cut that to zero if you lost your job.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.040]   So your emergency fund doesn't necessarily have to be,
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.880]   if it's six months,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.080]   six months times however much you spend in a year.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.120]   It could be six months times
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.080]   however much you would spend in a year
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.760]   if you made some cuts.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.080]   And for some people, there's not a lot of room for cuts.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.200]   For some people, there might be a lot.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.320]   - Yeah, if you lose your job,
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.240]   I bet it's pretty easy to figure out those areas
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.320]   of variable spending where you can cut, right?
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.360]   Okay, this streaming's gone, this streaming's gone,
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.200]   the gym membership.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.960]   There's probably ways that you can figure out pretty quickly
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.360]   yeah, those places that you're gonna cut back
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.000]   because it just doesn't make sense anymore
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.080]   in your new situation.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.480]   - Anything else you think on the personal finance side
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.640]   that people should consider thinking about
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.760]   in light of what could happen in the economy
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.880]   and the markets?
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.120]   - I think especially for young people,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   it's never a bad idea to always have some conversations going
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.280]   in terms of future employment opportunities
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.640]   and talking to people in other areas of your industry
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.840]   and just having a foot in the door
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.600]   if you need to have that conversation
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.280]   because the whole process of finding a job
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.920]   sometimes can take a lot of time.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.280]   So just having conversations,
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.480]   especially if you know that you're not completely locked in
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.800]   and this is my dream job, I'm gonna be here forever.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   If something does happen,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.000]   I think just having those lines of communication
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.480]   always open for future employment opportunities
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.840]   is a good idea.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.000]   - And it's a lot less pressure
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.440]   to have a conversation with a company
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.680]   if you're not trying to actively find a job.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.520]   - Exactly.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.920]   - When you're like, "Hey, I'm looking for a job."
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.600]   It's like, "We're not hiring for this right now."
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.440]   But if you're just like,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.040]   "Hey, I wanted to connect with someone in the industry."
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.280]   Building that out,
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.040]   someone's gonna build a cool personal CRM for job searching
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.080]   that kind of lets you do this more proactively in advance.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.960]   You probably just ask ChatGPT to do it all for you
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.800]   now that I think about it.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.640]   - Right.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.800]   - Okay, you mentioned HELOC
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.960]   as a potential thing you could tap.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.840]   Let's talk about the other side of the equation, right?
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.120]   Rates are high.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.960]   When it comes to buying a home,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.280]   I think that people like myself who kind of,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.040]   I have only been in the market for home buying
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.720]   in an incredibly low rate environment for the last decade.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.520]   I know lots of people in my peer group that are like,
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.480]   "I can't buy a home now.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.280]   "Rates are so expensive.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.920]   "I gotta wait for them to come back down.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.200]   "You got two point something.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.760]   "I'm not gonna pay four or five something.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.600]   "Is that crazy?
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.400]   "Should people just adjust to the new normal?
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   "Are they so anchored
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   "that they'll kind of live in stress for the next 30 years
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.200]   "if that's their app mindset?"
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   - Yeah.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.880]   Unfortunately, so much of financial success
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.640]   is out of your hands at these sort of things
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.280]   where luck and timing plays such a huge role.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   If you bought a house pre-2021 and had pre-2022 rates,
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.200]   you're in a very good position financially, right?
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.720]   If you bought in any time in the 2010s or prior,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.840]   you're doing wonderfully in terms of home equity
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.600]   and having the ability to refinance or have a low rate.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.440]   If you're buying now,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.480]   affordability has never been this bad before.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.520]   If you combine housing prices up 40%
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   since the start of the pandemic
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.200]   with mortgage rates that have doubled
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.520]   off their lows to six to 7%.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.880]   And the problem is that I think the Fed assumed
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.120]   if we raise rates and mortgage rates come up,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.280]   housing prices have to fall, right?
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.040]   Because if we're combining this insane run-up in prices
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.600]   with these newer higher mortgage rates,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   the monthly payments,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.280]   it just, for a large percent of the population,
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.600]   doesn't make sense affordability-wise, right?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.880]   I'm double whammy of higher prices and higher rates.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.280]   The monthly payments alone disqualify a lot of people
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.120]   to be able to afford it.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.880]   Plus you have to come up with a much bigger down payment.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.120]   And unfortunately, I think a lot of it
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   is probably based on demographics
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.200]   and the fact that we had all these people
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.680]   with 3% mortgages.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.520]   The prices aren't coming down nearly as much
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.800]   as people would have thought.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.200]   Again, in a textbook scenario, rates go up,
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.600]   prices should come down because so many people like us
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.200]   are sitting on 3% mortgages going,
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.960]   "There's no way in hell I'm getting rid of this mortgage.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.800]   "I'm sitting in this house
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.480]   "and I'm going to stay in it longer," right?
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.120]   So what we've had is just all the supply on the market
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.480]   has just vanished, essentially.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.240]   And so we now have higher prices.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.160]   They've come down a little bit
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   and in certain areas more than others,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.920]   but they haven't rolled over.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.160]   I think some people were expecting
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.600]   we're going to see a 2008-type 20% crash in housing prices.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.040]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.080]   Maybe if mortgage rates go to 8% and stay there,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.240]   it'll happen, but it hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.560]   And I think part of that is because all the supply
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.960]   has been sucked out of the market.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.840]   Anytime there is a house that comes on,
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.880]   there's still all these millions and millions of millennials
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.200]   who want to buy, who miss their opportunity
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.600]   or just weren't ready and the timing wasn't right.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.160]   They still want to buy them because supply is so low.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.920]   Now it's still hard to buy a house
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.600]   because the pool of buyers has grown
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.960]   'cause they've been waiting,
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.760]   but the supply of houses is down.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.680]   So it's almost harder to buy a house now.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   I definitely feel for people who are in that situation
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.240]   and trying to buy.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.000]   And unfortunately, I think what's going to happen
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.120]   is if rates do fall,
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.480]   say they go from 6.5% to 5% or 4.5 or whatever,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.720]   I think that's just going to bring more people
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.560]   off the sidelines.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.400]   And maybe that'll be a good thing.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.200]   It'll bring out some sellers too,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.920]   but we're in a very bad place in terms of
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.800]   if you're a first-time home buyer looking to buy.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.640]   If you're someone who's lived in a house
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.960]   and you have all this equity,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.040]   sure it'd be hard to trade up from a 3% mortgage
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.560]   to five or six,
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.920]   but at least you have that equity to use as a down payment.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.160]   If you're coming in completely free,
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.560]   and clear of any housing asset,
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.640]   it's a really tough situation.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.200]   And your only hope is really,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.560]   I'm going to buy now and then I'm going to refinance
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.040]   if and when rates fall in the future.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.880]   That's the hope.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.600]   - To me, if I were buying right now,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.200]   it seemed like the strategy to lower your mortgage payment
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.280]   would be to do a short duration, adjustable rate mortgage,
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.120]   because there doesn't seem to be any benefit
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.080]   to locking in today's rates for 30 years.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.880]   Does that seem sane?
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.440]   - You probably get a little bit of a better rate
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.520]   on an adjustable rate.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.040]   And then again, you can hopefully, if rates fell,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.160]   then you could refinance again at a lower rate.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.240]   That's the hope.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.680]   You're rolling the dice that that's going to happen.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.920]   And in that case, a recession,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.120]   unfortunately you'd probably be cheering one on
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.960]   because you'd want lower rates from that,
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.640]   which is a weird place to be.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.560]   I feel for people who are homebuyers right now,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.480]   it's a really, really tough situation.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.200]   And I can't imagine the stress you're under
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.120]   constantly looking and having no inventory
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   and higher rates and higher prices.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.160]   It's tough.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.920]   - And is there anything to do
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.120]   other than the strategy you talked about?
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.920]   - I don't know.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.760]   It's really difficult.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   I think you just have to make sure you're ready
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   and that you can handle those payments.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.320]   And some people are going to have to maybe grow into them.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.800]   That's a good thing is most people's income
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   goes up over time.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.000]   The payments are fixed.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.120]   You can grow into them a little bit
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.040]   and hopefully refinance over time.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.640]   If and when rates fall, that'd be the only silver lining.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.240]   - Now I know in the past,
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.120]   we've ended up in housing situations
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.840]   because people want to buy homes.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.480]   We want to make it a little easier.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.440]   Let people do these kind of interest-only mortgages
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.920]   with giant balloon payments
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.680]   and things that pop up at years out.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.400]   Is there any world where that happens
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.120]   and people start to get really aggressive
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.840]   or are banks not kind of getting as aggressive
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.960]   as they used to to kind of hold back in that situation?
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.680]   And for context, there was a time
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.760]   where you could put a very little amount down
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   and you could get an interest-only mortgage,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.280]   but five, 10 years later,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.640]   you'd have to start paying the principal.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.840]   And in many cases, your mortgage payment could 2X.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.920]   - Yeah, big balloon.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.680]   - And so your bet was, "Oh, my salary's gonna go up."
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.800]   But many people's salary didn't go up enough
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.560]   to support a 2X mortgage payment.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.680]   So I'm just curious if that's a strategy
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.040]   that someone could use
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.440]   or whether banks are even comfortable with that anymore.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.480]   - That's the biggest difference
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.840]   between now and the 2008 situation
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.400]   and the run-up in the 2000s,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.560]   is you were getting these ninja,
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.600]   no-income, no-job applications.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.200]   And now, we've never had better credit scores
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   for people who are buying.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.000]   So the people who are buying houses,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.320]   who've bought houses in the last three to five years,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.720]   have had much higher credit scores.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.480]   We're not talking about subprime lenders or borrowers.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.320]   We're talking about people with high credit scores.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.240]   They were not doing these adjustable-rate mortgages.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.520]   They were locking in 30-year fixed rates.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.640]   And so the housing market,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.880]   from a balance sheet consumer perspective,
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   is really, really strong
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.160]   and about as well as a place as it's been.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.040]   So they're not those problems.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.680]   And that was why you saw fire sale prices
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.240]   in 2008 through 2012, as the housing market cratered,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.840]   is people just couldn't afford their payments anymore.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.440]   And when they lost their jobs, it was a double whammy
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.480]   and they had to get out of the houses.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.120]   And that's why prices fell.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.240]   It would be hard to make a case
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.120]   that prices are gonna rise substantially from here
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.720]   after we've pulled forward so many price gains,
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.200]   but it's pretty tough to see
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.160]   how housing prices could fall substantially
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.440]   because we don't have that situation
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.840]   where people are forced out of their mortgage
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.680]   'cause they're underwater.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.920]   Because even if you ran into trouble,
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.520]   people have a ton of equity in their home, right?
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.440]   Because prices have risen so far.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:35.040]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.520]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.280]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.560]   to other people in your situation,
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.160]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.440]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.280]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.440]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.520]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.960]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.360]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.640]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.780]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.160]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.880]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.680]   are first generation wealth,
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.760]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.880]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.240]   and learn from each other
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.840]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.120]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.440]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.880]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.040]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.000]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.480]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.900]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.560]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.020]   So many of these conversations
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.220]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.900]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.760]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.940]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.000]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.660]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.600]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.660]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.460]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.500]   And so if you're on the other side of this,
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.520]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.560]   I locked in one of these great mortgages,
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.900]   but circumstances have changed, I wanna move,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.720]   we need a different house, family's grown,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.180]   family's shrunk, with such a low rate,
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.960]   is it crazy to do anything other than kind of keep it
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.260]   and try to become a landlord?
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.820]   I feel like people would be faced with this,
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.820]   I don't wanna give up my 2.75 or 3.25% mortgage right now.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.260]   Is there any creative way that you can keep that mortgage
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.700]   and like somehow do some kind of weird
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.860]   sell to own kind of situation?
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.300]   - The renting thing is something I think a lot of people
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.920]   did during the pandemic, because they could go from a 3%
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.800]   and then borrow for another 3%.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.160]   It's a little harder now because the payment
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.080]   in a new one would be so much higher.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.480]   My prediction is I think if rates stay high,
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.040]   one of these banks is gonna let you port
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.640]   over your 3% mortgage to a new one.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.760]   I would love to see that.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.960]   I don't know how exactly that would work,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.440]   but I wouldn't be surprised if rates are higher
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.120]   if someone tried that as a sort of gimmick at least.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.160]   But unfortunately, there's not much you can do.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.400]   I think eventually life gets in the way.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.080]   And we've had this supply shock where the supply
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.380]   and the housing market is just completely dried up.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.220]   People get married and they have kids
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.380]   and they die and they move and they lose their career.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.580]   All the life happens and that's why people move.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.780]   I moved in 2017 because my wife and I had twins on the way.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.420]   And we just totally outgrew our house immediately.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.460]   We didn't plan on moving, it just sort of happened.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.140]   So I think the housing market will eventually
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.180]   get to a better steady state because life gets in the way.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.180]   And again, I think people will just sort of
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.540]   plug their nose and move.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.180]   I think the number from the Wall Street Journal
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.420]   I saw the other day was people on average
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.900]   have an extra $270,000 in equity
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.100]   above what they had going into the pandemic.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.840]   And so it would sting to move from a 3% to a 6% mortgage.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.140]   But if you have that equity built in
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.300]   that you can use for a down payment
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300]   to lower what you're going to have to borrow
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.260]   in the first place, I think eventually people will say,
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.900]   you know what, if this is going to make my life easier,
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.260]   I can move to a better school district
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.960]   or a bigger house for my kids with a backyard,
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.500]   or I move somewhere where I'm going to be happier
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.740]   and I can live somewhere else
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.860]   because I can work remotely, all these things.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.900]   Eventually that will happen.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.340]   And I think that you're probably in a much better position
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.280]   than someone who is a first-time buyer right now.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I go back to what you said earlier
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.380]   about anchoring.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.220]   It's like, this is what the rates are.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.900]   Like you could dwell on the fact
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.560]   that they're not as good as they were before
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.800]   and hearkens of those times where your parents were like,
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.740]   I used to be able to buy that thing for a nickel.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.020]   But at the reality is that's just not the circumstance
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.100]   we're in now and life needs to move on.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.620]   And I did this great interview with Bill Perkins
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.100]   who wrote this book, "Die With Zero."
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:49.940]   - Love that book.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.740]   - And it's really just changed my perspective of like,
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.740]   look, money's purpose should not be
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.220]   to just grow money at all costs.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.940]   It should be to help maximize your net fulfillment.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.940]   If you need a bigger house for your family to be happy,
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.260]   it might cost a little bit more.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.980]   You might be paying a higher interest rate,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.180]   but the end of the day, if you don't have the money,
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.600]   of course, that's not a good option.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.020]   But if you do have the money,
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.380]   think about what's going to maximize
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.820]   your net fulfillment in life.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.500]   - We mentioned the HELOC before.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.100]   Another option is you have to pay 7% now for HELOC probably,
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.540]   seven or 8%, but you could pull some of that equity
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.680]   out of your house and do an addition or something, right?
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.740]   If you really didn't want to move
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.180]   and you wanted to keep that mortgage,
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.180]   you're gonna be borrowing money, just maybe not as much.
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.160]   You pull $50,000 out of your mortgage
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.860]   or 100,000 or whatever it is,
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.780]   you add that third stall garage or that extra bedroom
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.620]   or fix the backyard up or whatever it is
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.140]   and stay where you are and remodel a little bit
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.180]   using some of that equity that you've built up.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.100]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of companies,
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.020]   I can't remember all the names of them,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.460]   that have made like ADU the most like easy process.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.980]   Like we will drop ship a container
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.460]   that is exactly a perfect setup, ADU in your backyard.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.180]   So if you only have to borrow for that
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.660]   instead of have to get a new loan for something else,
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.840]   that's actually a really great option, I like that.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.640]   I did an episode with the host
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.940]   from the BiggerPockets real estate podcast.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.660]   It was yesterday or two days ago.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.440]   I don't know if it'll come out before or after this,
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.300]   but we talked all about optimizing the home buying experience.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.060]   We talked a little bit about doing it in this market,
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.380]   renting things out if you can.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.420]   So either go listen to that or expect it,
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.420]   depending on whether it's out.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.020]   - What was their advice?
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.740]   - Their advice right now that I think
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.180]   is probably the most relevant thing
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.000]   is to not focus on the hot homes.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.220]   It's like there are homes out there
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:24.460]   who have crappy pictures, who are in a weird place
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.060]   that's not the most obvious place that everyone wants to be.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.080]   Look for something that's been on the market for 30 days.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.940]   Maybe it's on the market for 30 days
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.820]   because the kitchen is completely closed off and has a door.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.660]   Well, guess what?
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.740]   Moving walls is not that expensive,
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.420]   but there are a lot of people that walk into a house
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.940]   that are like, "Oh, I don't like this layout."
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.900]   And they just leave.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.860]   And so it is so much easier to fix a few walls
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.380]   than it is to compete
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.740]   for the hottest home in the neighborhood.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.860]   - Yeah, figuring out how to not get in a bidding war.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.760]   Look for something that's been on the market for a while
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.220]   because those people will probably be desperate
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.860]   to sell as well 'cause they've probably been sitting there
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.320]   wondering, "Is this gonna happen for me?"
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.160]   - Just like you said,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.620]   now might be a good time for renovation.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.340]   The big takeaway I had for people right now is
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.860]   you don't have to necessarily buy a plot of land
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.060]   and build a whole house,
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.260]   but maybe you could buy a house
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.500]   that's not exactly what you want
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.420]   and the amount you'd have to put into it
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.420]   might be net total less than what it would cost otherwise.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.580]   And so that was their advice.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.980]   But the building thing, if you can,
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.660]   is actually not a bad idea
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.580]   because that's where you're getting
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.740]   a lot of the breaks now is the builders,
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.060]   they're not in the position to sit back like us
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.300]   with a 3% mortgage and just wait it out, right?
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.020]   The builders have this land that they need to build,
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.060]   so they've been offering incentives
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.140]   where they'll buy your mortgage rate down for you.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.040]   So if you have the money to build,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.980]   you could be more like a 5% mortgage
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   'cause the builder wants to get that done
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.000]   and get it off their books
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.380]   where they'll buy it down from 6 1/2 to 5 1/2 or five
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.440]   and offer some incentives for you to build
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.340]   as opposed to buying something that's already there.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.180]   - I don't think I know anyone who's even bought and built,
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.900]   so I don't know anything about that process.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.300]   - It's not a fun process
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.800]   because there's a million things you have to pick out,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.860]   but whatever, you get a new home out of the deal.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.500]   - And you mentioned HELOC's rates going up.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.020]   Anything someone should be doing
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.900]   if they have other kinds of loans right now
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.700]   with rates up, student loans maybe?
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.020]   - Well, the big one is probably auto loans right now,
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.220]   which I think the average is like 8% on an auto loan.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.380]   And that's another place where prices have risen.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.720]   So if you could hold out on buying a new car,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   now is about,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.000]   I mentioned that it's a really bad time
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.980]   for a first-time home buyer.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.200]   It's a really bad time to buy a new car
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.760]   because they still haven't figured out
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.840]   the supply chain stuff
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.640]   because of a lot of the parts coming from overseas.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.520]   But if you drive by a car dealership,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.200]   you'll see that there's still a lot of empty slots
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.000]   where cars should be, right?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.480]   And with 8% rates and used car prices high,
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.000]   it's not a great time to buy a car.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.840]   So if you can make your car last a little longer,
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.140]   try to wait it out an extra 12, 15, 18 months.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.080]   If you can, that's not a bad idea
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.640]   because going into a new loan,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.440]   you're getting three or 4% car loans
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   back in the day too, right?
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.480]   Now we're talking eight, nine, 10% sometimes
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.400]   for an auto loan.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.080]   So if that's something where your car can still make it,
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.200]   but you really want a new car,
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.280]   it's probably best to wait it out at this point.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.120]   - It's wild.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.360]   I'm looking at the credit union
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.640]   that we got our auto loan from right now,
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.160]   and it's at 7.99%.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.080]   I will say, do please shop around for auto loans.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.580]   It is absolutely crazy how much of a better rate
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.740]   you can find looking at a ton of credit unions all over.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.020]   I scoured the internet.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.380]   There's this crazy spreadsheet
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.180]   that some Tesla enthusiasts created
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.420]   with like all the rates from all the credit unions.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.340]   I found a diamond in the rough,
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.180]   and I'm actually looking.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:29.700]   We got our loan June last year at 1.99%.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.060]   - Yeah, and credit unions are a great place for that too.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.340]   - You don't have to be a member of a specific credit union.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.580]   You can almost always find some way to join them.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.440]   There was one credit union I remember,
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.720]   I think it was the Christian Community Credit Union,
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.240]   that had the best possible rate
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.800]   when we bought a car five years ago,
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.880]   but you needed to submit evidence of tithing
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.120]   to one of their member churches.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.800]   I was like, okay, that one I can't.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.560]   That one, I was like, I would just not feel good
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.200]   trying to meet those requirements.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.320]   It would cross that ethical boundary for me.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.400]   For many other ones, you need to just join,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.480]   or maybe in Palo Alto, the Stanford Federal Credit Union,
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.880]   you can join by making a $5 donation
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.500]   to the Palo Alto library.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.040]   In student loans, is there anything
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.240]   someone with student loans right now
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.400]   needs to be thinking about?
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   I don't know a lot about how student loans function
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.960]   in kind of fluctuating rate environments,
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.620]   but I figured I'd ask.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.680]   - Well, people in the student loan,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.100]   they've been able to basically put off their payments
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.440]   for so long because of the pandemic.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.780]   So that's something that's probably
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.800]   just coming back online for people,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.200]   is making their payments again,
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.240]   'cause they had the ability to put off those payments
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   because of the pandemic.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.400]   So I think that's something that the delinquencies
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.040]   for student loans is on the floor right now,
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   because most people weren't paying them
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.640]   through the pandemic,
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.920]   and now they have to put their payments back on.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.000]   So that could be kind of a shock to people
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.800]   that they put those payments on hold for a while,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.640]   and now they're coming back.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.720]   So that's probably the bigger thing,
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.560]   as opposed to the rates,
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.220]   is people just having to make payments again at all.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.200]   - Okay, I got one question from a listener
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.720]   about something related to investing
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.720]   that I wanted to ask you, or at least read to you,
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.200]   because I feel like you could do a better job answering it.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.040]   So Daniel said,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.480]   "How do you estimate risk and potential upside?"
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.640]   He says, "Personally, I always calculate the risk
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.620]   "as a potential loss, as a percentage of my net worth.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.660]   "I do the same with the potential upside.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.520]   "Helps me kind of quantify the potential impact
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.460]   "of the best and worst case."
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.840]   What do you think?
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.460]   - It is way easier to predict risk
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.860]   in something like the stock market
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.660]   than it is to predict returns.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.300]   I think because you're pretty sure
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.620]   that in any given year,
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.860]   you're probably gonna have a correction.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:19.900]   Every three to four years,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.960]   you're probably gonna have a bear market,
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.660]   and then maybe once every 10 to 12 years,
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.820]   you're gonna have a crash.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.060]   You can't really set your watch to it,
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.800]   but that's pretty darn close, that risk is there.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.600]   But if you look at, over time, the different decades,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.940]   the first decade of the century,
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.540]   the stock market went nowhere.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.000]   The second decade of the century,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.540]   we had huge returns.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.020]   The '80s and '90s were these huge returns.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.740]   The '70s was a terrible decade.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:40.580]   '60s was okay.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:41.420]   '50s was awesome.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.140]   The '30s and '40s were terrible.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.380]   And so, it's much harder to predict
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:49.200]   because of the unforeseen things that can happen
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.280]   that could cause things to be worse than you would assume.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.740]   So, I'm much more of a fan
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.740]   of trying to predict risk ahead of time than return
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.000]   and sort of being surprised on the upside.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.620]   But I think you can look at the historical range of results
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.820]   and understand that, over the long-term,
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.180]   corporations grow their earnings by whatever, 5% or 6%,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.420]   and dividends grow by 4% or 5% per year,
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.500]   and sort of get a good estimation of the long-run returns.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.700]   But unfortunately, in the short-term,
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.060]   it's basically impossible to predict
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.620]   what the stock market's gonna do.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.900]   That's one of the reasons
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.820]   that I think you're able to earn such high returns there
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.780]   is because it is so unpredictable.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.060]   I wish I had a better answer for you,
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.500]   but it really is difficult.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   And going down to the individual company level
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.020]   is probably even harder.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.260]   The only last thing I was gonna ask you before we wrap,
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.660]   you have a segment on your show,
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.580]   which I'm a regular listener.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.140]   We both release on Wednesday mornings,
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.860]   so every morning, I'm like, "Oh, I got mine out.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.520]   "Now I'm gonna go listen to Animal Spirits."
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.860]   You do a lot of recommendations.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.400]   You focus those on books, movies, shows.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.380]   But I did wanna ask if you had any recommendations
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.740]   for people that are interested in the personal finance,
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.900]   the investing side.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.380]   Are there any services that you use,
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.900]   whether it's tracking things or modeling things
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.640]   or following earnings reports
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.660]   that you think are cool things people should check out?
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.980]   - The funny thing is is when it comes
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.060]   to personal finance apps, I'm pretty old and stodgy
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.420]   where I still track everything on an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.700]   I never got into any of those tracking services.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.140]   99% of my spending is on a credit card,
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.660]   and I feel like I just kinda can track it that way
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.540]   through the credit card, and that makes it easier.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.580]   I was joking with my, I saw my parents this past week,
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.780]   and my mom still had a checkbook
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.900]   and was balancing her checkbook,
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.900]   which I thought was just the most antiquated thing
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.180]   I've seen in my life.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.900]   But I never got into too many of that things.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.620]   On the investing side of things,
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.300]   one of the new apps that I've been using lately
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.860]   to pay more attention, this started off for the podcast
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.100]   just to be more informed and ended up becoming
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.900]   an investor in the company, but it's called Quarter,
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.260]   where you can listen to company earnings calls on an app
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.740]   like you're listening to a podcast.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.800]   And you can listen to it at two-time speed,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.940]   and they give you a transcript,
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.700]   and you can also get the reports.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:47.740]   And they have a button where you can skip all the CEO
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.660]   and CFO mumble jumble and just go right to the question
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.700]   and answer from the analyst, which is pretty cool
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.460]   if you don't wanna listen to all that.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.220]   I have a handful of companies that I listen to,
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.580]   and it just gives me a good sense of what's going on
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.180]   in certain markets or just specific industries.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.220]   And I feel like that's a pretty good macro gauge
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.600]   to hear how things are going from the horse's mouth.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:05.660]   - And what about when someone's like,
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:08.420]   "Oh, how has XYZ stock performed over the last year?"
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.460]   What's your default website to pull up that chart?
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.800]   - So I have a lot of subscription things
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.460]   because of my job in Wealth Management.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.620]   So I use Y-Charts for most of that stuff for charting.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:19.900]   That's a subscription service,
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.660]   but there are free ones out there like Coifin,
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.580]   which is pretty good.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.660]   I still think Yahoo Finance is not bad.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.460]   Remember, Google Finance was really good for a while
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.300]   and they kinda just--
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.120]   - Didn't do anything?
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.380]   - I don't know, a few years ago kind of shut it down
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.020]   and just made it worse.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.020]   There's also good backtesting tools
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.940]   if you wanted to backtest an asset allocation or portfolio.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.700]   There's Portfolio Visualizers, always one of my favorites,
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.580]   that you could backtest specific ETFs or mutual funds
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.320]   or asset classes to see how performance would have been
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.220]   if you wanna kinda test out a portfolio.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.140]   - Okay, that's helpful, awesome.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.020]   Ben, this has been awesome.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.380]   Thank you so much for coming, and I really enjoyed it.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.540]   - Yeah, this was fun.
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:54.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.580]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.340]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.460]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.260]   for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.980]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.420]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.780]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:13.060]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.420]   That's it for this week, I'll see you next week.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.940]   (electronic music)
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.360]   (electronic music fades)
