[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.320]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.360]   And we're in May, May 2020.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.360]   And the good news is that I think
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.240]   the lockdowns are almost over.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.200]   I've got to believe that the lockdowns for most of us
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.000]   will be over by June 2020.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.480]   And life will kind of go back to the way
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.240]   it was with a lot of precautions.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.040]   Things are faring pretty well on the financial front.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.220]   The S&P 500 is rallying because in April,
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.800]   we only lost 20.5 million jobs when the expectations were
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   more like 22 to 23 million.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.840]   Now, obviously, the numbers are crazy high.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360]   But everything is about expectations
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.400]   as we've been talking time and time again.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   So the market continues to rally and hold up.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.480]   And the expectations are that there will be more stimulus,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.040]   more stimulus for the month of May and maybe June,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460]   maybe another stimulus check for all of you
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.480]   folks who make under $75,000 per person and $150,000 per couple.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.860]   Maybe more PPP money.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.000]   After all, there's something like, I think, 30 million
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.680]   small businesses, and only half of them applied.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.400]   And I think there's about a 30% to 40% chance
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240]   that the enhanced unemployment benefits gets extended
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.920]   from July 31 till maybe the end of the year.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.520]   Why not?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.080]   I mean, give me a break.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   There are tens and tens of millions of people unemployed.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.720]   So this is much worse than in 2008 and 2009
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.360]   in terms of the unemployment front.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.600]   Yet in 2008 and 2009, unemployment benefits
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.840]   were extended to 99 weeks.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.040]   So come on, government.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640]   Let's at least match that 99 weeks.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.240]   And things will probably feel much more secure for those
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.600]   who rely on those benefits.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   Now, it's important for all of us to continue
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.040]   to try to forecast the future.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   And since lockdowns are going to end,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.480]   I think, within the next 30 days to 45 days,
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.000]   it's important for us to step it up.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320]   Step it up these remaining 35, 45 days,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.320]   because a lot is at stake.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.380]   When I ran track in high school, my most hated relay
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.880]   was the 4 by 400 meter.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.680]   I was a sprinter.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.320]   I did the 100 meter dash and the 200 meter dash.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.080]   And the 400 meters, which is one lap around the track,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   was about 200 meters beyond what I could sustainably
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.960]   run at max speed.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.400]   And generally, I'm always trying to go max, max, max.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.520]   But 400 meters, man, it's killer.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.880]   Anybody who's run track before knows it's a killer.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   So I always heavily faded towards the end,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.800]   thereby letting my teammates down.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.720]   But our team was thin.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.360]   This is high school track.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.220]   And Sam can run the 100 to 200 pretty quickly.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.040]   We can train him to get better.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   So I had to pace myself and train in a different way.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.480]   I had to accept the fact that I would fall behind early
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.400]   to conserve energy.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.960]   And it was only after I fired up the afterburners
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.600]   at the halfway mark that we started
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.920]   getting more competitive.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.600]   We still didn't crush our opponents,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   but we were always in the race.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.160]   And you always want to be in the race,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520]   whether it's in a real track race
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.200]   or whether it's in a competitive tennis match or a basketball
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   game or at work or at life in your relationship.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.560]   You always want to give yourself a chance to win.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.060]   Because if you're not in the race,
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.920]   you're never going to win.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.560]   So given we're in May 2020, I feel
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.240]   like we're at the 300 meter mark.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.160]   By early June, the vast majority of us will be free again.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.840]   The politicians will figure out a way--
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.320]   different way-- a different way to control us,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.280]   to control our livelihoods.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   However, for the most part, we're going to be free again.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.280]   And although some of us, probably most of us,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.560]   are tired, we're kind of exhausted,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.680]   or maybe we started off the blocks too quick,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.320]   we've got to muster up our remaining energy
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.880]   to finish strong.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   I encourage you to use this month and any time left
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.680]   before the lockdowns are lifted to step it up.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   If you do not, there will be consequences.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.240]   And let's just think about the consequences for a second.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.720]   If you are an employee, this is a very, very precarious time
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.760]   for you right now.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   Your manager will decide who to demote, promote, and lay off
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.240]   partly based on how productive you were during the lockdown.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.360]   The lockdown period is one big productivity experiment.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.600]   Why on earth is the NASDAQ up for the year?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   Why?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   Well, one of the reasons why is because investors
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   believe technology companies can continue
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   to be productive with less.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.480]   So with less employees, with less office overhead,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.520]   and less expenses in general.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.360]   So when you can do the same with less,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.920]   your operating profit margins expand,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.800]   your profitability expands, and therefore,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.000]   your valuation multiple either stays or expands as well.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.840]   So as an employee, is your valuation multiple
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.120]   staying the same?
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   If it is, that's pretty good because other employees
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.320]   are seeing their multiples decline.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.400]   Or better yet, is your personal valuation multiple
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.100]   expanding so that you can get paid and promoted?
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.040]   I hope it's the latter because you really
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   need to figure out a way to provide value and make yourself
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.520]   indispensable during this lockdown period.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.280]   You will be evaluated when you get back.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.000]   Trust me, every single manager, the CEOs that I talk to,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   I talk to these folks because I know these folks.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.520]   And they are figuring out ways to cut costs, lay people off
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.600]   permanently.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.960]   This is like a permanent structural change.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.280]   And they are also seeing their stock prices
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.080]   do relatively well, at least here in tech land.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.840]   So they're thinking, well, if this is what investors want,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.120]   well, hey, I guess we're going to continue to give them
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.440]   what they want by being lean, as lean as possible.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.680]   So we're seeing a leaning of companies listed publicly
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.480]   and also a leaning of companies that are private.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.320]   The lean companies are going to do better.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.040]   That's just the way it is right now.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.160]   Let's say you're an entrepreneur.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.200]   You may see massive, massive pent-up demand
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.960]   for your products or services once the lockdown ends.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.280]   Are you going to be able to handle that without tremendous
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.080]   amount of preparation?
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.200]   You better prepare.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.760]   Otherwise, you're not going to be
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.040]   able to benefit from that uptick in demand surge.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   You need to find ways to capture that demand
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.320]   and also make sure that if we go back to lockdowns,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   if this thing relapses, you're going
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.160]   to be more diversified and better prepared.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.100]   In sports, you're either going to come out physically
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.640]   and mentally fitter due to all the time you've set aside
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.200]   to train, or you're not.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   You cannot depend on your opponent to slack off.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.280]   You just can't do it.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.480]   You know, when I play tennis, I'm always training.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.320]   I'm working on my backhand, my serve, my volleys, my footwork.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.560]   And I'm trying not to gain too much weight
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.200]   as a father of two now due to the lockdowns.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.520]   There is no way I can compete effectively
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.000]   by just hoping my opponents just slack off and chill out.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.040]   No, I've just got to control what I can control,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.480]   which is to stay in shape and work on my skill shots,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.600]   my power, my speed, and so forth.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.400]   And you've got to do the same thing.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.200]   You've got to train right now, because if you can't train
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.400]   right now and you're back to work,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.760]   and it's just back to go, go, go,
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.960]   then you're never going to have the time.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.040]   So you've got to figure out how to make time.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.160]   And it's the same thing with your finances.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.360]   We've been talking about this for years now,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   preparing for a downturn, taking advantage of an upturn,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.880]   taking advantage of situations that don't seem
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.960]   like they're going to last for a long time.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.120]   That's an arbitrage, whether it's in the stock market,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.340]   in the real estate market, in business, and so forth.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.960]   We cannot let quarantine time go to waste.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.800]   So in the spirit of doing what I say,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.440]   I plan to go from three posts a week to four posts a week
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   for the next three weeks.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.200]   And I plan to record at least one podcast a week,
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.240]   if not two a week, maybe even more.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.000]   Because from my standpoint, there's just so much
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.720]   to talk about and so much to write about.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.600]   And it's funny, because I know once the lockdown ends
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.720]   and when people can go back to work,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.880]   to go back to their office jobs,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.720]   it's not going to be obviously 100%,
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.940]   maybe it's 25% in the first three months
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.780]   and 50% in the next six months and so forth.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.700]   I know that demand and interest for listening to podcasts
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.320]   and for reading about personal finance is going to tick up.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.040]   And so during this time, I'm going to try to write
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.880]   and talk about the most pertinent things that are helpful,
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.640]   that are going to help people get ahead financially.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.720]   I don't want people to look at my podcast episodes
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.320]   and my writing during the two to three month lockdown
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   and say, "Well, what did you write about, Sam?
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.920]   "Did you just not write at all?
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.160]   "Did you just give up?"
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.420]   No, I'm not going to be the one giving up.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.720]   I'm going to step on the gas, just like in high school.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.440]   I'm going to accelerate and do more.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.840]   Because when we all come back,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.920]   we're going to determine who are the ones who tried harder
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.240]   and who are the ones who didn't try as hard.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.120]   And I think there's going to be a divergence.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.620]   There's going to be a divergence of performance
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.080]   once the lockdown ends.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.400]   And I want you guys to be on the right side
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.080]   of that divergence.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.000]   Finally, I just want to remind everyone
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.120]   that being smart is completely overrated.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.660]   Instead of being smart, you want to be consistent,
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.520]   you want to learn from your mistakes,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.080]   you want to keep on trying, and you want to keep on going.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.800]   That's the name of the game, folks.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.520]   If you want to get ahead financially
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.200]   or whatever it is that you're doing,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.880]   you've just got to keep on going no matter what.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.840]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.720]   And I'll speak to you guys soon
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.440]   because I'm going to be recording a lot of episodes
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.000]   over the next several weeks.
