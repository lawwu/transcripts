[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   One of the things I've heard you say in the past is that one of the only ways to make money is to be non-consensus.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   It seems like you have a lot of non-consensus takes in general.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.140]   So I don't believe what someone pushes in front of me.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.880]   I want to do my independent homework, and I want to do my homework by going to experts, not my friends.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:29.860]   One of the biggest differences I notice in the millennial generation versus a baby boomer is that baby boomers go to experts.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.260]   For advice, whereas millennials, my kids are millennials, they go to their friends.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.220]   Well, what do your friends know? It makes no sense to me.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.500]   I would go to my friends to find the experts, but I wouldn't go to my friends for advice.
