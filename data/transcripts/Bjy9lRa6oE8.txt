[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   new tech startups, making new movies, publishing new books, creating new art.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.200]   When you're doing something new, there's this pattern that
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.720]   just repeats over and over again.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.880]   And if you look back in history, it's basically been the pattern
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.280]   for hundreds of thousands of years.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.360]   You're going to do something new.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.440]   It's going to be very risky.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.520]   It's going to be some very complicated effort that's going to involve a
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520]   path-dependent kind of journey through a complex adaptive system.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.880]   Reality is going to be very fuzzy and messy, and you're going to have a very
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.840]   idiosyncratic set of people who start and run that project, they're going to
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.320]   be highly disagreeable because that's the kind of people who do new things.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.440]   They're going to need to build something bigger than themselves, right?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   They're going to need to assemble a team and like a whole effort.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.600]   They're going to run into all kinds of problems and issues along the way.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.520]   Every time you see that pattern, there's just this role where there's
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.760]   somebody in the background who's okay.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.560]   This one, not that one, this founder, not that founder, this expedition,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.760]   not that expedition, movie, not that movie.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.240]   And those people play a judgment and taste role.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   They play an endorsement branding marketing role.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.160]   and then they often play a financing role.
