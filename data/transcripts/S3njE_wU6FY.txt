[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   Will I cast my cares on God?
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.640]   And those cares keep finding their way back to me.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.400]   So how do I get rid of those cares for good?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200]   We get that question a lot.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.760]   And today it comes in the form of an email
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.520]   from a listener to the podcast named Claire.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.340]   Claire writes this, "Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.940]   "I'm a Christian college student
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.400]   "and I listen to APJ all the time."
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.360]   Wonderful.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.240]   Pastor John, I was recently rereading your book,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.960]   Battling Unbelief.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.200]   In the first chapter, you mentioned 1 Peter 5, 7
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.960]   and that we should be casting our cares on God.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.120]   I've often wondered about this command and how you do it.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.920]   How do you cast your cares?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.940]   Do you simply tell God you're giving up your worries?
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.720]   Additionally, once you do cast them,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   are we expected to forget those worries
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.080]   or can we expect them to come back to us?
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.960]   Pastor John, what would you say to Claire?
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   Suppose you lived in a village with about 500 people
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.560]   and no army, no fortress.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.780]   And suppose you heard that an enemy army
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.320]   of 5,000 armed soldiers was coming against you
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.720]   to take your village and destroy its inhabitants.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   Now that would be, in your heart, a burden.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.760]   It would be an anxiety.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.080]   And the kind of thing Peter says in 1 Peter 5, 7
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.720]   should be cast on the Lord, right?
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   Cast your anxieties onto the Lord, or Psalm 55, 22.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.120]   Roll your burden onto the Lord and he will sustain you.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.520]   He will never let the righteous be moved.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   And suppose that there was a king
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   with an army of 50,000 soldiers
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.520]   who had pledged himself to protect you and your village
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.040]   when you call him for help.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   So you send a messenger to the king
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   and plead with him to come
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.480]   and protect you against the enemy.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.880]   And he sends a royal messenger back with a message
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   with the official king's seal on it that says,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.180]   "I will protect you.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.000]   "The enemy will not overwhelm you."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.760]   Signed, the king.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.040]   Now, what would it mean for you at that moment
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   to cast your burden, to cast your anxiety onto the king?
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.360]   And surely the answer is,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   to the degree that you trust the king's promise
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.520]   to protect you, to that degree,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.400]   your burden will be lifted.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   If your trust is small, you will still feel burdened.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   But if your trust is great, your burden will be light.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.880]   So the key to casting your burdens,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720]   your anxieties onto the king
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   is to trust the word of the king, the word of promise,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.400]   which of course includes trusting that he has the power
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.680]   to do what he says he'll do.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.160]   He has the wisdom to be as strategic as he needs to be.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.840]   He has the will or the desire or the commitment
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.720]   to do what he says.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.160]   Trust will involve all those things,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.920]   but trust is the key to letting your burden go,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.420]   putting your burden on the king.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.660]   So when it comes to casting our anxieties onto God,
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.660]   the most fundamental thing is for God to tell us
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.520]   what kind of king he is.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   Is he the kind of God, the kind of king
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.000]   that wants to load his people down with burdens,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.240]   like slave labor, like the Israelites in Egypt
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.680]   loaded down with making bricks without straw
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.960]   because that's the kind of king Pharaoh was,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   or is he the kind of God that loves to lift burdens
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.040]   off of his people?
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.760]   What kind of God is God?
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.080]   That has to be settled and God has to tell us
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.280]   and show us what kind of God he is.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.680]   And oh, how liberating, how thrilling it was.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.080]   I can remember it.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   How thrilling it was for me when I first saw the texts
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.840]   that I'm gonna read right now.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.540]   I had never quite articulated for myself
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.240]   that God really is this way.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.800]   This is the kind of God who created the universe,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.880]   who sent Christ into the world,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.560]   who governs things by the providence of his wisdom.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.820]   He really is this kind of God.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.440]   So here they are.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.760]   Acts 17, verse 25.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.440]   God is not served by human hands as though
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   he needed anything, since he himself gives
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.340]   to all mankind life and breath and everything.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.240]   In other words, God has no needs at all.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.200]   He doesn't need me.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.040]   He doesn't need my slave labor.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   On the contrary, he shows his divine fullness,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.200]   wisdom, power, love by giving, not getting.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   That's Acts chapter 17, verse 25.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.160]   Here's Psalm 50, 12 and 15.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.040]   God says, "If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.380]   for the world and its fullness are mine.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.620]   Call upon me in the day of trouble.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.060]   I'll deliver you and you will glorify me."
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.580]   What an amazing two verses.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.400]   In other words, never think that you can glorify God
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.660]   by sacrificially providing for him,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.800]   providing your labor for him,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.180]   as though he depended on you for anything.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.180]   God is not glorified by being your beneficiary.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.460]   He's glorified by being your benefactor.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.660]   "Call on me," he says, "Call on me in the day of trouble.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.540]   I'll deliver you."
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.380]   Not the other way around.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.100]   I'll deliver you and you will glorify me
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.740]   for my delivering you.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.820]   He'll never surrender the glory of being
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.940]   the all-sufficient provider and deliverer.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.620]   Isaiah 64, 4.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.460]   Oh my goodness, this is glorious.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.780]   Remember the first time I saw this
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.400]   and had it pointed out to me
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.300]   of what kind of uniqueness God claims for himself.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.100]   Here's Isaiah 64, 4.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.100]   "From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.580]   No, I have seen a God besides you."
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.420]   Okay, now what's the uniqueness here
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.100]   that nobody has seen?
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.700]   Who works for those who wait for him.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.460]   In other words, what makes God unique
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.060]   among all the pagan gods of the nations
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.620]   is that he doesn't look for help.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.980]   He provides help.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.580]   He works for those who wait for him.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.000]   Bel and Nebo, those Babylonian gods,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.820]   they're like idols sitting on carts
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.540]   that you gotta drag around with yokes over your shoulder.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.860]   Whereas our God carries us, we don't carry him.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.820]   And maybe the text that amazed me the most
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.380]   of this cluster that I'm reading
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.560]   was 2 Chronicles 16, 9.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.460]   "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.540]   throughout the whole earth to show himself strong
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.320]   for those whose heart is blameless toward him."
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.320]   What that really says is God is prowling around.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   He's on the lookout for people who let him work for them,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.000]   for people whose hearts will turn to him
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.220]   and trust him to be strong on their behalf.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.940]   God is looking for ways, so to speak,
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.940]   ways to show off his power for us, not against us,
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.420]   for the sake of those who humble themselves
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.980]   under his mighty hand and trust him to work for them.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.620]   Amazing.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.140]   One more text to illustrate the point,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.860]   and it goes right to the heart of the matter
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.460]   because it has to do with the incarnation
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.500]   and what God was up to when he sent Jesus.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.180]   Here's Mark 10, 45.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.180]   "The Son of Man came not to be served,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:02.800]   but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.340]   In other words, at the very peak of the revelation
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.140]   of who God is, namely in the incarnation of his own Son,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.580]   the point he makes again is,
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.860]   "I'm not coming to recruit help.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.320]   I'm not coming to be served.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.400]   I'm coming to serve.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.160]   I'm the Savior here.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.840]   I'm the helper here.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.080]   I'm the rescuer here.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.960]   I'm the provider here.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.040]   I'm the all-wise guide here.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.020]   I'm the treasure here.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.400]   Don't switch roles with me.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.560]   Be needy, be satisfied, be trustful."
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.360]   So the answer to our most fundamental question,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.540]   what kind of God are we dealing with
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.420]   when it comes to burden bearing,
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.160]   is that we are dealing with a God who is so full,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.320]   he does not need our help to be fuller, to be better,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.480]   to be more effective, to be more satisfied,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.780]   to be more glorious.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.580]   All of his fullness, all of his excellence,
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.100]   his effectiveness, his glory,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.480]   all of it are shown for his people
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   by his working for them, not them working for him.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.780]   He lifts burdens.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.120]   We don't lift his.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.420]   So with this glorious, massive reality
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.420]   of the kind of God that we are dealing with,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.320]   what it means to cast your burden or your anxiety
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   on the Lord is that you listen to his promises
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.620]   concerning your situation,
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.220]   and you trust him, that he is the kind of God
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.120]   who is strong enough, wise enough, good enough
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   to take onto his strong shoulders your concern
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.380]   and fulfill his promise to you.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.820]   Now, notice that the command in 1 Peter
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.940]   to cast your anxieties on the Lord,
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.940]   in 1 Peter 5, 7, is preceded by the statement
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.280]   that God is mighty and followed by the statement
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.580]   that God cares.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.400]   Goes like this, "Humble yourselves therefore
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   "unto the mighty hand of God,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.540]   "casting all your anxieties on him
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.100]   "because he cares for you."
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.240]   Therefore, the casting of our anxieties means
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   trusting his might and trusting his care
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.400]   to fulfill specific promises that he makes
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   to his children in their various situations of life.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.840]   So, as I'm facing a situation of anxiety,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.260]   I admit that I cannot provide God's needs.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.640]   That's not my job.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.520]   He doesn't want me to take that role.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.340]   I'm helpless.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.960]   God is all sufficient.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   So, I call to mind a promise like Isaiah 41, 10,
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.000]   my go-to precious promise, where God says to me personally,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.400]   I can hear him say in my name almost,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.080]   "John, I will help you.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.980]   "I will strengthen you.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.980]   "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.240]   Wonderful promise.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.480]   And I trust that promise at that moment
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   and that trusting is the casting of my anxiety onto him.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:57.820]   If by grace, I am able to rest in the promise,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.280]   the burden is lifted and I can walk
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.920]   into the scary situation without fear.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:11.000]   So, never cease to be amazed that God is not a man,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.680]   that he should be served, but that he is God
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.800]   and that he delights to show his power and his care,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   not by burdening us, but by lifting our burdens.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.320]   Trust him for this.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.160]   - Amen, Pastor John.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.520]   We trust him for this.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.340]   We trust him.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.420]   Thank you.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.400]   And that was now the 30th mention on this podcast
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.040]   of Isaiah 41, 10.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.560]   A go-to precious promise is exactly right.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.660]   And if you want to find out how this text
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.240]   got so deeply rooted into Pastor John's life,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.320]   see APJ 1232 in the archive.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.880]   It's titled "John Piper's Most Used Promises."
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.240]   It's just a great episode all around.

[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:16.120]   Good people pleasing versus bad people pleasing.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.000]   There's a difference.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.360]   There's a difference between good people pleasing
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.920]   and bad people pleasing.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.720]   So how do we know the difference?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.520]   We need to figure it out, and we will next week.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.640]   I'm your host Tony Reike.
