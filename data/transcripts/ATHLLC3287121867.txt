[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.240]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.480]   hacks.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.640]   Now, there aren't too many words I could use this early in a show that might send
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   people running, but I'm going to use one today.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.840]   And I encourage you to fight that urge and stick around because I'm about to
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.080]   have an amazing conversation about budgeting with Jesse Mecham, the founder
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.640]   of what many consider to be the best budgeting process and tool in the market
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.240]   today, YNAB, or You Need a Budget.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.360]   Jesse started this company as a side hustle back in 2004 and has bootstrapped
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.040]   it to a place where they now support over 100,000 customers in their financial
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   lives.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.960]   He's also written a book on budgeting and hosts the YNAB podcast.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.080]   In our conversation, we'll talk about why budgeting gets such a bad rap and
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.360]   preview lots of people might just be doing it wrong.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   We'll talk about an approach to budgeting you could do in far less time than I used
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   to spend categorizing every single one of my transactions and hear about some of the
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.880]   hacks Jesse's picked up raising his family of seven children.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.680]   Also, I'm going to try to get a special deal set up for listeners who want to try
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.480]   out YNAB, so check out allthehacks.com/ynab.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.640]   Okay, and before we jump in, I always have to remind you, Chris Hutchins works at
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.120]   Wealthfront.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.120]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.280]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.240]   investment decisions.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.560]   Jesse, thanks for being here.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.480]   Absolutely.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.640]   So, you know, budgeting is such a charged topic.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.400]   I feel like people love it.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.040]   People hate it.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.280]   I'd love to get your take on just why is it so, so charged and is that controversy
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.000]   justified?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   I'll start with the second part.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.720]   Yes, it is justified.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.840]   I think it's totally justified to feel like budgeting means that you are never going to
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.640]   have fun again.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   You know, like if you think budgeting is like dieting, it's like, I will never eat
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   chocolate cake again.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   Like that's a horrible way to live your life, you know, or worse, your spouse or
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.920]   partner wants to start budgeting and you're like, Oh no, no, no.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.840]   I know what you're doing here.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.560]   Like there's so many scary things that are associated with the word budget only
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.040]   because people have been for the most part doing it wrong.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.880]   But we approach it that the budget is your plan and it's yours.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.000]   It remains yours forever.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.240]   And so that's where for me, I then can go out and play 18 holes because I said I
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.560]   could.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.880]   And so when I'm out playing, I'm mad about my swing or sad or feel guilty that I've
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.800]   spent money playing golf.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.600]   Like that's because I wanted to.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.520]   So budgeting lets you spend on what you want while not feeling guilty about it,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.000]   whether or not you actually could afford it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.160]   And we can unpack that if you want, but I don't blame people for hearing the word
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.640]   budget and kind of freaking out a little bit.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   Not at all.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.080]   It's very, it's very common.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.680]   And if someone is that person there, they're like, Oh yeah, okay.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   It's too good to be true.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.280]   What's the first thing you would tell them to try to come over to the dark side, I
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.560]   guess, and realize that, that budgeting maybe can be more freeing than it is
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.160]   restrictive.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.920]   Well, I can walk through like what, from what most people experience and you know,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.240]   you'll see something that you want and I don't want to, like when I say want, I
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.400]   don't mean any kind of moral judgment to it.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   Like, should you want it or not?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   It's just, you want it.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400]   So we're just dealing with like a pure one and someone will say, I want this.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   And then the first thing they'll ask is, can I afford it?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.520]   You know, could I buy this if I want it?
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.320]   And can I afford this is one of the most stress inducing questions we ask
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.120]   ourselves, or we ask each other for sharing finances.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.360]   Sometimes we don't ask each other.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   And that also is a whole other separate thing.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   So you say, let's say that you ask yourself, can I afford this?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   And then you say, yes.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   Then you buy the thing.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.680]   You don't actually know if you can, you looked at your bank balance.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   You saw that it was high or low, whatever that means to you.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   And you gave yourself permission to buy it.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.200]   But then after the fact, so many times people will be like, ah, should I have
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.480]   shared that they'll feel kind of this little pang of guilt, like, I don't know.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   Worse.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   They get a bill the next day that I hadn't thought about when they were
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.520]   doing the, can I afford this dance?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.680]   And then they know they couldn't afford it.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.200]   Then they feel really bad.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400]   Or the flip side is the person actually can afford it.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.640]   They do buy it, but they don't know that they could.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   So whether or not they can't afford it or can't, they both don't know it.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.480]   And they both feel guilty or consternation or stress because of it.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.280]   So a budget solves that stress of, can I afford this by telling you?
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.440]   Yes, you can go buy it.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   Enjoy it.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   Don't feel guilty about it or no, you can't.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   And that still brings a lot of people peace and resolution to
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   what they're trying to figure out.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   Now, does it mean you can't ever buy it?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.280]   No, no.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   It might just mean you need to wait a little bit.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.640]   You know, you might need to wait a paycheck or two, but it's freeing
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.560]   because it frees you from that question that you can't answer accurately.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.320]   And that's what we're trying to tackle for people.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.200]   And does it have to be hard?
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.240]   Is there a 80/20 to get started that doesn't involve looking at every
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.960]   expense you've had for the last year and categorizing everything?
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.160]   That often seems daunting.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.040]   When you said it's like a plan, it's like, oh man, I got to put
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.560]   together a full financial plan.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   That sounds scary.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.240]   What's the way to get started thinking about it that maybe doesn't have to be
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.320]   so scary and you can do in, you know, minutes or maybe a couple hours.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.160]   Let's do it.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   Well, first, first, do not look back.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   So with the first rule of budgeting, I mean, we have four rules.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.560]   Our first rule is not actually this, but really what we're talking
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.960]   about is do not look back.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160]   Do not look at your history.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's already done.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   It's finished.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.400]   So you can't, you can't change anything about it.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   We only are looking forward.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   That will save you countless hours.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.720]   If you just say, oh, I'll just deal with what's forward.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.840]   Then if you're talking about five minutes, pull out your phone, look at your bank
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   balance and ask yourself one question.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.680]   This is the question you ask.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.080]   What does this money in my bank account need to do before more money will come in?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.520]   Don't tell yourself, oh, more money will come in on Friday.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.680]   So what should that money do to it?
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.520]   Resist the urge.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.560]   When we coach people, sometimes one-on-one a little bit, they'll often
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.960]   say like, oh, well, I'll get paid.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.560]   Jesse, hold on.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   I'll get paid in five days.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.760]   I'm like, no, no, no.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.320]   We only want to deal with money that is on hand.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.280]   So if you do those two things, you forget history and you only decide to budget the
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   money that you have on hand in the moment.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.680]   Suddenly that big financial plan that looked really scary.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.800]   It's nothing like that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's just, hey, I have $800 in my checking account.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.480]   200 needs to go to groceries.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.400]   150 needs to go to this bill.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   70 for my cell phone.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.160]   You know, it's very clear.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   It's amazing how many times we walk people through this hundreds of thousands of
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.200]   people, and at the end of that simple five minute exercise, they will often say, oh
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.960]   my gosh, I feel so much more in control already.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.720]   And we're like, that is a budget.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   A budget is control.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.520]   It's awareness.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.280]   It's intention.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.000]   And you only get intention by looking at money actually on hand.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.400]   And you only have that intention going, going forward.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.240]   Well, you would have saved me countless hours of arguments with my wife because
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.680]   my version of budgeting that, you know, like dieting just totally went by the
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.560]   wayside and never to be repeated in our house was at the end of every year, we
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.600]   said, okay, let's download our mint history of every transaction.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.720]   Let's categorize it all.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.200]   Let's see how much we're spending.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.360]   And the reason I did that, and I'm curious if you think it's not
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.520]   valuable, if there's an alternative was, you know, it helped me say, okay, I make
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.440]   X, I spend Y, I'm okay.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.480]   Like I'm what I'm doing today works.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.560]   And that actually freed me up to say, if I just keep doing what I'm doing, I'm
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.320]   probably okay and I don't need to be thinking about it every day because last
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.680]   year I did.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.160]   Okay.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.520]   But it was a lot of work, you know, if you just look at the money you have today
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.280]   and what its purpose is, is there any easy way to get a sense of, I don't know
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.200]   how much I'm saving this year or, uh, kind of some of those more macro ideas.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.360]   The macro is interesting because it can give you an idea of, I don't know what
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.000]   happened, what may happen again.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.080]   The New York times ran an article years ago that still kind of makes me mad
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.080]   because they were, they came off as, as, um, this light bulb moment they were,
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.120]   they were saying, Hey, on, you know, if on annual budgets, people tend to stay
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   within an annual budget, that was their point.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.720]   And, and I just was shaking my head.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.840]   Like an annual budget is not where mistakes are made.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.320]   Mistakes are made on the Saturday and Sunday between two paychecks.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.640]   That's when the mistakes were made.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.160]   So what we're talking about is like, when I look at your, the Hutchins
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.040]   household, like macro view, I'm like, yeah, on average, they're good.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   And most people, when they come to us, they're like, I don't get it.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.480]   I make good money.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   Like, why aren't I getting ahead?
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.960]   What's the deal here?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.200]   And it's not because of the macro level, they aren't looking okay.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.600]   It's because on January 22nd, they had purchased some really nice boots that
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.880]   they definitely wanted, and they're totally okay to buy boots, but on the
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.000]   23rd, they also had a life insurance premium come due and they're like,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.280]   oh, it was just a timing issue.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:44.720]   Right.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   And so, because there was a timing mismatch of money on hand and money
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.880]   required, they had to put a little bit on the card and most, you know, we know
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.480]   the average, you know, credit card balance for Americans.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.760]   It was honestly in 2020, it was just dropping like crazy much to the bank
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.280]   sphere, but we're heading right back where we were, you know, pre pandemic.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.480]   And so many of those swipes are just timing mismatches.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   It's like, I didn't have the resource, but I used to have the resource.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.880]   And what we want to have people do is just look ahead to those
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.680]   larger, less frequent expenses.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.840]   And then when you're debating whether or not you want to buy these boots, I
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   hate to use examples, Chris, because then people will be like, oh my gosh, Jesse
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.560]   doesn't think I should buy boots.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.920]   I really don't care.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.240]   You know, like what I do not care what you spend your money on.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.320]   I just want you to make sure that all your big expenses
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.120]   are taken care of as well.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.720]   So let's say you've got this insurance premium that's due in eight months.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.520]   You divide it by eight and you have a monthly insurance bill now that
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.360]   you're setting aside for, and the software does this, you know, that's
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.920]   that's the software part, but then you're also debating like, should
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.280]   I buy these boots or not now?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.120]   It's like, you have future Chris and current Chris that are at the
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.960]   negotiating table together and, and current Chris is like, I want the boots
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.240]   and future Chris is like, yeah, it's fine.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.640]   Cause you've been, you've set me up.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'll be good with the insurance payment or future.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.720]   Chris is like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.960]   Don't take, no, not yet.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.880]   Wait a little bit.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.360]   We have this due or future.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.400]   Chris is on the side of a road and he's a tow truck.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.040]   And it's like, come on, man, throw me a bone.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.360]   Like car repairs really happened.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.080]   They're really a thing.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.760]   It's the mismatch of when we have the money available so much of the
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.360]   time that gets us into trouble.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.040]   So I want people to pretend that they have like a future version of
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.760]   themselves that also has a say in what current money should be doing.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.880]   I like that.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.400]   I actually think sometimes budgeting is create a bunch of buckets and then
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.760]   see what happens with the money.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   And this is flipping it and it's see where the money is and then decide
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.080]   what needs to happen with it.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.880]   Yes.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.080]   In many ways, it's totally different from what anyone ever thinks of as budgeting.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.200]   So I'm curious, did you ever consider calling it something different?
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.480]   Oh yes.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.400]   And still like literally to this day, I'm like, should we rename, you know,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.920]   like we're this company called you need a budget and half of the country is just,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.240]   or world is like, oh my gosh, I will not give that guy the time of day.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.760]   And that kind of worries me, you know?
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.920]   Cause I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.640]   That's not what I meant.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.520]   It's not what I meant to say.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.240]   You know, I feel like I'm chasing after him trying to explain what
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   I really mean when I say budget.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.920]   So yeah, I've totally like from a purely like product guy to product guy.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.600]   I'm like, Hmm, is our name right?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.840]   You know, like there's, there's something there to that.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.640]   I don't know what I would name it, but, uh, every domain is taken now.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.080]   So if you have any ideas, let me know.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.440]   I mean, I at least liked it.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.360]   YNAB doesn't, you know, it could just be a name, right?
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   If you need a budget in its long form, obviously bring some kind of emotions
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.120]   out, but if you just call it just YNAB, it's it's you, maybe you don't think
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.680]   about the word budget out the gate.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.800]   I've also thought like, maybe, maybe we're trying to purposely exclude people
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.440]   that aren't ready to hear the news, you know?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.880]   So I don't know, but that's the marketer.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.560]   That's like always, always debating.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.400]   Like, is this, is this working or not?
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.600]   It's a pretty good filter.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   It gets a laugh when I tell people, yeah, I, you know, my company's name is you
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.760]   need a budget and they're like, uh, like nervous, you know, but, uh, everybody
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.200]   does regardless of income level.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.960]   I've tested it.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.280]   I've tested not having one and I make pretty good income and it wasn't, it
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.760]   wasn't good.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.120]   So everyone needs one.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.600]   So everyone, what would you say to the person that's saving on track for
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.080]   retirement, not using a budget and spending money and enjoying life and
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.720]   feeling like everything's working?
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.880]   What could a budget do for that person?
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.360]   I would argue this might be semantics.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.400]   I would argue that they already are budgeting.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.320]   It's just very high level.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.840]   So they've budgeted for savings.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.160]   They probably have an idea of what they want to spend on like large purchases,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   vacation, holiday spending, things like that.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.960]   And also they would naturally in this circumstance have to have lots of wiggle
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.360]   room because they need to have enough money where those timing issues don't
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:42.840]   pop up.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.480]   And that does take, that takes a good bit of income above your expenses.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.640]   I mean, there's a good gap of living within your means for people that don't
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.680]   deal with timing issues.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   I'm one of those people.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.920]   I don't deal with, with timing issues now.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.880]   You know, if you were to be like, Hey, eight of your big bills came at once.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.400]   I'd be like, Oh, that was uncomfortable, but.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.000]   We, it would be fine.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.280]   But most people, especially for the first while, as they're working the budget,
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.000]   they, they are definitely dealing with a timing problem.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   So I'm someone that's lucky enough to not have to budget so specifically that
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.240]   that's fine.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.520]   Their budget is optimized for their circumstance, but most people do not have
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.840]   that circumstance.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.720]   So I tested it in 20, was it 2020?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   Yeah, it was, it was just last year.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.720]   Cause I just ended it.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.160]   I tested doing a very high level budget for me and Julie.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.240]   And like we had an other category that was just massive.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   And I would just update once a month and be like, did checking account go up or
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.400]   down?
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.480]   And I would make an adjustment and then budget money.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.880]   And I lost thousands and thousands of dollars somehow.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   I don't know what we spent, but like for the first time in seven years, our
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.520]   checking account didn't stay at this level that it's like boring how it just
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.120]   stays there for the first time in like years after 2020.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.320]   And it wasn't because of the pandemic.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.040]   Cause we didn't eat out.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.640]   We didn't travel.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.000]   Like there was some things going for us to make that number go up.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.280]   It was interesting.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.480]   Cause yeah, money was gone.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.960]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, first time in so many years that our checking account
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.200]   is down probably 18, 25%.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.800]   And I couldn't say why.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.640]   And it might be the recovering accountant in me that just is really bothered by not
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.000]   having the accountability for it.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.640]   But I did find it interesting without that awareness, without that intention,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.680]   like the money just kind of did what it did.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.600]   That's fascinating.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.720]   If you ever find out what happened to it, let us know.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.840]   Maybe it's in that unclaimed money stuff.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.000]   Like maybe that in that hack that, you know, you talk about with unclaimed money
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.720]   that they're like, oh my gosh, Jesse's unclaimed money is with the state of Utah.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.640]   He just doesn't know it.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.440]   So I don't know what happened to it.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:48.120]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.920]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.440]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.000]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.040]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.240]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.640]   37,000.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.160]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.520]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.080]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.400]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.600]   25.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.760]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.040]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.320]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.920]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.360]   system with one source of truth.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.280]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.640]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.440]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   Allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.640]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.360]   is actually so good for you.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.120]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.120]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.000]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.080]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.520]   250-year-old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.280]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.640]   toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.760]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.120]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.360]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.080]   Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.200]   digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.840]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.480]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.760]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.200]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.040]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.000]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.400]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.200]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.280]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.840]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.240]   Now, I noticed one interesting thing.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.320]   When you say, you know, the company, it's YNAB, you need a budget.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.920]   You're not saying you need YNAB as a customer and software, like you don't
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.320]   think it's for everyone, but you think the process of budgeting is, and you're
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.200]   willing to share how you guys do it.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.600]   Could you talk a little bit about the difference between this kind of style of
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.560]   budgeting you've created and the company and the software?
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.440]   Yeah, we teach four rules.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.160]   We teach to give every dollar a job.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.960]   And we mentioned that already, like only money you have on hand, not money you're
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.040]   going to get, and you're facing forward.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.520]   What jobs will this money do?
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   The second rule, we call it embracing your true expenses, which means
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.040]   Christmas is a true expense.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.480]   Like Christmas is a monthly bill.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.360]   Car repairs are monthly bills.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.520]   They just don't come that way.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.520]   But as you start to take large, less frequent expenses, break
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.880]   them up into monthly amounts.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.600]   You can see that your real expenses aren't just cable, groceries, and all
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.800]   those like monthly standard stuff.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   That's rule two.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   So you have rule one and rule two, where you're giving every dollar a job,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.920]   including future you in this equation.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.000]   Rule three is to change your mind.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.400]   We call it rolling with the punches.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   But it's just like when life happens, you end up having visitors come to the house.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.920]   You have to catch a flight somewhere for an emergency.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.360]   Life happens.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.200]   And, and so you need to be able to adjust the budget as needed.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.440]   A lot of people think budgeting is like, I don't know, like it's just set in
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.080]   stone and rigid budgets, they, they break.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.240]   And so we, one of our rules is to be flexible.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.440]   You're, you're more like a, a coach making adjustments to how the
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.520]   opponents are playing all the time.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.480]   Versus just being some clairvoyant person that can guess and predict
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.280]   every single spending move you'll make.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.000]   Our fourth rule is called age your money.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.400]   And it's essentially the idea that when you follow the first three rules, you
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.040]   will get to a point where the money you're spending today, you earned
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.760]   30, 40, 50, a hundred days ago.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.520]   It's people that you mentioned, Chris, earlier on that have that
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.200]   pretty good slush in their budget.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.520]   They'll have an age of money that is far higher because they aren't
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.640]   living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.080]   And so our fourth rule is basically a metric that the software tracks that
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.920]   tells you like how close to that paycheck to paycheck edge are you?
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.040]   So I mentioned those four rules in brief.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.800]   We dive into them with classes and podcasts, everything under the sun
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.320]   to teach people those four rules, because it's, it's about how
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.840]   you're thinking about the money.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.800]   And then you can run off to mint or what, yeah, you could probably do it
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240]   with mint or your own spreadsheet.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.440]   Like this whole company came about because I started it with a spreadsheet.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.960]   So I would never fault someone for building their own.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.440]   You can run it with ledger paper that your grandma might have in
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.240]   like an old drawer or something.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.760]   Like there are places where you could run the method and you don't need to
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.680]   worry about the software.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.360]   Our software is killer best in the business.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.520]   But for some reason, if someone's like, Oh, I I'd like to roll my own.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.760]   I mean, my word, go for it.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.720]   You know, there are enough people that will buy our software.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   I'm not too worried about it.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.760]   Are there specific things that software does that you think are worth calling
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.600]   out that makes it hard to do on your own or things like that tracking that age of
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.440]   money number, which now I'm sitting here like, ah, I want to track that.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.520]   That seems like a good metric.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.880]   It's a, well, one thing on your phone, I mean, the apps on your phone, obviously,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.080]   and on the web and all of that it's with Alexa, you could ask Alexa, how much is
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.800]   in your grocery category, but she'll tell your friends and neighbors to like, you
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.400]   have to be careful.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.880]   She's not like super discreet.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.680]   So you, you know, on your phone, like I can be in home Depot and go to add a
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.200]   transaction and the phone recognizes like, Oh, Jesse's in home Depot.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.680]   Last time you were, you know, he put this as home maintenance cause I'm buying air
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.640]   filters or something.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.200]   And so it like pre-populates all of that.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.120]   It's, it's like a two second thing.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.960]   Um, you could probably build some kind of a Google form that route to like a
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.160]   spreadsheet of your own and maybe get smart and do something like that as well.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   But the phone itself just on the go is dynamite.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.680]   You can share it with your spouse or partner, and then you are both on the same
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.120]   page.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.160]   And so, you know, you and your wife are like, Hey, how much do we have to, to work
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   within two different categories?
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   And you can both make decisions independent of each other that will be totally
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.400]   appropriate and fine.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.760]   And then, you know, monthly you can get together and kind of make your plan.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.880]   So the sharing of information we've nailed, and then the obviously grabbing bank
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:02.440]   transactions, that is a quagmire of politics and tech and like old tubes of old
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:02.760]   banks.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.840]   Like it's a mess of a place, but we do our absolute best and I don't want to give
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.200]   away the farm, but we use multiple providers.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.440]   We do very smart things behind the scenes to make sure that we're really trying to
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.760]   give the best experience we can.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.360]   And so for users just to be able to pull in their bank transactions and catch those
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.320]   that they didn't do on their phone, that's something that would be real tough, real
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.360]   tough to build on your own.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   So much so that I think paying the annual fee for us might, as far as hacks go,
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.080]   might be a pretty good hack at that point, you know, so I don't know.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.600]   And how much time do you think a YNAB user can get to needing to spend on
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   budgeting each week or month or day?
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.960]   Yeah, I, at this year, I do experiments every year.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.440]   2020 was my experiment of basically no budgeting.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.240]   The year before I did an experiment where I was all manual.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.600]   I didn't connect to any bank accounts.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.320]   Every morning I would sit down and literally type in each
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   transaction from the prior day.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.040]   You know, we've got a big family, seven kids, and we got some churn in the
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.360]   house as far as transactions go, but it took me, it was a little ritual.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   It was like a five minute thing each morning.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.120]   And, you know, staying on top of it daily was, was dynamite for as far
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.560]   as like behavior change goes.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.680]   For anyone that's saying, I'm kind of a little bit of a train wreck.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.080]   I would like to do this better.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.600]   The more frequent visiting of your budget is key because we're
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.000]   trying to get behavior change.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.360]   But if things are on autopilot, I do it like weekly on my phone,
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.080]   sitting somewhere, you know, lazily.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.920]   And I'm just going through and categorizing and I think probably an
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.040]   hour a month on kind of maintenance.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.680]   I'm, I'm pretty good at it, but I mean, I'd like to think so.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   I'm not like trying to go fast or anything.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.920]   It's just, it's pretty, pretty straightforward.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.160]   So now I will say my, my finances are very, very simple.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.880]   I have one credit card, one checking account.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.000]   I'm not trying to manage my entire financial life.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.760]   We're just trying to manage our inflows and outflows.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.480]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.560]   I mean, sitting in the line at a grocery store, scrolling through Instagram, you
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.360]   know, those small bits of time is probably, you could use it like this.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.800]   You don't need one hour sitting straight at a computer.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.600]   You can kind of do it in pieces throughout the month.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.920]   Is that, give us a little bit of your Instagram time.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.480]   That's what I'll, that's, that's going to be a hook now.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.320]   Just like, can we have 10 minutes of your Instagram time each week?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.280]   I think we can do this.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.880]   And I love that you are, are building a company around convenience.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.800]   I know something we've done at Wealthfront is like, look, if you want a
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.840]   portfolio, we'll give it to you.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.440]   Uh, we're not trying to make a secret out of how we invest your money.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.960]   The value we offer is that we make it easier, faster, and more
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.000]   convenient to do what you want to do.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.760]   And if you don't want that, you know, come here, read our blog, look at our articles.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.320]   So I love that you guys have a similar approach to focusing the value on making
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.960]   life convenient and doing it at what I think is a very reasonable price to pay
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.720]   to get back the time it would take to use a grandma's ledger paper.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.640]   You said you have seven children.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.960]   I've one child and there's a lot of costs, seven, obviously, hopefully
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.840]   you get some economies of scale, but running a family that big, are there
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.360]   things you've had to do or, or hacks you've had to introduce to your life,
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.280]   your spending, et cetera, to make everything run more smoothly?
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.240]   So obviously hand-me-downs become much more valuable when there's
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.640]   like a downline for kids.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.520]   So you got to do the hand-me-down thing that goes without saying
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.640]   you store those clothes.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.760]   I mean, there are tiny things like we don't fold laundry at all ever.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.080]   Because more, I feel like that, that might sound like a crazy thing to people.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.840]   We have photos of the kids folding their laundry and we would all be in a big
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.280]   basket and we'd be in the living room.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.920]   And I snapped a photo from years ago when they were probably like six, four, two
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.360]   and zero or something like that.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.400]   It was a big chore every week, like a huge chore.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.480]   And the kids hated it.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.440]   And so now we teach them to use the washer really, really early.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   And it's super easy.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.000]   And the dryer's just as easy.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.760]   And then as soon as they can reach the soap, it's like, okay,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.800]   you're old enough to do this.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.160]   They put in their own load.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.280]   They change it over.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.400]   Julie will harp on them like, Hey, change it over.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.600]   Hey, go change over the laundry.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.040]   Hey, go, you know, she does that.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.880]   But then they just drag it back down to their rooms.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.000]   And that's the end of us caring about laundry.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.880]   And I know they don't fold it independently.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.200]   Like, I know I'm not lying right now.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.840]   You know, like we just, we don't fold.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.400]   Even you, your shirts just thrown in the drawer unfolded or?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.800]   I mean, I fold, but I, it's like, for me, it's like, it takes me five minutes.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.520]   You know, I'm like, this is nothing, but to manage it for seven people, I'm like,
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.760]   you know what, you know what, well, you have a one-year-old what it's like to
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.640]   fold like a one-year-old onesie.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.200]   You're like, this thing is so small.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.760]   Like, what are we doing here?
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.320]   So yeah, that's, that story ended a long time ago.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.160]   We just, it saves so much time not folding laundry.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.120]   It's unbelievable.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.400]   And the kids don't care.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.120]   They don't care.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.200]   If the onesie is a little wrinkled, it's like not a big deal.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.560]   Come on.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.560]   They're not going to important business meetings.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.200]   What about food?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.520]   How do you manage meals for a household of nine?
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.000]   So we don't do leftovers.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.560]   Cause there is nothing left over.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.960]   You know, people will say like, Oh, you know, cook on Saturday and make
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.760]   like all of your lunches or do like make all of it.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.040]   I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.160]   We need like a commercial kitchen to knock that out.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.120]   Like it, so we, we, the leftover thing isn't a hack for us.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.240]   I have noticed some, a few small things.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:20.760]   Um, well, one is we, we'd never put the food on the table because to have seven
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.720]   tiny voices and some that sound like man children now, but like to have those
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.600]   people be like, Hey, it's past this.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.000]   And like, they won't use the person's name.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.600]   It'll just be like, pass this, pass the salt, pass it.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.160]   And like, it's just this cacophony of past this.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.080]   And then it's going to be like, Hey, I asked three times or like someone grabs
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   it before they pass it and they take some, and then someone else gets upset.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.800]   Cause they, it's called a shortstop, Chris.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.560]   I don't know if you've dealt with that, but if someone, you know,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.800]   intercepts it, it's a shortstop.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.040]   And you're like, Oh my gosh, we cannot do this.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.080]   This like, we can't converse and we're big on dinner.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.520]   Like we're big on eating together.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.800]   Like that talk about life hacks.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   I feel like that's like top three.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.040]   It's like eat dinner together as a family.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.600]   Like, it's just so it's like this great touchstone for you.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.440]   So I don't want to throw dinner out.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.280]   So we bring all the food over to the Island, leave it off the
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.400]   table and it's all buffet style.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.000]   And that, that helps tremendously.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.040]   The other thing that like, even gosh, tinier hacks, like Julie and I, when
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   we're plating the kid's food, because that's faster than having tiny
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.160]   hands using large spoons, we years ago decided we would lay all the plates
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.080]   out, like top to bottom, left to right age order.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.480]   So I would always be bottom right.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.120]   And Julie's just next to me, you know?
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.240]   And when we would have guests, this is what's funny.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.720]   I like, if you were over at our house, Chris, I'd be like, Chris, how old are
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:32.880]   you?
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.600]   And maybe you say like, I don't know, you're 39 or something.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.720]   I'm guessing I'd be like, oh, well, you're younger than me, but you're older than
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   Julie.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.600]   So I would stick you between me and Julie.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.800]   Like we're very, like we, we stick with the age thing, even when we have guests
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.160]   over, but that helped me and Julie not have to be like, who's plate is this?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.920]   Who's plate is that?
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.280]   You know?
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.960]   And because you're, you're portioning.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.400]   Proportionate to the mass of the individual.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.760]   And it's, you know, there's, there's a big variation until dessert comes.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.840]   And then for some reason, the proportions don't matter anymore to those little
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.160]   kids.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.240]   They're like, why isn't my piece as big as that kid?
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.440]   That's four times my size.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.080]   You know, you have to explain it.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.960]   We've discussed growth rates and things, but it's still a fight.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.800]   So, yeah, can't figure it out, but yeah, those are a few it's a, it's a fun, I
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.480]   mean, there's, it's always lively, you know, can I give you another one on the
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.200]   family stuff?
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.920]   Absolutely.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.280]   I, uh, you know, dinner was one that's like family together time.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   And I know you're big on like intentionally making sure relationships are
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:25.480]   solid.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.760]   Another one that I love, I call it parlor time with the kids and the parlor is an
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.800]   old room, you know, that people don't know about anymore, but like the parlor was
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.000]   where the family would go when like the day's work was done and maybe there
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.520]   wasn't even electricity or something.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.440]   And it's this very romanticized idea.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.240]   And I probably have cattle at that point.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.440]   And you know, like there's a lot going on in my head with parlor time, but at the
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.520]   end of the day, it's where we all sit and I tell the kids, you can read, you can
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.040]   play a game with someone, but we're all in this room.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.240]   Like you can do whatever you want, but we're all in this room, obviously no
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.720]   screens, like that would kind of suck someone away.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.360]   And I love parlor time.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.120]   So you'll have kids that are, uh, you know, sitting there playing a game.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.400]   Lot, my kids are readers.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.440]   A lot of them will read.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.800]   I, at that point, I love the reading and you just have all your kids kind of in
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.560]   that little spot for a little bit of time, 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.480]   That feels good.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.840]   That's one of my favorite acts.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.600]   No, no.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.840]   It just, I mean, honestly, it's just like, I call for it.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.480]   Sometimes like guys were doing parlor time and you know, like sometimes there's
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.880]   a little bit of groaning, but everyone comes up and they'll have something that
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.440]   they can do.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.400]   It's mostly for like Sundays where things are a little more chill already.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.160]   And, uh, I love it.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:31.920]   Love that.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.440]   So the kids like it too, once they settle in, you know, if we go back in time a
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.640]   little bit, how did you end up, uh, becoming the, the YNAB guy?
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.760]   Like the, the guy who's like, I love budgeting.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.920]   I start a company telling people they need a budget.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.320]   What's the origin of that story?
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.640]   I wish I had some grand vision of entrepreneurial, you know, I don't
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.560]   know, swagger or something, but it was nothing of the sort.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.880]   I, Julie and I were married pretty young and then scraping, you know,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.560]   making 10 bucks an hour in school.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.040]   I had three years of school to get my master's in accountancy.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.680]   She wrapped up her schooling, but it was in social work.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.960]   So her full-time job, she was making $11 an hour.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.680]   And we were actually pretty thrilled with that.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.160]   You know, we're like, oh my gosh, 11 bucks.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.000]   This isn't too bad.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.760]   Rent was 350 bucks a month, including some of our utilities.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.080]   Like, you know, we lived on the cheap, which I know you can appreciate,
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.360]   but we wanted to have a baby.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.000]   And so when the baby was coming, Julie also wanted to be able
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.760]   to step out of the workforce.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.560]   She's just like, I just want to focus on this baby, new mom,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.240]   you know, obviously new baby.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.760]   And so that was a big deal for us.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   The other big deal for us was we didn't want to borrow money for school.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.160]   I had a little scholarship that helped with tuition some.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.480]   And I kept crunchy numbers.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.280]   Like, how can I, can I work more hours?
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.040]   But my accounting program already really frowned on lots of work.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.560]   So I was working more than what they allowed even, and I just
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.720]   couldn't squeeze out any more.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.960]   And at least not structured in that way.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.040]   And so we had been using a spreadsheet that I had built for just the two of us.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.680]   And it had worked well.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.400]   Like we had gotten some savings together and we just weren't going to be able to
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.160]   get those last two years without borrowing.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.200]   And I was kind of mad because I'm like, man, we've been budgeting.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.320]   We can't live any more cheaply than we are.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.560]   And it wasn't going to be enough.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.280]   And so I had this just kind of crazy, a little bit egotistical idea.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.720]   I was like, Oh, maybe, maybe people would just buy this spreadsheet from me.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.360]   And so I launched with a spreadsheet, like, you know, September of '04 launched
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:37.120]   and sold little bits at a time, enough to keep the interest of me.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.600]   And then in February of '05, I discovered that the spreadsheet had enforced rules
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.320]   that I hadn't known were there.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.600]   And so I turned it around and started talking about the rules and a lot less
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.400]   about the spreadsheet and our sales doubled and then doubled again.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.040]   And I mean, doubled like, you know, 500 to a thousand, a thousand to 2000, it
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.280]   wasn't crazy number, but that was enough for me to think, Oh, the rules are kind
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.520]   of the key here, the spreadsheets kind of second fiddle.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.200]   And then I met a guy named Taylor, who's now my business partner.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.680]   And he said, Hey, I can improve the spreadsheet.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.680]   I'm a developer.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.360]   And I said, no, how about just real software?
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:12.960]   You know?
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   And he said, I can do that too.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:19.600]   So we launched the first like windows only, like paste in your license key
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.360]   type software back in the day.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.280]   We launched that had never met each other in person and launched that at the end of
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:32.040]   '06, by that time I was a CPA and doing my CPA thing for about 10 months before I
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.720]   realized I do not like doing this.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.680]   And I really liked this little side gig, the side hustle, you know, and I was
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.760]   making more from my side hustle than I was from my CPA job.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.600]   So it still took me a little bit of time to get up the guts and realize that I
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.840]   could support a family on my own business.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.440]   Only years later, do you realize that there's no super secure way to make money.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.360]   Like there's always risk of things, but yeah, that was kind of the Genesis.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.480]   And we've just iterated on that little old spreadsheet since then.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:04.320]   So now that, you know, the spreadsheet died, gosh, 15 years ago, but, uh, the
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.880]   software just keeps getting better and better.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.840]   And I think we keep getting better and better at teaching people how to think
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.880]   differently about their money.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.160]   So it's, yeah, it's been a fun business to run.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.360]   It's been fun to see people make changes.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.640]   You know, that like, they'll write and be like, Oh, our marriage is better.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.080]   Or I took this, I took a job that had a pay cut, but the job is way better.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.920]   And it's like stuff like that, where you're like, man.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.640]   And then they're like, my family life is better.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.200]   You're like, how do you put a price tag on that type of win for somebody?
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:29.560]   You know?
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   So it's, it's a fun business to, to be involved in.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.360]   Do any of those stories include cool ways people have managed to uplevel their
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.720]   finances outside of just, you know, budgeting hacks they've learned or shared
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.600]   or things they've done?
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.200]   I'll give one.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.840]   I mean, this might be obvious and this is maybe too close to budgeting to be
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.400]   appreciated by your audience perhaps.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:55.760]   But the biggest hack of all is when you realize that some of your money has been
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.560]   doing things you don't actually value, like that, that, and it's like the, it's
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.000]   like a, it's a high level optimization you're doing there.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.280]   And so the budget at the end of the day is a tool to let you know that your money
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.240]   is, is going toward the things you value.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.320]   We spent all this time, like hacking our careers, you know, like making sure that
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.080]   we're making the most, that we love our job.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.760]   We've gone to school and then we're like day to day, we're getting up early.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.080]   We're like grinding, we're adding value.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.760]   We, we put all of this energy into the time to money creation, right?
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.200]   Where we're converting our time into money.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:34.360]   As soon as the money is in our hands, for some reason, so many people don't just
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.320]   extend that effort a little bit further and say, okay, now that it's money, how
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.000]   do I optimize it to be in line with what I truly care about?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.920]   They stopped.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.600]   They've optimized their career like crazy.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.320]   They're killing it.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.520]   They're high performing, but then it's become money.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.080]   And they're like, oh, I'm not a money person or whatever that, I hate that.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.000]   You know, we, I want people to just extend a little bit of effort a little
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.440]   further along, like take a surgeon, for example, someone who's just like high
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.920]   performer, you know, saving people's lives every day.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.840]   And then there's like, oh, I'm not good with money.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.200]   I'm like, come on, man, you replace someone's heart.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.400]   Like you're good.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.480]   You're good at anything you decide to attack with that brain of yours.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.040]   So like, you're good with money.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.400]   You're good with whatever, just, you just got to learn how to make sure that
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.800]   it's doing what you really care about.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.040]   That's the biggest hack of all.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.680]   Of course, in our forums, in our Reddit, like we have an awesome subreddit.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.120]   Our Facebook fans group is, they're the ones where you can go and then be like,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.960]   hey, everyone, you know, I got this health insurance bill, totally caught me off
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.440]   guard and people will be like, oh, I can tell you a story.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.320]   Here's what you can do.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.520]   So our community is full of them.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.960]   But for me, I, I just focus on that big one.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.840]   Money, priorities, perfectly in alignment, magic.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.000]   That's great.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.280]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.560]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.120]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.200]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.680]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.920]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy their
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.480]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.000]   coffee.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.200]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.000]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.440]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.600]   it.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.120]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.680]   last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.600]   Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.120]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.600]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.680]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.240]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.760]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:02.680]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.840]   up your cooking at home?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.320]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.720]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.520]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.840]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   this episode.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.840]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.280]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.840]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.080]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.840]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.240]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.600]   too.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.840]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.280]   It is so good.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.080]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black IO Collection they launched last
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.840]   year, you have to check it out.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:03.600]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.040]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.160]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.000]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.360]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.160]   And outside of budgeting in your own life, are there things you're doing with savings
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.000]   investing that, you know, what does that world look like for you?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.920]   So one that I found that's kind of like a nerdy, I like just heard about recently.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.960]   I mean, you're, you're familiar with like the Roth, like the mega backdoor Roth type
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.400]   stuff that people will be able to get tax-free growth.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.600]   I'm in a tax bracket where the Roth isn't available to me anymore.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.440]   And we did this deal with our 401k when we switched providers and they have a, they
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.520]   have a setup where you can contribute after-tax money to your 401k and immediately
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.360]   convert it to a Roth.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.120]   And so there's no gain on that after-tax money.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.520]   There's no growth gain that you would then have to actually pay taxes on because
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.720]   they've converted immediately.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.520]   So we went from being able to save, what is it?
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   19.5 or something.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.680]   Um, I can put away like pre-tax.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.320]   I can go all the way up to, I think 50 grand that difference, uh, for after-tax
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.960]   and then convert it to a Roth.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.880]   So I can get in to a Roth, even though I am technically allowed, but I'm, but I'm
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.160]   not easily allowed.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.240]   And, uh, so that was one that like just this year, I discovered a lot of, a lot of
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.960]   our employees at YNAB jumped on that, um, trying to, you know, maximize that savings
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.560]   that they can get.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.800]   So you get this tax-free growth.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.280]   Then later on down the road, we're talking years later.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.800]   I now have this tax-free money that I can use and strategically time with
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.200]   deductions and other things.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.280]   It gives you room to maneuver and make your income go up or down as needed, you
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.480]   know, to optimize your tax bill.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.640]   So that was one that, yeah, there's two, two, two things I'll tack on that.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.520]   So yeah, look, if your employer offers it, there's something called the mega
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.320]   backdoor Roth.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.720]   If your employer doesn't, and you're not eligible for Roth, you could still do a
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.640]   backdoor Roth.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.120]   And, you know, I would say Google around.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.160]   There's a lot of things to be careful of.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.840]   If you already have a lot of traditional IRA assets, it can be a real tax problem.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.080]   But if you don't have an IRA at all, and you're not eligible to contribute to your
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.840]   Roth, you can contribute after-tax money to just a traditional Roth and roll it
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.320]   over.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.240]   Or if your employer allows, and the question to ask is, do you allow me to
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.560]   make after-tax contributions to my IRA and do, I think it's called an in-plan
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.080]   rollover, but if you just Google mega backdoor Roth, there's so much stuff out
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.000]   there, it's really cool and lets you really boost your retirement savings.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.040]   The other thing, if you build up a really big Roth IRA balance, if you're already
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.480]   set for retirement or you're already saving enough to be on track and you have
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.680]   enough and you want to take a little bit of risk, something that people don't often
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.880]   realize is, you know, we say, look, if you want to take risk in your investment
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.760]   portfolio, let's keep that to like 10% or less, and you could go pick stocks or you
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.480]   could invest in crypto and that kind of stuff.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.760]   Well, it turns out that a lot of those risky things, uh, you know, are high risk,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.920]   high return, and most people do them in their taxable account, but if you search
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.240]   around online, there's a handful of companies that let you do self-directed
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.280]   IRA investing, which means you can start to do some of those risky things in your
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.520]   IRA, which I will give this huge caveat.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   They're like, this is only if you're on track for retirement, otherwise, like you
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.720]   should not be risking your retirement money.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.880]   Uh, but if you're on track for retirement, you can actually self-direct your IRA
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.280]   and use that to invest in stocks or invest in cryptocurrency or invest in
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.160]   things that are higher risk, higher return.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.880]   And if you Google around, there's a handful of people that have been doing
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.840]   this who have tens of millions of dollars in their IRA, which based on
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.480]   contribution limits seems impossible, but because they were using their
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.240]   IRA to make the more risky bets.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.960]   So I'd say if you've already decided, I can take some risky bets with this amount
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.000]   of money and, and you're diligent about saving for your future, you could use
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.480]   your IRA to lower your tax bill.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.080]   If those risky bets pay off.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.480]   There's another one kind of speaking to the people that maybe haven't maxed out
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.000]   their kind of plain vanilla retirement.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.880]   Like I should, I should tell everyone just out of the gate, I'm
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.720]   allocated like a 90 year old grandma.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.760]   Like I am, I'm in bonds up to my ears because my business is such a risky
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.600]   venture, right?
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.520]   Like all of my, my work and net worth is tied up in this business essentially.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.360]   So everything else is very, very safe and, and that's appropriate.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.600]   But for those people that are maybe not caught up on retirement or they're
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.440]   feeling like they can't find the money.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:47.400]   I introduced years ago on my podcast, the idea of what I call the 1% rule.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.000]   And then something about the 1% in politics started coming out, like
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.280]   that, that started to become a phrase.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.320]   And so I was like, Oh man, I just got to name it something else.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:00.480]   But regardless of that, the idea is that every quarter you increase your
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.920]   retirement contribution by 1% and the next quarter you do it again.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.520]   And the next quarter you do it again.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.160]   And we're exercising the pay yourself first muscle, just no matter where you're
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.800]   at, whether you're saving 10% now or zero, just do 1%.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:21.440]   I've had several people run that for now four years and they've just kept doing it.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.080]   And after a while, if you do that math really quickly, you know, five years in
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.920]   you're saving 20% of your income.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.880]   And I would encourage people to just bump it a percent and see if you don't make due,
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.520]   you know, see if it doesn't just work itself out, it, it will.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.320]   So that that's one little hack.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.200]   That's like out of sight, out of mind.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.760]   Every quarter you could even tell your employer, if you have a cool,
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.280]   like a cool payroll office, they could potentially do this for you where you
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.240]   just say, Hey, I would like it to be raised 1% and then next quarter 1%.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.640]   I will not come back and ask you.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.400]   I just want you to do this for me.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.240]   Here's my signed piece of paper or whatever that says you can.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.960]   And then, um, set it on pure autopilot because it's interesting when we don't
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.560]   know what has happened and when we aren't in our way, we can make really good
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.160]   decisions.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.520]   And so it's a step beyond just being automatically defaulted into a 401k.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.320]   And we're automatically increasing that rate and just see if you don't die.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.680]   You know, I think it'll work out.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.760]   I love that.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.800]   I mean, automation is so easy when it comes to saving nowadays.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.960]   Like I think about what parents and grandparents had to do to automate their
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.880]   savings and write checks and move money.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:32.280]   And now it's never been easier to say, sweep this money before I get to think
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.360]   about it before I get to spend it and put that away.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.120]   So, yeah.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.960]   And, and I love that your kind of investment portfolio is so boring.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.840]   I feel very similarly, and I keep talking to people who have been very
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.600]   successful and most people's investment portfolios are kind of boring because
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.840]   they're doing, taking a lot of risk with their work or their business, or maybe
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.120]   their job's really boring and they take a little bit more risk, uh, with
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.560]   investing, but I think too often there's the hype of, you know, getting in on the
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.240]   next meme stock and all of that.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.920]   And everyone assumes that that's how everyone's making money.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.720]   And I'm like, no, I just have some diverse passive, uh, index funds and I'm
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.120]   just, you know, spending my free time thinking about things that could level
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.400]   myself up like you did starting this business.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.520]   I mean, I do a little bit of risky for fun entertainment type.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.840]   Uh, I wouldn't even call it investing.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.880]   It's like, I'm not going to call it gambling, but it's somewhere in the,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.760]   between those two.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.720]   And that's purely for fun and to chat about with my buddies, you know, but
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.600]   yeah, everything else, it's the, uh, 90 year old grandmother that goes to a
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.120]   bridge game.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.720]   That's my asset allocation.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.440]   That's awesome.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.160]   Any other hacks, tips, things you've learned in the space worth sharing?
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:46.960]   Oh man, I live a pretty regimented life in the sense that I wake up to an alarm
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.720]   clock and I get going first thing.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.680]   And I exercise first.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.480]   I feel like that's a hack for me that helps tons.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.040]   I eat the same thing for breakfast six out of seven days because you know, you
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.280]   just start to kind of find that you don't want to keep recreating the will.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.880]   I wear the same hat all the time.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.840]   You know, the, uh, it's, it's interesting because if you were to probably, if I
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.160]   were to like follow myself around for a day, I'd be like, Oh wait, that is
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.720]   interesting.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.960]   I've given up a few, you know, over the years I used to have everyone turn off
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.560]   lights and be like the lights are, you know, like kids turn off your lights.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.240]   Cause I grew up dealing with 60 watt bulbs.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.960]   Like it did make a difference, but now, you know, you've got two watt bulbs and
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.280]   I'm like, I don't know if I should keep harping on the lights thing, you know, I
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.920]   think, and now you start installing switches to turn off lights when you leave
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.640]   rooms anyway.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.760]   So there are things that I've ended up just not caring about as I've gotten a
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.200]   little older, things have changed.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.000]   But, um, I like my family hacks.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.360]   I, if I were to end on one, it'd be the dinner one.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.000]   Try and make dinner happen with the kids.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.680]   You know, if you don't have kids, just have dinner happen with your significant
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:49.880]   other.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.680]   Like it's, it's just a quieter time, you know, don't watch TV during dinner.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.560]   Obviously don't pull your phones out during dinner.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.680]   Obviously just eat slowly and chew your food 35 times or whatever that number is
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.480]   that people say is good.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   And, uh, yeah, converse a little bit slow down.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.400]   I think that's done wonders for our family over the last 18 years.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.520]   That's awesome.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.400]   We try to do that, uh, with the kid every day and then without the kid once a week.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.240]   Uh, yes.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.040]   The weekly date.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.400]   That's a killer relationship hack.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.160]   We do that as well.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.800]   Like religious about that thing.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.560]   Weekly date.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.200]   Cool.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.400]   Well, where do you want people to find you online and everything you're working on?
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:30.040]   So if you liked my voice, the you need a budget podcast, you know, YNAB is
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.160]   available on, on all the iTunes, Spotify, all that, um, you need a budget.com.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.560]   If you're in a hurry, YNAB.com, we got that four letter domain years ago.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.240]   And so you can type that in quickly.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.360]   I'm not on the social stuff, so anyone can email me.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.960]   Um, there's a hat, Chris.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.200]   I'm not on any social stuff.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.320]   So, um, but, uh, yeah, you can email me Jesse@ynab.com and, uh, I'm happy to
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.840]   write back, uh, Mondays and Thursdays or when I jump back into email.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.120]   So cool.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.520]   Well, thank you so much for being here.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.600]   Absolutely.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.920]   That was amazing.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.560]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.760]   If you want to check out YNAB, I'm trying to get a special offer set
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.840]   up at all the hacks.com/ynab.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:13.320]   So head there if you're interested and to everyone who's been writing in to share
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.960]   ideas, ask questions or offer to help out with the show.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.200]   Thank you so much.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.360]   I love hearing from listeners and I try to write back to everyone as soon as I can.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.640]   I know I'm a little overdue right now, but I'm back from traveling.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.800]   So I'll be catching up soon.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.160]   Finally, if you're enjoying the show and want to help out, please consider sharing
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.280]   your favorite episode to a friend or family member.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.280]   See you next week.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:51.040]   I want to tell you about another podcast.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.520]   I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.280]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.440]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.320]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.400]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.680]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:16.000]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:16.720]   entertaining.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:22.240]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.400]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.320]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.960]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.600]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.560]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:43.320]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.800]   your money and grow your wealth.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.960]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:51.320]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.800]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
