[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.240]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.480]   hacks.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   Now, there aren't too many words I could use this early in a show that might
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.360]   send people running, but I'm going to use one today and I encourage you to
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.560]   fight that urge and stick around because I'm about to have an amazing
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640]   conversation about budgeting with Jesse Mecham, the founder of what many
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.000]   consider to be the best budgeting process and tool in the market today,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   YNAB, or You Need a Budget.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.360]   Jesse started this company as a side hustle back in 2004 and has bootstrapped
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.600]   it to a place where they now support over 100,000 customers in their
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.400]   financial lives.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.520]   He's also written a book on budgeting and hosts the YNAB podcast, and our
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.720]   conversation will talk about why budgeting gets such a bad rap.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.400]   In preview, lots of people might just be doing it wrong.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.720]   We'll talk about an approach to budgeting you could do in far less time
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.560]   than I used to spend categorizing every single one of my transactions, and
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.360]   hear about some of the hacks Jesse's picked up raising his family of seven
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.880]   children.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   Also, I'm going to try to get a special deal set up for listeners who want to
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.480]   try out YNAB, so check out allthehacks.com/YNAB.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.200]   Okay, and before we jump in, I always have to remind you, Chris Hutchins

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.280]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520]   Jesse, thanks for being here.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.480]   Absolutely.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.640]   So, you know, budgeting is such a charged topic.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.400]   I feel like people love it.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.040]   People hate it.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.680]   I'd love to get your take on just why is it so, so charged and, and is that
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   controversy justified?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.560]   I'll start with the second part.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.720]   Yes, it is justified.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.560]   I think it's totally justified to feel like budgeting means that you are never
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.640]   going to have fun again.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.320]   You know, like if you think budgeting is like dieting, it's like, I will never
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.520]   eat chocolate cake again.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.560]   Like that's a horrible way to live your life, you know, or worse, your spouse or
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.280]   partner wants to start budgeting and you're like, Oh no, no, no, I know what
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.840]   you're doing here.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.600]   Like there's so many scary things that are associated with the word budget only
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   because people have been for the most part doing it wrong, but we approach it.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.880]   The budget is your plan and it's yours.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.040]   It remains yours forever.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.280]   And so that's where, for me, I then can go out and play 18 holes because I said I
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.600]   could.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.880]   And so when I'm out playing, I'm mad about my swing or sad or feel guilty that I
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   spent money playing golf.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.600]   Like that's because I wanted to.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.560]   So budgeting lets you spend on what you want while not feeling guilty about it,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040]   whether or not you actually could afford it.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.200]   And we can unpack that if you want, but I don't blame people for hearing the word
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.680]   budget and kind of freaking out a little bit.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.480]   Not at all.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.120]   It's very, it's very common.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.720]   And if someone is that person there, they're like, Oh yeah, okay.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.960]   It's too good to be true.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.320]   What's the first thing you would tell them to try to come over to the dark side, I
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   guess, and realize that that budgeting maybe can be more freeing than it is
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.160]   restrictive.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.920]   Well, I can walk through like what, from what most people experience and you know,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.240]   you'll see something that you want and I don't want to, like when I say want, I
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.400]   don't mean any kind of moral judgment to it.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.560]   Like, should you want it or not?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   It's just, you want it.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400]   So we're just dealing with like a pure one and someone will say, I want this.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   And then the first thing they'll ask is, can I afford it?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.520]   You know, could I buy this if I want it?
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.320]   And can I afford this is one of the most stress inducing questions we ask
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.080]   ourselves, or we ask each other if we're sharing finances, sometimes we don't ask
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.360]   each other.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   And that also is a whole other separate thing.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   So you say, let's say that you ask yourself, can I afford this?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   And then you say, yes.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   Then you buy the thing.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.160]   You don't actually know if you can, you looked at your bank balance, you saw that
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   it was high or low, whatever that means to you.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   And you gave yourself permission to buy it.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.200]   But then after the fact, so many times people will be like, ah, should I have
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.360]   shared that they'll feel kind of this little pang of guilt.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480]   Like, I don't know worse.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.360]   They get a bill the next day that I hadn't thought about when they were doing the,
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   can I afford this dance?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.680]   And then they know they couldn't afford it.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.200]   Then they feel really bad.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.400]   Or the flip side is the person actually can afford it.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.640]   They do buy it, but they don't know that they could.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.720]   So whether or not they can't afford it or can't, they both don't know it.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.480]   And they both feel guilty or consternation or stress because of it.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.280]   So a budget solves that stress of, can I afford this by telling you?
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.440]   Yes, you can go buy it.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   Enjoy it.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.200]   Don't feel guilty about it.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.120]   Or no, you can't.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   And that still brings a lot of people peace and resolution to
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   what they're trying to figure out.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.920]   Now, does it mean you can't ever buy it?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.280]   No, no.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   It might just mean you need to wait a little bit.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.640]   You know, you might need to wait a paycheck or two, but it's freeing
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.600]   because it frees you from that question that you can't answer accurately.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.360]   And that's what we're trying to tackle for people.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.200]   And does it have to be hard?
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.280]   Is there a 80/20 to get started that doesn't involve looking at every
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.000]   expense you've had for the last year and categorizing everything?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   That often seems daunting.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.080]   When you said it's like a plan, it's like, oh man, I got to put
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   together a full financial plan.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   That sounds scary.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.040]   What's the way to get started thinking about it that maybe doesn't have
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.360]   to be so scary and you can do in, you know, minutes or maybe a couple hours?
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.160]   Let's do it.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   Well, first, first, do not look back.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   So with the first rule of budgeting, I mean, we have four rules.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.560]   Our first rule is not actually this, but really what we're talking
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.960]   about is do not look back.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160]   Do not look at your history.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's already done.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   It's finished.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.400]   So you can't, you can't change anything about it.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   We only are looking forward.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   That will save you countless hours.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.720]   If you just say, oh, I'll just deal with what's forward.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.840]   Then if you're talking about five minutes, pull out your phone, look at your bank
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   balance and ask yourself one question.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.680]   This is the question you ask.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.080]   What does this money in my bank account need to do before more money will come in?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.520]   Don't tell yourself, oh, more money will come in on Friday.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.680]   So what should that money do to it?
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.520]   Resist the urge.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.160]   When we coach people, sometimes one-on-one a little bit, they'll often say like, oh,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.560]   well, I'll get paid, Jesse, hold on.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   I'll get paid in five days.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.760]   And I'm like, no, no, no.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.320]   We only want to deal with money that is on hand.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.280]   So if you do those two things, you forget history and you only decide to budget the
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   money that you have on hand in the moment.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.680]   Suddenly that big financial plan that looked really scary.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.800]   It's nothing like that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's just, hey, I have $800 in my checking account.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.480]   200 needs to go to groceries.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.400]   150 needs to go to this bill.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   70 for my cell phone.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.160]   You know, it's very clear.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   It's amazing how many times we walk people through this hundreds of thousands of
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.200]   people, and at the end of that simple five minute exercise, they will often say, oh
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.000]   my gosh, I feel so much more in control already.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.720]   And we're like, that is a budget.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   A budget is control.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.520]   It's awareness.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.280]   It's intention.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.000]   And you only get intention by looking at money actually on hand.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.400]   And you only have that intention going, going forward.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.440]   Well, you would have saved me countless hours of arguments with my wife because my
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.160]   version of budgeting that, you know, like dieting just totally went by the wayside
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   and never to be repeated in our house was at the end of every year, we said, okay,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.600]   let's download our mint history of every transaction.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.720]   Let's categorize it all.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.160]   Let's see how much we're spending.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.120]   And the reason I did that, and I'm curious if you think it's not valuable, if there's
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.440]   an alternative was, you know, it helped me say, okay, I make X, I spend Y, I'm okay.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.480]   Like I'm what I'm doing today works.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.560]   And that actually freed me up to say, if I just keep doing what I'm doing, I'm
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.320]   probably okay, and I don't need to be thinking about it every day because last
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.680]   year I did.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.160]   Okay.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   But it was a lot of work.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.360]   It, you know, if you just look at the money you have today and what its purpose
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.000]   is, is there any easy way to get a sense of, I don't know how much I'm saving this
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.200]   year or, uh, kind of some of those more macro ideas.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.360]   The macro is interesting because it can give you an idea of, I don't know what
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.000]   happened, what may happen again.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.080]   The New York times ran an article years ago that still kind of makes me mad
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   because they were, they came off as, as, um, this light bulb moment where they
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.120]   were saying, Hey, on, you know, if on annual budgets, people tend to stay
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   within an annual budget, that was their point.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.720]   And, and I just was shaking my head.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.840]   Like an annual budget is not where mistakes are made.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.320]   Mistakes are made on the Saturday and Sunday between two paychecks.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.640]   That's when the mistakes were made.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.160]   So what we're talking about is like, when I look at your, the Hutchins
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.040]   household, like macro view, I'm like, yeah, on average, they're good.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   And most people, when they come to us, they're like, I don't get it.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.480]   I make good money.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.040]   Like, why aren't I getting ahead?
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.960]   What's the deal here?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.200]   And it's not because of the macro level, they aren't looking okay.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.600]   It's because on January 22nd, they had purchased some really nice boots that
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.880]   they definitely wanted, and they're totally okay to buy boots, but on the
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.000]   23rd, they also had a life insurance premium come due and they're like,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.720]   oh, it was just a timing issue, right?
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   And so, because there was a timing mismatch of money on hand and money
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.880]   required, they had to put a little bit on the card and most, you know, we know
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.480]   the average, you know, credit card balance for Americans.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.760]   It was honestly in 2020, it was just dropping like crazy much to the bank
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.280]   sphere, but we're heading right back where we were, you know, pre pandemic.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.480]   And so many of those swipes are just timing mismatches.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   It's like, I didn't have the resource, but I used to have the resource.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.880]   And what we want to have people do is just look ahead to those
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.680]   larger, less frequent expenses.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.840]   And then when you're debating whether or not you want to buy these boots, I
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   hate to use examples, Chris, because then people will be like, oh my gosh, Jesse
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.560]   doesn't think I should buy boots.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.920]   I really don't care.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.240]   You know, like what I do not care what you spend your money on.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.120]   I just want you to make sure that all your big expenses are taken care of as well.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   So let's say you've got this insurance premium that's due in eight months, you
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.920]   divide it by eight and you have a monthly insurance bill now that you're setting
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.480]   aside for, and the software does this, you know, that's, that's the software part.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.240]   But then you're also debating, like, should I buy these boots or not now?
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's like, you have future Chris and current Chris that are at
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.480]   the negotiating table together.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.280]   And, and current Chris is like, I want the boots and future.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.240]   Chris is like, yeah, it's fine.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.600]   Cause you've been, you've set me up.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.960]   I'll be good with the insurance payment or future.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.720]   Chris is like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.920]   Don't take, no, not yet.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.840]   Wait a little bit.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.320]   We have this due or future.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.400]   Chris is on the side of a road and he's a tow truck.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.040]   And it's like, come on, man, throw me a bone.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.360]   Like car repairs really happened.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.080]   They're really a thing.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.760]   It's the mismatch of when we have the money available so much of the
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.360]   time that gets us into trouble.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.040]   So I want people to pretend that they have like a future version of
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.760]   themselves that also has a say in what current money should be doing.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.840]   I like that.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.240]   I actually think sometimes budgeting is create a bunch of buckets and
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.760]   then see what happens with the money.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   And this is flipping it and it's see where the money is and then decide
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.120]   what needs to happen with it.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.920]   Yes.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.120]   In many ways, it's totally different from what anyone ever thinks of as budgeting.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.240]   So I'm curious, did you ever consider calling it something different?
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.520]   Oh yes.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.440]   And still like literally to this day, I'm like, should we rename, you know,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.960]   like we're this company called you need a budget and half of the country is just,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.280]   or world is like, oh my gosh, I will not give that guy the time of day.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.960]   And that kind of worries me, you know, cause I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.680]   That's not what I meant.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.560]   It's not what I meant to say.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.840]   You know, I feel like I'm chasing after him trying to explain what I really mean
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.600]   when I say budget.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.080]   So yeah, I've totally like from a purely like product guide or product guy, I'm
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.640]   like, Hmm, is our name right?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.880]   You know, like there's, there's something there to that.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.640]   I don't know what I would name it, but, uh, every domain is taken now.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.120]   So if you have any ideas, let me know.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.440]   I mean, I at least liked it.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.360]   YNAB doesn't, you know, it could just be a name, right?
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.280]   If you need a budget in its long form, obviously bring some kind of emotions
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.160]   out, but if you just call it just YNAB, it's, it's you, maybe you don't think
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.720]   about the word budget out the gate.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.840]   I've also thought like, maybe, maybe we're trying to purposely exclude people
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.480]   that aren't ready to hear the news, you know?
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.920]   So I don't know, but that's the marketer.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.440]   That's like always, always debating like, is this, is this working or not?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.640]   It's a pretty good filter.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   It gets a laugh when I tell people, yeah, I, you know, my company's name is you
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.280]   need a budget.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.480]   And they're like, ah, like nervous, you know, but, uh, everybody does, regardless
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.960]   of income level, I've tested it.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.320]   I've tested not having one and I make pretty good income and it wasn't, it
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.800]   wasn't good.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.120]   So everyone needs one.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.640]   So everyone, what would you say to the person that's saving on track for
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.120]   retirement, not using a budget and spending money and enjoying life and
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.760]   feeling like everything's working?
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.880]   What could a budget do for that person?
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   I would argue this might be semantics.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.440]   I would argue that they already are budgeting.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.360]   It's just very high level.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.880]   So they've budgeted for savings.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   They probably have an idea of what they want to spend on like large purchases,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.520]   vacation, holiday spending, things like that.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   And also they would naturally in this circumstance have to have lots of
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.120]   wiggle room because they need to have enough money where those timing issues
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   don't pop up.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.520]   And that does take, that takes a good bit of income above your expenses.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.680]   I mean, there's a good gap of living within your means for people that don't
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.720]   deal with timing issues.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.800]   I'm one of those people.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.960]   I don't deal with, with timing issues now.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.920]   You know, if you were to be like, Hey, eight of your big bills came at once.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.080]   I'd be like, oh, that was uncomfortable, but we, it would be fine.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   But most people, especially for the first while, as they're working the budget,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.080]   they, they are definitely dealing with a timing problem.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   So I'm someone that's lucky enough to not have to budget so specifically that
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.320]   that's fine.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.280]   Their budget is optimized for their circumstance, but most people do not
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.880]   have that circumstance.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.800]   So I tested it in 20, was it 2020?
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.960]   Yeah, it was, it was just last year.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.800]   Cause I just ended it.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   I tested doing a very high level budget for me and Julie.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.360]   And like we had an other category that was just massive and I would just update
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   once a month and be like, did checking account go up or down?
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.480]   And I would make an adjustment and then budget money.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.840]   And I lost thousands and thousands of dollars somehow.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.760]   I don't know what we spent, but like for the first time in seven years, our
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.480]   checking account didn't stay at this level that it's like boring, how it just
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.720]   stays there for the first time in like years after 2020, and it wasn't because
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.000]   of the pandemic, cause we didn't eat out.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.600]   We didn't travel.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.960]   Like there was some things going for us to make that number go up.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.240]   It was interesting.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   Cause yeah, money was gone.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.640]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, first time in so many years that our checking
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.160]   account is down probably 18, 25%.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.920]   And I couldn't say why, and it might be the recovering accountant in me that
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.080]   just is really bothered by not having the accountability for it, but I did find it
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.400]   interesting without that awareness, without that intention, like the
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.640]   money just kind of did what it did.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.600]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.720]   If you ever find out what happened to it, let us know.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.840]   Maybe it's in that unclaimed money stuff.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.800]   Like maybe that in that hack that you, you know, you talk about with unclaimed
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.280]   money that they're like, oh my gosh, Jesse's unclaimed money is with the state
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   of Utah, he just doesn't know it.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.440]   So I don't know what happened to it.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.400]   I get it.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.680]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.000]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.040]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.400]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.480]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.520]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.360]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.760]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.280]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.560]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.640]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.840]   ever leaving yours.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.760]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.000]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.360]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.200]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.000]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.000]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.920]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.280]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.920]   Now, I noticed one interesting thing.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.000]   When you say, you know, the company, it's, it's YNAB, you need a budget.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.720]   You're not saying you need YNAB as a customer and software, you don't think
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.000]   it's for everyone, but you think the process of budgeting is, and you're
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.880]   willing to share how you guys do it.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   Could you talk a little bit about the difference between this kind of style of
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.240]   budgeting you've created and the company and the software?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.160]   Yeah, we teach four rules.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.880]   We teach to give every dollar a job.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.560]   And we mentioned that already, like only money you have on hand, not money
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.760]   you're going to get, and you're facing forward.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.240]   What jobs will this money do?
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   The second rule we call it embracing your true expenses, which means
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.760]   Christmas is a true expense.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.200]   Like Christmas is a monthly bill.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.080]   Uh, car repairs are monthly bills.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.240]   They just don't come that way.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.240]   But as you start to take large, less frequent expenses, break
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.600]   them up into monthly amounts.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.320]   You can see that your real expenses aren't just cable groceries and all
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.520]   those like monthly standard stuff.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.560]   That's rule two.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.000]   So you have rule one and rule two, where you're giving every dollar job,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.640]   including future you in this equation.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.720]   Rule three is to change your mind.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.160]   We call it rolling with the punches, but it's just like when life happens, you
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.720]   end up having visitors come to the house.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.080]   You have to catch a flight somewhere for an emergency life happens.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.920]   And, and so you need to be able to adjust the budget as needed.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.600]   A lot of people think budgeting is like, I don't know, like it's just set in stone
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.760]   and rigid budgets, they, they break.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.960]   And so we, one of our rules is to be flexible.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.560]   You're, you're more like a, a coach making adjustments to how the opponents
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:34.720]   are playing all the time versus just being some clairvoyant person that can guess and
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.280]   predict every single spending move you'll make our fourth rule is called age your
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.760]   money, and it's essentially the idea that when you follow the first three rules,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.760]   you will get to a point where the money you're spending today, you earned
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.480]   30, 40, 50, a hundred days ago.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.600]   It's a people that you mentioned Chris earlier on that have that pretty
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.920]   good slush in their budget.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.240]   They'll have an age of money that is far higher because they aren't
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.360]   living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.800]   And so our fourth rule is basically a metric that the software tracks that
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.640]   tells you like how close to that paycheck to paycheck edge are you?
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.720]   So I mentioned those four rules in brief.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.920]   We dive into them with classes and podcasts, everything under the sun to
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.680]   teach people those four rules, because it's, it's about how you're thinking
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.200]   about the money, and then you can run off to mint or what, um, yeah, you could
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.920]   probably do it with mint or your own spreadsheet.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.120]   Like this whole company came about because I started it with a spreadsheet.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.680]   So I would never fault someone for building their own.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.160]   You can run it with ledger paper that your grandma might have in
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.920]   like an old drawer or something.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.640]   Like there are places where you could run the method and you don't need to worry
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.360]   about the software.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.440]   Our software is killer best in the business, but for some reason, if
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.480]   someone's like, I I'd like to roll my own, I mean, my word, go for it.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.400]   You know, there are enough people that will buy our software.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.440]   I'm not too worried about it.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.120]   Are there specific things that software does that you think, uh, are worth
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.920]   calling out that makes it hard to do on your own or things like that tracking
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.120]   that age of money number, which now I'm sitting here like, I want to track that.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.240]   That seems like a good metric.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yeah, it's, uh, well, one thing on your phone, I mean, the apps on your phone,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.400]   obviously, and on the web and all of that it's with Alexa, you could ask Alexa,
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.120]   how much is in your grocery category, but she'll tell your friends and neighbors
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.280]   too.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.120]   Like, you have to be careful.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.600]   She's not like super discreet.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.400]   So you, you know, on your phone, like I can be in home Depot and go to add a
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.920]   transaction and the phone recognizes like, Oh, Jesse's in home Depot.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.400]   Last time you were, you know, he put this as home maintenance cause I'm buying air
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.360]   filters or something.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.920]   And so it like pre-populates all of that.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.840]   It's, it's like a two second thing.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.680]   Um, you could probably build some kind of a Google format route to like a
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.880]   spreadsheet of your own and maybe get smart and do something like that as well.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   But the phone itself just on the go is dynamite.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.400]   You can share it with your spouse or partner, and then you are both on the same
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.840]   page.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.880]   And so, you know, you and your wife are like, Hey, how much do we have to work
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   within two different categories?
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   And you can both make decisions independent of each other that will be totally
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.120]   appropriate and fine.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.480]   And then, you know, monthly you can get together and kind of make your plan.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.600]   So the sharing of information we've nailed, and then the obviously grabbing bank
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:10.200]   transactions, that is a quagmire of politics and tech and like old tubes of old
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.520]   banks.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.680]   Like it's a mess of a place, but we do our absolute best.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   And I don't want to give away the farm, but we use multiple providers.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.160]   We do very smart things behind the scenes to make sure that we're really trying to
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.480]   give the best experience we can.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.120]   And so for users just to be able to pull in their bank transactions and catch those
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.080]   that they didn't do on their phone, that's something that would be real tough, real
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   tough to build on your own.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.120]   So much so that I think paying the annual fee for us might, as far as hacks go,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.800]   might be a pretty good hack at that point, you know, so I don't know.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.320]   And how much time do you think a YNAB user can get to needing to spend on
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.160]   budgeting each week or month or day?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.680]   Yeah, I, this year I do experiments every year.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.160]   2020 was my experiment of basically no budgeting.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.960]   The year before I did an experiment where I was all manual.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.320]   I didn't connect to any bank accounts.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.040]   Every morning I would sit down and literally type in each
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.880]   transaction from the prior day.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.760]   You know, we've got a big family, seven kids, and we got some churn in the
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.080]   house as far as transactions go, but it took me, it was a little ritual.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.040]   It was like a five minute thing each morning and you know, staying on top of
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.000]   it daily was, was dynamite for as far as like behavior change goes for anyone
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.360]   that's saying I'm kind of a little bit of a train wreck, I would like to do this
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.320]   better, the more frequent visiting of your budget is key because we're
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.720]   trying to get behavior change.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   But if things are on autopilot, I do it like weekly on my phone,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.800]   sitting somewhere, you know, lazily.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   And I'm just going through and categorizing and I think probably an
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.760]   hour a month on kind of maintenance.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.400]   I'm, I'm pretty good at it, but I mean, I'd like to think so.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   I'm not like trying to go fast or anything.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.640]   It's just, it's pretty, pretty straightforward.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.880]   So now I will say my, my finances are very, very simple.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.600]   I have one credit card, one checking account.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.720]   I'm not trying to manage my entire financial life.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.480]   We're just trying to manage our inflows and outflows.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.200]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.280]   I mean, sitting in the line at a grocery store, scrolling through Instagram, you
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.080]   know, those small bits of time is probably, you could use it like this.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.520]   You don't need one hour sitting straight at a computer.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.320]   You can kind of do it in pieces throughout the month.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.720]   Is that.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.640]   Give us a little bit of your Instagram time.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   That's what I'll, that's, that's going to be a hook now.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   Just like, can we have 10 minutes of your Instagram time each week?
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   I think we can do this.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.640]   And I love that you are, are building a company around convenience.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.520]   I know something we've done at Wealthfront is like, look, if you want
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.600]   a portfolio, we'll give it to you.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.200]   Uh, we're not trying to make a secret out of how we invest your money.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.680]   The value we offer is that we make it easier, faster, and more
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.720]   convenient to do what you want to do.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.480]   And if you don't want that, you know, come here, read our blog, look at our articles.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.080]   So I love that you guys have a similar approach to focusing the value on making
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.680]   life convenient and doing it at what I think is a very reasonable price to pay,
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.440]   to get back the time it would take to use a grandma's ledger paper.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.400]   You said you have seven children.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   I've one child and there's a lot of costs, seven, obviously, hopefully
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.560]   you get some economies of scale, but running a family that big, are there
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.000]   things you've, you know, had to do or, or hacks you've had to introduce to
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.040]   your life, your spending, et cetera, to make everything run more smoothly?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.960]   So obviously hand-me-downs become much more valuable when there's
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   like a downline for kids.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.880]   So you got to do the hand-me-down thing that goes without
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.360]   saying you store those clothes.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.480]   I mean, there are tiny things like we don't fold laundry at all ever.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.760]   Because more, I feel like that, that might sound like a crazy thing to people.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.560]   We have photos of the kids folding their laundry and it would all be in a big
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.000]   basket and we'd be in the living room.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.640]   And I snapped a photo from years ago when they were probably like six, four, two
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.080]   and zero or something like that.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   It was a big chore every week, like a huge chore and the kids hated it.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   And so now we teach them to use the washer really, really early.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.640]   And it's super easy.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.720]   And the dryer's just as easy.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.440]   And then as soon as they can reach the soap, it's like, okay,
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.520]   you're old enough to do this.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.880]   They put in their own load.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.000]   They change it over.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.120]   Julie will harp on them like, Hey, change it over.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.320]   Hey, go change over the laundry.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.760]   Hey, go, you know, she does that.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.600]   But then they just drag it back down to their rooms.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.720]   And that's the end of us caring about laundry.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.600]   And I know they don't fold it independently.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   Like, I know I'm not lying right now.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.560]   You know, like we just, we don't fold.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.120]   Even you, your shirt's just thrown in the drawer unfolded or?
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.520]   I mean, I fold, but I, it's like, for me, it's like, it takes me five minutes.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.120]   You know, I'm like, this is nothing, but to manage it for seven people, I'm
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.160]   like, you know what, you know what, well, you have a one-year-old, what it's
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.360]   like to fold like a one-year-old onesie.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.920]   You're like, this thing is so small.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.480]   Like, what are we doing here?
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.080]   So yeah, that's that story ended a long time ago.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.880]   He just, it saves so much time, not folding laundry.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.840]   It's unbelievable.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.120]   And the kids don't care.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.880]   They don't care.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.960]   The onesie is a little wrinkled.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.920]   It's like not a big deal.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.280]   Come on.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.280]   They're not going to important business meetings.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.960]   What about food?
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.240]   How do you manage meals for a household of nine?
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.320]   So we don't do leftovers cause there is nothing left over.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.480]   You know, people will say like, Oh, you know, cook on Saturday and
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.520]   make like all of your lunches or do like make all of it.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.760]   I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.880]   We'd need like a commercial kitchen to knock that out.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.240]   Like it.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.840]   So we, we, the leftover thing isn't a hack for us.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.000]   I have noticed some, a few small things.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.520]   Um, well, one is we, we'd never put the food on the table because to have seven
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.480]   tiny voices and some that sound like man, children now, but like to have those
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.360]   people be like, Hey, it's past this.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.760]   And like, they won't use the person's name.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.280]   It'll just be like, pass this past the salt pass.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.920]   And like, it's just this cacophony of past this.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.880]   And then it's been like, Hey, I asked three times or like someone grabs it
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.760]   before they pass it and they take some, and then someone else gets upset.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.320]   Cause they, it's called a shortstop.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   Chris, I don't know if you've dealt with that, but if someone, you
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.480]   know, intercepts it, it's a shortstop.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.720]   And you're like, Oh my gosh, we cannot do this.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.800]   This like, we can't converse and we're big on dinner.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.240]   Like we're big on eating together.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.520]   Like that talk about life hacks.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.560]   I feel like that's like top three.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.760]   It's like eat dinner together as a family.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.320]   Like, it's just so it's like this great touchstone for you.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.160]   So I don't want to throw dinner out.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.000]   So we bring all the food over to the Island, leave it off the
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.120]   table and it's all buffet style.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.680]   And that, that helps tremendously.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.720]   The other thing that like, even gosh, tinier hacks, like Julie and I, when
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   we're plating the kid's food, because that's faster than having tiny
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.840]   hands using large spoons, we years ago decided we would lay all the plates
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.760]   out, like top to bottom, left to right age order.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.160]   So I would always be bottom right.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.840]   And Julie's just next to me, you know?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.920]   And when we would have guests, this is what's funny.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.400]   I like, if you were over at our house, Chris, I'd be like, Chris, how old are
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.560]   you?
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.280]   And maybe you say like, I don't know, you're 39 or something.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.760]   I'm, I'm guessing I'd be like, oh, well, you're younger than me,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   but you're older than Julie.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.320]   So I would stick you between me and Julie.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.520]   Like we're very, like we, we stick with the age thing, even when we have guests
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.880]   over, but that helped me and Julie not have to be like, who's plate is this?
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.640]   Who's plate is that?
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.000]   You know?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.680]   And because you're, you're portioning.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.120]   Proportionate to the mass of the individual.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.480]   And it's, you know, there's, there's big variation until dessert comes.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   And then for some reason, the proportions don't matter anymore to those little
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:07.880]   kids.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.960]   They're like, why isn't my piece as big as that kid?
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.160]   That's four times my size.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.800]   You know, you have to explain it.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.680]   We've discussed growth rates and things, but it's still a fight.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.520]   So yeah, can't figure it out, but yeah, those are a few it's a, it's a fun, I
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.200]   mean, there's, it's always lively, you know, can I give you another one on the
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.920]   family stuff?
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.640]   Absolutely.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.040]   I, uh, you know, dinner was one that's like family together time.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.200]   I know you're big on like intentionally making sure relationships are solid.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.480]   Another one that I love, I call it parlor time with the kids and the parlor is an
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.400]   old room, you know, that people don't know about anymore, but like the parlor
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.720]   was where the family would go when like the day's work was done and maybe there
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.240]   wasn't even electricity or something.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.160]   And it's this very romanticized idea.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.960]   And I probably have cattle at that point.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.160]   And you know, like there's a lot going on in my head with parlor time, but at the
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.240]   end of the day, it's where we all sit and I tell the kids, you can read, you can
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.760]   play a game with someone, but we're all in this room.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.320]   Like you can do whatever you want, but we're all in this room.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.480]   Obviously no screens like that would kind of suck someone away.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.120]   And I love parlor time.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.840]   So you'll have kids that are, uh, you know, sitting there playing a game.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.200]   A lot.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.120]   My kids are readers.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.160]   A lot of them will read.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.520]   I, at that point, I love the reading and you just have all your kids kind of in
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.280]   that little spot for a little bit of time, 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.240]   That feels good.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.600]   That's one of my favorite acts.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.560]   No, no, it just, I mean, honestly, it's just like, I call for it.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.200]   Sometimes like guys were doing parlor time and you know, like sometimes there's a
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   little bit of groaning, but everyone comes up and they'll have something they can do.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.120]   It's mostly for like Sundays where things are a little more chill already.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.880]   And, uh, I love it.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.600]   Love that.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.160]   So the kids like it too.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.560]   Once they settle in, you know, if we go back in time a little bit, how did you end
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.360]   up, uh, becoming the, the YNAB guy?
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.480]   Like the, the guy who's like, I love budgeting.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.640]   I start a company telling people they need a budget.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.040]   What's the origin of that story?
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.400]   I wish I have some grand vision of entrepreneurial, you know, I don't
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.320]   know, swagger or something, but it was nothing of the sort.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.520]   I, Julie and I were married pretty young and then scraping, you
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.320]   know, making 10 bucks an hour in school.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.800]   I had three years of school to get my master's in accountancy.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.440]   She wrapped up her schooling, but it was in social work.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.720]   So her full-time job, she was making $11 an hour.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   And we were actually pretty thrilled with that.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.920]   You know, we're like, oh my gosh, 11 bucks.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.760]   This isn't too bad.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.520]   Rent was 350 bucks a month, including some of our utilities.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.840]   Like, you know, we lived on the cheap, which I know you can appreciate,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.120]   but we wanted to have a baby.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.760]   And so when the baby was coming, Julie also wanted to be able
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.520]   to step out of the workforce.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.280]   She's just like, I just want to focus on this baby, new mom,
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.000]   you know, obviously new baby.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.520]   And so that was a big deal for us.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.520]   The other big deal for us was we didn't want to borrow money for school.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.480]   I had a little scholarship that helped with tuition some, and I kept
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.040]   crunching numbers, like, how can I, can I work more hours?
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.800]   But my accounting program already really frowned on lots of work.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.360]   So I was working more than what they allowed even, and I just
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.520]   couldn't squeeze out any more.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.760]   And at least not structured in that way.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.840]   And so we had been using a spreadsheet that I had built for just the two of us
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.200]   and it had worked well, like we had gotten some savings together and we just
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.960]   weren't going to be able to get those last two years without borrowing.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.000]   And I was kind of mad because I'm like, man, we've been budgeting.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.160]   We can't live any more cheaply than we are.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.440]   And it wasn't going to be enough.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.160]   And so I had this just kind of crazy, a little bit egotistical idea.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.600]   I was like, Oh, maybe, maybe people would just buy this spreadsheet from me.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:39.240]   And so I launched with a spreadsheet, like, you know, September of '04 launched
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:45.000]   and sold little bits at a time, enough to keep the interest of me.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.440]   And then in February of '05, I discovered that the spreadsheet had
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.120]   enforced rules that I hadn't known were there.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.440]   And so I turned it around and started talking about the rules and a lot less
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.200]   about the spreadsheet and our sales doubled and then doubled again.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.760]   And I mean, doubled like, you know, 500 to a thousand, a thousand to 2000.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.240]   It wasn't a crazy number, but that was enough for me to think, Oh, the
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.040]   rules are kind of the key here.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.320]   The spreadsheets kind of second fiddle.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.000]   And then I met a guy named Taylor, who's now my business partner.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.480]   And he said, Hey, I can improve the spreadsheet.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   I'm a developer.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.160]   And I said, no, uh, how about just real software?
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.920]   You know, and he said, I can do that too.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.000]   So we launched the first like windows only, like paste in your license
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.160]   key type software back in the day.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.080]   Uh, we launched that had never met each other in person and
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.760]   launched that at the end of '06.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.040]   By that time I was a CPA and, uh, doing my CPA thing for about 10
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   months before I realized I do not like doing this and I really liked this
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.080]   little side gig, the side hustle, you know, and, um, I was making more from
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.560]   my side hustle than I was from my CPA job.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.400]   So it still took me a little bit of time to get up the guts and realize that I
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.640]   could support a family on my own business.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.120]   Only years later, do you realize that.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.240]   There's no super secure way to make money.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.160]   Like there's always risk of things, but yeah, that was kind of the Genesis.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.280]   And we've just iterated on that little old spreadsheet since then.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:12.120]   So now that, you know, the spreadsheet died, gosh, 15 years ago, but, uh, the
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.680]   software just keeps getting better and better.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.680]   And I think we keep getting better and better at teaching people how to think
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   differently about their money.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.960]   So it's, yeah, it's been a fun business to run.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.760]   It's been fun to see people make changes, you know, that like they'll, they'll
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.440]   write and be like, Oh, our marriage is better.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.880]   Or I took this, I took a job that had a pay cut, but the job is way better.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   And it's like stuff like that where you're like, man.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.440]   And then they're like, my family life is better.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.000]   You're like, how do you put a price tag on that type of win for somebody?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.360]   You know?
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   So it's, it's a fun business to, to be involved in.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.160]   Do any of those stories include cool ways people have managed to up-level their
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.040]   finances outside of just, you know, budgeting hacks they've learned or
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.400]   shared or things they've done?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.760]   I'll give one, I mean, this might be obvious and this is maybe too close to
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.040]   budgeting to be appreciated by your audience perhaps, but the biggest hack of
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.600]   all is when you realize that some of your money has been doing things you don't
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.560]   actually value like that, that it's like the, it's like a, it's a high level
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.800]   optimization you're doing there.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.720]   And so the budget at the end of the day is a tool to let you know that your
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.000]   money is, is going toward the things you value.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.120]   We spend all this time like hacking our careers, you know, like making sure that
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.880]   we're making the most, that we love our job.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.560]   We've gone to school and then we're like day to day, we're getting up early.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.880]   We're like grinding, we're adding value.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.560]   We, we put all of this energy into the time to money creation, right?
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.000]   Where we're converting our time into money.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:42.160]   As soon as the money is in our hands, for some reason, so many people don't just
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.120]   extend that effort a little bit further and say, okay, now that it's money, how
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.800]   do I optimize it to be in line with what I truly care about?
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   They stop.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.400]   They've optimized their career like crazy.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.080]   They're killing it.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.320]   They're high performing, but then it's become money.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.880]   And they're like, oh, I'm not a money person or whatever that, I hate that.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   You know, we, I want people to just extend a little bit of effort a little
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.200]   further along, like take a surgeon, for example, someone's just like high
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.680]   performer, you know, saving people's lives every day.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.600]   And then there's like, oh, I'm not good with money.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.960]   I'm like, come on, man, you replace someone's heart.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.160]   Like you're good.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.240]   You're good at anything you decide to attack with that brain of yours.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.800]   So like, you're good with money.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.720]   You're good with whatever.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.560]   Just, you just got to learn how to make sure that it's doing
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   what you really care about.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.800]   That's the biggest hack of all.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.440]   Of course, in our forums, in our Reddit, like we have an awesome subreddit.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.880]   Our Facebook fans group is, they're the ones where you can go and then be like,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.080]   Hey, everyone, you know, I got this health insurance bill totally caught me off guard.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.160]   And people will be like, oh, I can tell you a story.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.040]   Here's what you can do.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.240]   So our community is full of them.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.800]   But for me, I, I just focus on that big one money priorities,
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.560]   perfectly in alignment, magic.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.720]   That's great.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.200]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.520]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.720]   deals, and discounts from our partners.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.000]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.840]   So please consider supporting those who support us and outside of budgeting in
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.480]   your own life, are there things you're doing with savings investing that, you
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.080]   know, what, what does that world look like for you?
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:24.000]   So one that I found that's kind of like a nerdy, I like just heard about recently.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.680]   I mean, you're, you're familiar with like the Roth, like the mega backdoor Roth
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.480]   type stuff that people will be able to get tax-free growth.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.720]   I'm in a tax bracket where the Roth isn't available to me anymore.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.320]   And we did this deal with our 401k when we switched providers and they have a,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.880]   they have a setup where you can contribute after-tax money to your 401k and
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.440]   immediately convert it to a Roth.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.200]   And so there's no gain on that after-tax money.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.080]   There's no growth gain that you would then have to actually pay taxes on
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.800]   because they've converted immediately.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.600]   So we went from being able to save, what is it?
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.760]   19, five or something, I can put away like pre-tax.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:07.400]   I can go all the way up to, I think, 50 grand, that difference for after-tax
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.000]   and then convert it to a Roth.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   So I can get in to a Roth, even though I am technically allowed, but
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.240]   I'm, but I'm not easily allowed.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.280]   And so that was one that like just this year, I discovered a lot of, a lot of
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.560]   our employees at YNAB jumped on that, trying to, you know, maximize that
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.600]   savings that they can get.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.880]   So you get this tax-free growth.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.200]   Then later on down the road, we're talking years later, I now have this
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.600]   tax-free money that I can use and strategically time with deductions and
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.120]   other things, it gives you room to maneuver and make your income go up or
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.520]   down as needed, you know, to optimize your tax bill.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.720]   So that was one.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.680]   Yeah, there's two, two, two things I'll tack on that.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.000]   So yeah, look, if your employer offers it, there's something
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.320]   called the mega backdoor Roth.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.200]   If your employer doesn't, and you're not eligible for Roth, you
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.680]   could still do a backdoor Roth.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.200]   And, you know, I would say Google around, there's a lot of things to be careful of.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.880]   If you already have a lot of traditional IRA assets, it can be a real tax problem.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.120]   But if you don't have an IRA at all, and you're not eligible to contribute to your
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.880]   Roth, you can contribute after-tax money to just a traditional Roth and roll it
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.280]   over, or if your employer allows, and the question to ask is, do you allow me to
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.600]   make after-tax contributions to my IRA and do, I think it's called an in-plan
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.120]   rollover, but if you just Google mega backdoor Roth, there's so much stuff out
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.000]   there, it's really cool and lets you really boost your retirement savings.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.800]   The other thing, if, if you build up a really big Roth IRA balance, if you're
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.960]   already set for retirement or, or you're already saving enough to be on track and,
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.240]   and you have enough and you want to take a little bit of risk, something that people
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.560]   don't often realize is, you know, we say, look, if you want to take risk in your
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.760]   investment portfolio, let's, let's keep that to like 10% or less, and you could
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.480]   go pick stocks or you could invest in crypto and that kind of stuff.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.760]   Well, it turns out that a lot of those risky things, you know, are high risk,
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.920]   high return, and most people do them in their taxable account, but if you search
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.240]   around online, there's a handful of companies that let you do self-directed
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.320]   IRA investing, which means you can start to do some of those risky things in your
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.280]   IRA, which I will give this huge caveat that like, this is only if you're on
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.320]   track for retirement, otherwise, like you should not be risking your retirement
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:22.280]   money. But if you're on track for retirement, you can actually self-direct
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   your IRA and use that to invest in stocks or invest in cryptocurrency or invest in
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.160]   things that are higher risk, higher return.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.880]   And if you Google around, there's a handful of people that have been doing
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.840]   this who have tens of millions of dollars in their IRA, which based on
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.080]   contribution limits seems impossible, but because they were using their IRA to
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.880]   make the more risky bets. So I'd say if you've already decided, I can take some
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.800]   risky bets with this amount of money, and you're diligent about saving for your
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   future, you could use your IRA to lower your tax bill if those risky bets pay
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.080]   off.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.480]   There's another one kind of speaking to the people that maybe haven't maxed out
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.240]   their kind of plain vanilla retirement. Like I should tell everyone just out of
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.680]   the gate, I'm allocated like a 90 year old grandma, like I am in bonds up to my
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.840]   ears, because my business is such a risky venture, right? Like all of my, my
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.640]   work and net worth is tied up in this business, essentially. So everything else
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.000]   is very, very safe. And that's appropriate. But for those people that
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.920]   are maybe not caught up on retirement, or they're feeling like they can't find
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.080]   the money, I introduced years ago on my podcast, the idea of what I call the 1%
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.200]   rule. And then something about the 1% in politics started coming out like that
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.920]   with that started become a phrase. And so I was like, Oh, man, I got to name it
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.600]   something else. But regardless of that, the idea is that every quarter, you
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.520]   increase your retirement contribution by 1%. And the next quarter, you do it
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.120]   again. And the next quarter, you do it again. And we're exercising the pay
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.280]   yourself first muscle. Just no matter where you're at, whether you're saving
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.320]   10% now or zero, just do 1%. I've had several people run that for now four
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.680]   years. And they've just kept doing it. And after a while, if you do that math
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.920]   really quickly, you know, five years in, you're saving 20% of your income. And I
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.960]   would encourage people just bump it a percent and see if you don't make do,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.840]   you know, see if it doesn't just work itself out, it will. So that that's one
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.120]   little hack that's like out of sight out of mind. Every quarter, you could even
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.960]   tell your employer if you have a cool, like a cool payroll office, they could
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.000]   potentially do this for you where you just say, Hey, I would like it to be
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.240]   raised 1%. And then next quarter, 1%, I will not come back and ask you, I just
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.600]   want you to do this for me. Here's my signed piece of paper or whatever that
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   says you can, and then set it on pure autopilot. Because it's interesting when
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.080]   we don't know what has happened. And when we aren't in our way, we can make
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.040]   really good decisions. And so it's a step beyond just being automatically
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.480]   defaulted into a 401k. And we're automatically increasing that rate. And
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.720]   just see if you don't die. You know, I think it'll work out.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.280]   I love that. Yeah, I mean, automation is so easy when it comes to saving
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.520]   nowadays, like I think about what parents and grandparents had to do to
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.600]   automate their savings and write checks and move money. And now, it's never been
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   easier to say sweep this money before I get to think about it before I get to
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.680]   spend it and put that away. So yeah, and I love that your kind of investment
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.800]   portfolio is so boring. I feel very similarly. And I keep talking to people
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.600]   who have been very successful. And most people's investment portfolios are kind
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.840]   of boring because they're doing taking a lot of risk with their work or their
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.080]   business, or maybe their jobs really boring, and they take a little bit more
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.880]   risk with investing. But I think too often, there's the hype of, you know,
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.600]   getting in on the next meme stock and all of that. And everyone assumes that
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.360]   that's how everyone's making money. And I'm like, No, I just have some diverse
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.680]   passive index funds. And I'm just, you know, spending my free time thinking
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.480]   about things that could level myself up like you did starting this business.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.880]   Yeah, I mean, I do a little bit of risky for fun entertainment type. I won't
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.440]   even call it investing. It's like, I'm not gonna call it gambling. But it's
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.080]   somewhere in the between those two. Yeah. And that's purely for fun and to chat
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.160]   about with my buddies, you know, but yeah, everything else. It's the 90 year
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.800]   old grandmother that goes to a bridge game. That's my asset allocation.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.480]   That's awesome. Any other hacks, tips, things you've learned in the space
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.280]   worth sharing? Man, I live a pretty regimented life in the sense that I wake
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.840]   up to an alarm clock and I get going first thing and I exercise first. I feel
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.280]   like that's a hack for me that helps tons. I eat the same thing for breakfast
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.920]   six out of seven days because you know, you just start to kind of find that you
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.080]   don't want to keep recreating the will I wear the same hat all the time. You
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.200]   know, the it's interesting because if you were to probably if I were to like
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.960]   follow myself around for a day, I'd be like, Oh, wait, that is interesting. I've
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.360]   given up a few, you know, over the years I used to have everyone turn off lights
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.800]   and be like the lights are, you know, like kids turn off your lights. Cause I
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:04.640]   grew up dealing with 60 watt bulbs. Like it did make a difference, but now, you
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.360]   know, you've got two watt bulbs and I'm like, I don't know if I should keep
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.240]   harping on the lights thing. You know, I think, and now you start installing
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.920]   switches to turn off lights when you leave rooms anyway. So there are things
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   that I've ended up just not caring about as I've gotten a little older, things
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   have changed. But, um, I like my family hacks. I, if I were to end on one, it'd
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.480]   be the dinner one. Try and make dinner happen with the kids. You know, if you
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.640]   don't have kids, just have dinner with your significant other. Like it's, it's
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   just a quieter time. You know, don't watch TV during dinner. Obviously don't
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.600]   pull your phones out during dinner. Obviously just eat slowly and chew your
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.000]   food 35 times or whatever that number is that people say is good. Yeah. And yeah,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.480]   converse a little bit slow down. I think that's done wonders for our family over
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.160]   the last 18 years. That's awesome. Yeah. We try to do that, uh, with the kid
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   every day and then without the kid once a week. Yes. The weekly date. That's a
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.560]   killer relationship hack. We do that as well. Yeah. Like religious about that
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.840]   thing. Weekly date. Yeah. Cool. Well, where do you want people to find you
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.800]   online and everything you're working on? Yeah. So if you liked my voice, the
