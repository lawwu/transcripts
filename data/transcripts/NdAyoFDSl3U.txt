[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   We are still considering, as most of you will recall, the words which are to be found in
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.920]   Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and verse 16.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.800]   The 16th verse in the 8th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, "The Spirit itself
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.880]   beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God."
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.080]   So we've arrived at a point at which we have been considering the nature or the character
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.920]   of this witness which the Holy Spirit bears with alongside of our spirits.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.520]   That is the fundamental statement of the verse and it is important that we should understand
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.760]   clearly that that is what it does teach and that furthermore we should have some idea
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:06.200]   as to the character of the witness which the Spirit does give alongside of and to and with
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.820]   our spirits.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:18.240]   We have also considered at the end, last Friday, to whom this witness is given.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.560]   And again we reminded ourselves that it's a witness that is given very often in very
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.800]   special circumstances.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.320]   If there has been some unusual trial or if God's people are to undergo some unusual
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.440]   trial, it's very often given just at such a time.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.840]   Then it's very often given, as we saw at the very end, just before the point of death.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.880]   And I read an illustration of that to you.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.920]   I could have multiplied that very easily indeed.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.840]   So now there we've been describing in general the nature and the character of this witness.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:10.400]   Now before we go on to consider other aspects of this teaching, such as how do we differentiate
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   between this and certain false experiences against which we are warned in the Scriptures,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.480]   we shall have to come on to do this.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.520]   That first epistle of John, which we read just now, tells us, "Believe not every spirit,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.960]   but try the spirits."
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.520]   So obviously when we are dealing with a spiritual witness and testimony such as this, we shall
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.800]   have to be careful to safeguard ourselves against a spurious or a false experience.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.240]   And we hope to do so.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.680]   And then we shall consider furthermore as to whether this is something that should be
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.480]   sought by God's children.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.240]   Now but before we do all that, it does seem to me that this is the point at which we should
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.320]   do something that I've been anxious to do from the very beginning.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.600]   And that is, I want to give you this evening, and probably all our time will be taken up
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.120]   with this, I want to give you testimonies to this teaching which we have here, as they
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   are to be found in the writings of prominent children of God in the 17th century, 18th
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   century and 19th century.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.320]   It is to me a very interesting thing that there seem to be a number of people who imagine
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   that in all I'm saying as an exposition of this verse is something new and strange.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.920]   That to me is quite astonishing, but it's very significant.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.400]   It is obvious that the teaching of this verse has been so neglected and been so misunderstood
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.880]   that when a true exposition of it is given, people are surprised and astonished, and rather
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.760]   feel that this is some innovation.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.840]   Now I want to show you that far from being an innovation, it is something that has been
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.220]   taught regularly throughout the centuries.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.880]   And it is only particularly in this present century that this teaching has dropped into
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.200]   the background, has been neglected and has been forgotten.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.080]   And I do not hesitate to assert, and that's why I'm spending so much time with this matter,
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.920]   I do not hesitate to assert that the main explanation and cause of the present state
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.680]   of the Christian Church, and I'm referring particularly now to evangelical churches,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.840]   is the neglect of this doctrine and that other doctrine with which we were dealing at length
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.800]   before Christmas, the doctrine which would have us take everything by faith and not be
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.840]   concerned at all about our feelings.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.960]   The prevailing current popular teaching concerning the Holy Spirit this century has been just
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.840]   that, that it's something that happens without your knowing it, and you mustn't be concerned
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   about your feelings whatsoever.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   You just take it by faith and you just go on thanking the Lord for it.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.680]   You must have had it because you believe God's word, so you've got it.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.280]   It's not anything experimental, it's something by which you live normally and go on living
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   in the same way.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.480]   Well, now then, I want to try to show you how all that, as I've been already trying
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.000]   to show in my exposition, is a complete violation of this teaching.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.840]   It is indeed almost a form of quenching the Spirit, and that's one of the most serious
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.160]   things of which God's people can ever be guilty.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.680]   Well, now then, let me proceed to do what I'm proposing to do.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.280]   I felt that perhaps the best way of giving you these quotations, these extracts, was
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.760]   to take it historically.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.200]   So we'll start right away back at the beginning of the 17th century.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now, here is a book in my hand, The Life of Robert Bruce, who was a minister of the Church
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   of Scotland.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.720]   He was the successor of John Knox in St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.360]   You can buy this book yourselves in the book room at the ridiculous price of two shillings.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.300]   But now listen to this.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:15.120]   In The Life of Robert Bruce, who was a mighty man of God, Scotch Presbyterian, theologian,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.700]   and so on.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   This is what he says.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.360]   He was writing a letter to somebody, and this is how he puts it.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.800]   I never got such access in my time as I have gotten since I went from you.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.400]   The treasures of his witches have been opened unto me.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.360]   There was never such foul flesh as gotten a more gracious, more sensible, more powerful
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.680]   approbation of my ministry in Edinburgh, of my fidelity therein.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:50.120]   This spirit hath testified to my spirit, not only by real joys, spiritual and elevated
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:58.200]   light, but by vocal speeches within me in the daylight, that I heard so sensibly, with
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   great effusion of tears, so far not only by approbation, but to my commendation, that
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:12.880]   I admire how he should bestow such gracious speeches upon so wretched creature as I was.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.760]   Indeed I grant the will was with me, but not so bent as it should have been neither, for
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   I was over-timorous and laden with diversity of infirmities, the spirit in some measure
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.640]   ready, but the flesh was weak.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:32.280]   Yet his majesty, my gracious God, my God in Christ, accepts of it, as it had been the
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.760]   most perfect and exact service in the world.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   Yea, I admire how so true a mouth could speak so far in approbation of a silly poor wretch.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.560]   My heart, howsoever Edinburgh has cast me off, rejected and banished me out of their
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.080]   parts, he was dismissed from Edinburgh, I leapt no sooner on my horse, but the gates
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.000]   of heaven were cast open to me.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.160]   I got such applause in my heart, with such floods of tears, with such real and constant
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.440]   approbation, that my heart could not wish for greater access.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.040]   And on the second day of the same month, I got another approbation in distinct terms,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:25.320]   the spirit testifying to my spirit so audibly as it were, that I admired how his majesty
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.480]   could make so much of so little doings and so mean service.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.680]   Now there is a door of Scotsman for you, not an excitable emotional person.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.440]   Scots Presbyterian at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.520]   Yet that is how he describes this spirit bearing witness with his spirit.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.800]   And you see that it's full of immersion and of feeling.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   He didn't take anything by faith, it happened to him, and that is how they all put it.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:05.120]   Now I take for my second a man whom I've already quoted, John Preston, who was court
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:14.040]   chaplain, you remember, to James I and Charles I, and a mighty intellect and great puritan
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   writer.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.360]   Again, as far removed as you can imagine of some excitable emotional ignorant person.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.320]   But this is how he puts it.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.200]   And I'm quoting out of his book which is the New Covenant of the Saints, Portion, and
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.760]   it was published in 1629.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.640]   By the way, the dates of Robert Bruce were 1554 to 1631.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.400]   Now then, here's John Preston.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.200]   He's talking about the sealing of the spirit, Ephesians 1, 13.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.840]   I've already quoted what comes before what I'm going to quote now to you.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.040]   He will say, "What is this seal or witness of the spirit?
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   My beloved, it is a thing that we cannot express.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:12.000]   It is a certain divine impression of light, a certain inexpressible assurance that we
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.360]   are the sons of God, a certain secret manifestation that God hath received us and put away our
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.880]   sins.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:28.040]   I say it is such a thing that no man knows but they that have it.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.800]   You shall find it expressed by all these places of Scripture.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.840]   Revelation 3, "If any man will open unto me, I will come in and sup with him."
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:43.120]   That is, when the Lord enters into a kind of familiarity with a man, when he vouchsafes
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.240]   him so much favor as to come and sup and dine with him, as it were, and to dwell with him,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.200]   and then he quotes other passages like import in Revelations 2.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:04.560]   So John 14, 21, "If any man love me and keep my commandments, I will show myself to him."
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:11.280]   That is, he shall have an extraordinary manifestation of myself.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.840]   He shall have such an expression of love and peace that shall fill his heart with peace
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.640]   and joy, such a thing that no man knows but himself.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   Beloved, this is the testimony of the Spirit.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.760]   I confess it is a wondrous thing, and if there were not some Christians that did feel it
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.480]   and know it, you might believe there were no such thing, that it were but a fancy or
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   enthusiasm.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   But it is certain there are a generation of men that know what this seal of the Lord
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   is.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.840]   Indeed, you must remember this to distinguish it from all fancies and delusions.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:03.960]   This Spirit comes after you have the water and the blood, after you are believers, after
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.200]   you have purged yourselves.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.440]   And therefore if a man have flashes of light and joy, that witness that he hath received
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   the promise, and that he is in the covenant, and for all this he hath not the things that
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:23.560]   go before it, he may well take it for a delusion, saith Christ, I will come and sup with him,
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   but with whom?
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.280]   With him that first openeth to me.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.560]   Now there, you see, is a great and a mighty statement from John Preston.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.240]   But let me give you another from John Preston.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   There I was quoting him on pages 398 to the top of page 400, but I'm going to quote him
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:50.480]   now on pages 416 and to the top of page 417 in the same work.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:13:00.800]   "Now when the Lord seeth a man believing thus, and trusting him upon his bare word,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.000]   then the Lord goes a step further with him, and seals the same things to him with the
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.440]   Spirit of promise, as I showed before out of Ephesians 1.13.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   When you put to your seal that God is true, then God then comes and puts to his seal,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.240]   he gives you the Spirit of promise, and assures you that it is so.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:35.440]   That is, he doth by his own Spirit say to a man's soul, I am thy salvation.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.040]   My beloved, this is a certain expression of the Holy Ghost to the soul of a man that we
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.400]   know not how to express to you.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.640]   Therefore it is called the hidden manner.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.760]   It is called a white stone, a certain manifestation of Christ to the soul, a certain divine light,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.280]   a certain secret token of his love whereby Christ manifests himself to the soul of a
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.320]   man, that which the scriptures call supping with him.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.080]   This is the witness of the Spirit, that when the witness of our own spirit is somewhat
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:19.320]   obscure, we may then say, Lord, thou now speakest plainly, now there is no question.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.760]   My beloved, this is the witness of the Spirit.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.160]   Well there is the great John Preston.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.920]   Now I come next to another Puritan of the name of Thomas Horton, who preached 46 sermons
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.280]   on this eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, and they were published in 1674.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.640]   And this is what he's got to say on our verse.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.480]   He says, "Whenever it comes in the reality and the fullness of it, and so long as it
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:57.000]   remains upon the soul, it silences all objections, scatters all temptations, removes all scruples
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.640]   and doubts whatsoever to the contrary, and sets the heart at perfect rest," he says,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.920]   "it is something secret and inexpressible."
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.080]   He says, "It is certain and at the same time infallible."
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.680]   Now my next is again a man of the same century, the seventeenth century, and again I go to
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Scotland.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.600]   Here is a man called William Guthrie, who wrote a book called The Christian's Saving
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   Interest.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   It's a very great and famous and classical book.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.520]   This is how Guthrie puts it.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.160]   I speak with the experience of many saints, and I hope according to the scripture, if
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.760]   I say there is a communication of the Spirit of God which is sometimes most safe to some
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:51.720]   of his people, that is somewhat besides, if not beyond, that witnessing of a sonship spoken
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   of before.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.320]   That's what we've been saying.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.480]   This is over and above the fifteenth verse.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.320]   It is a glorious, divine manifestation of God unto the soul, shedding abroad God's love
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.880]   in the heart.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.280]   It is a thing better felt than spoken of.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   It is no audible voice, but it is a ray of glory, filling the soul with God as he is
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.000]   life, light, love, and liberty.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.360]   Corresponding to that audible voice, "O men greatly beloved," Daniel 9, 23.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.080]   Putting a man into a transport with this on his heart.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.320]   It is good to be here, Matthew 17, 4.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:43.480]   It is that which went out from Christ to Mary when he but mentioned her name.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.640]   Jesus saith unto her, "Mary."
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.400]   She turned herself and saith unto him, "Rabboni," which is to say, "Master."
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.220]   He had spoken some words to her before, and she understood not that it was he.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:03.400]   But when he uttered this one word, "Mary," there was some admirable, divine conveyance
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:10.480]   and manifestation made out unto her heart, by which she was so satisfyingly filled that
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.100]   there was no place for arguing and disputing whether or not that was Christ, and if she
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.280]   had any interest in him.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.400]   That manifestation wrought faith to itself, and it purchased credit and trust to itself,
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.920]   and was equivalent with, "Thus saith the Lord."
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:34.160]   This is such a glance of glory that it may in the highest sense be called the earnest
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.080]   or firstfruits of the inheritance, Ephesians 1, 14.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:46.560]   For it is a present and, as it were, sensible discovery of the Holy God, almost wholly
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:54.240]   conforming the man unto his likeness, so swallowing him up that he forgetteth all things except
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.120]   the present manifestation.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.840]   Oh, how glorious is this manifestation of the Spirit!
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:09.240]   Faith here riseth to so full an assurance that it resolveth wholly into the sensible
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.180]   presence of God.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:17.440]   This is the thing which doth best deserve the title of "sensible presence," and is
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.960]   not given unto all believers.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   Some whereof are all their days under bondage and in fear, Hebrews 2, 15.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.820]   But here love, almost perfect, casteth out fear, 1 John 4, 18.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:38.480]   This is so absolutely let out upon the Master's pleasure, and so transient or passing, or
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.120]   quickly gone when it is, that no man may bring his gracious state into debate for want of
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   it.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:53.200]   Well, now there is again William Guth, as far as you can imagine, from some just unintelligent,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.320]   unintellectual, emotional, flippant type of person.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:05.040]   And then I go for my next to another great Puritan, Richard Sibbes, who used to preach
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.640]   in Grey's Inn here in London to the lawyers and the barristers and the solicitors, and
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.960]   was known as the Heavenly Dr. Sibbes.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.400]   Again, great intellect, a man who gave so much to so many of the other Puritans.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.520]   Now this is how Sibbes puts it.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.160]   I'm reading out of his work called "A Fountain Sealed."
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.480]   Those of you who have got his works will find it in Volume 5, page 440.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:39.680]   But oft it falls out that our own spirits, though sanctified, can extend against a subtle
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.920]   temptation strongly enforced.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.000]   God superads his own spirit.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.600]   Guilt often prevails over the testimony of blood.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.840]   That of water, by reason of stirring corruptions, runneth troubled.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:01.080]   For the third, the immediate testimony of the Spirit, is necessary to witness the Father's
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:09.960]   love to us, to us in particular saying, "I am thy salvation, thy sins are pardoned."
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.160]   And this testimony the word echoeth unto, and the heart is stirred up and comforted
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.960]   with joy inexpressible.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:24.640]   So that both our spirits and consciences, and the Spirit of Christ, joining in one,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.120]   strongly witness our condition in grace that we are the sons of God.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.760]   Then he goes on again, "The Spirit it is that witnesses with blood, and witnesses with
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:42.320]   water, and by water, whatsoever of Christ's is applied unto us by the Spirit.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   But besides witnessing with these witnesses, the Spirit hath a distinct witness by way
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.120]   of enlarging the soul, which is joy in the apprehension of God's fatherly love, and
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.040]   Christ's setting the soul at liberty.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:04.000]   The Spirit doth not always witness unto us our condition by force of argument from sanctification,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.440]   but sometimes immediately by way of presence, as the sight of a friend comforts without
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440]   help of discourse."
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.240]   Now that's very good.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.160]   Sometimes a friend helps you, but it doesn't say a word, it's mere presence.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.400]   The Spirit, he says, sometimes does that.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.040]   The very joy from sight prevents the use of discourse.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.440]   "This testimony of the Spirit containeth in it the force of all, word, promise, oath,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.620]   seal, etc.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:39.680]   This is greater than the promise, as a seal is more than our hand, and as an oath is more
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.800]   than a man's bare word.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.080]   The same that is said of God's oath in comparison with his bare promise may be said of this
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:53.360]   sealing, in comparison of other testimonies, that as God was more willing, more abundantly
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.520]   to declare to the heirs of promise their salvation, he added an oath."
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   Hebrews 6, 18.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:07.840]   So, "For the same end he addeth this, his Spirit, as a seal to the promise and to the
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.280]   other testimonies."
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.600]   Our own graces indeed, if we were watchful enough, would satisfy us.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.720]   "The fountain is open to Hagar, but she seeth it not."
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.480]   Genesis 21, 17.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.720]   "Howsoever, the Spirit, if that cometh, it subdueth all doubt.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.960]   As God in his oath and swearing joineth none to himself, but sweareth by himself, so in
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.320]   this witness he taketh in no other testimony to confirm it, but witnesseth by himself.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   And hence ariseth joy unspeakable and glorious," 1 Peter 1, 8.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.760]   "And peace which passeth all understanding.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.880]   For it is an extract of heaven when we see our being in the state of grace, not in the
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.080]   effect only, but as in the breast and bosom of God."
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.400]   Well, there is the quotation from Richard Thibbs.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.600]   Let me give you one more from this same century.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.840]   I have two more from this century.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.440]   One is a man called Edward Elton, who again preached on this Roman date and published
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.480]   his work in 1623.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.840]   This is how he puts it.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.960]   "I take it therefore that the witness and testimony of the Spirit here spoken of is
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:30.280]   an inward, secret, and unspeakable inspiration of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God inwardly,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:36.880]   secretly, and in an unspeakable manner, informing our hearts and inwardly persuading us that
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.360]   God is our Father, and pouring into our heart a secret, wonderful, and unspeakable sweet
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.320]   sense and feeling of God's love to us.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.360]   Not of God's ordinary or common love, but of his special and fatherly love, that God
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.400]   loves us with such love as he dares to his only begotten Son, Christ Jesus, in whom we
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.160]   are adopted to be his children, as the Lord Jesus himself speaks in that excellent prayer
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:10.000]   of his, John 17, 23, that God loves us, we believing in Christ as he hath loved him.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.400]   And to this purpose the apostle speaks plainly, Romans 5, 5, the Holy Spirit of God given
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:23.480]   to us doth infuse and pour into our hearts a sense and feeling of God's love to us in
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   Christ."
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.280]   Now I come to my last in this century from Thomas Goodwin.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:37.200]   You will find this in Goodwin's first volume, in which he is expanding Ephesians 1, 13.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:44.760]   Goodwin puts it like this, "There is a light that cometh and overpowereth a man's soul,
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:52.280]   and assureth him that God is his, and he is God's, and that God loveth him from everlasting.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.240]   It is a light beyond the light of ordinary faith, the next thing to heaven.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.000]   Yea, you have no more, you can have no more, till you come thither.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.040]   It is faith elevated and raised up above its ordinary rate.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.640]   It is the electing love of God brought home to the soul."
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.320]   There are many other quotations I could give you from Goodwin, but we must leave it at
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.440]   that for this evening.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.360]   Now then, I leave the seventeenth century at that.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.840]   There are more I could give you.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   We have just got to select tonight.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.600]   Let's move on to the eighteenth century.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.280]   And here, of course, we come to a number of great names.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.360]   Let us start, perhaps, with Whitefield himself.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.600]   Listen to him.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.320]   Soon after this, he says in his journals, "I found and felt in myself that I was delivered
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.080]   from the burden that had so heavily oppressed me.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.280]   The spirit of mourning was taken from me, and I knew what it was truly to rejoice in
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.100]   God my Saviour, and for some time could not avoid singing psalms wherever I was.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:05.600]   But my joy gradually became more settled, and blessed be God, as a burden increased
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.920]   in myself, saving a few casual intermissions ever since.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.240]   Thus were the days of my mourning ended.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.480]   After a long night of desertion and temptation, the star which I had seen at a distance before
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.160]   began to appear again, and the day star arose in my heart.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:33.520]   Now did the Spirit of God take possession of my soul, and, as I humbly hope, seal me
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.380]   up the day unto the day of redemption, having now obtained mercy from God and received the
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.040]   spirit of adoption in my heart.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:50.440]   My friends were surprised to see me look and behave so cheerfully after the many reports
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.720]   they had had concerning me."
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.800]   Now there is one quotation from Whitefield, but listen to another.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:06.040]   Whitefield writes a thing like this, "Was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.920]   Oh, that all who deny the promise of the Father might thus receive it themselves.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:19.200]   Oh, that all were partakers of my joy."
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.600]   But listen to him once more, describing something that happened on November 5, 1740.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   You will find it in his journals.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.840]   Mr. Gilbert Tennant preached first, and I then began to pray and gave an exhortation.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.200]   In about six minutes, one cried out, "He is come!
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.800]   He is come!" and could scarce sustain the manifestation of Jesus to his soul.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.720]   The eager crying of others for the like favor obliged me to stop, and I prayed over them
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.040]   as I saw their agonies and distress increase.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.520]   At length we sang a hymn and then retired to the house, where the men that received
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.400]   Christ continued praising and speaking of him till near midnight.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.080]   My own soul was so full that I retired and wept before the Lord under a deep sense of
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.520]   my own vileness and His sovereignty and the greatness of God's everlasting love.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.160]   Most of the people spent the remainder of the night in prayer and praises.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.080]   It was a night much to be remembered.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.960]   Then I read another extract, November 22, 1740.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   "God's presence so filled my soul that I could scarce stand under it."
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.640]   I remember another occasion on which he tells us that he was so tired and exhausted that
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.400]   he went to lie down in a bed.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.920]   But the Holy Spirit was so pouring the love of God into his heart that he could not sleep,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.120]   though he was virtually, physically, entirely exhausted.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   Well there are some extracts from the great and mighty George Whitfield.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.280]   Let me read you something now from Jonathan Edwards.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:14.640]   As I rode out into the woods for my health in 1737, having alighted from my horse in
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.160]   a retired place, as my manner commonly has been, to walk for divine contemplation and
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:27.760]   prayer, I had a view that was for me extraordinary of the glory of the Son of God as mediated
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:35.560]   between God and men and His wonderful, great, full, pure, and sweet grace and love and meek
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.400]   and gentle condescension.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.560]   The grace that appeared so calm and sweet appeared also great above the heavens.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   The person of Christ appeared ineffably excellent, with an excellency great enough to swallow
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.240]   up all thoughts and conceptions, which continued as near as I can judge about an hour, which
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.480]   kept me a greater part of the time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.880]   I felt an urgency of soul to be what I know not how otherwise to express, than emptied
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.720]   and annihilated, to lie in the dust and to be full of Christ alone, to love Him with
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.800]   a holy and pure love, to trust in Him, to live upon Him, to serve Him, and to be perfectly
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.160]   sanctified and made pure with a divine and heavenly purity.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.440]   Now that's Jonathan Edwards, perhaps the brightest intellect that has ever appeared
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.480]   in the United States of America.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.880]   A giant intellect, yet you notice he doesn't take it by faith, he's overwhelmed, he's
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.600]   weeping, he's crying, overcome by the greatness of the glory that was revealed to him.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.880]   But lest somebody might think that this is something that is given only to preachers
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.900]   or even to men, let me tell you something about Mrs. Jonathan Edwards.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:31:02.000]   This is what happened to her, and it happened to her in 1742.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.400]   I cannot find language to express how certain the everlasting love of God appeared.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.260]   The everlasting mountains and hills were but shadows to it.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:20.780]   My safety and happiness and eternal enjoyment of God's immutable love seemed as durable
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.920]   and unchangeable as God himself.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:30.400]   Melted and overcome by the sweetness of this assurance, I fell into a great flow of tears
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.120]   and could not forbear weeping aloud.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.240]   The presence of God was so near and so real that I seemed scarcely conscious of anything
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   else.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:46.920]   At night, my soul seemed to be filled with an inexpressibly sweet and pure love to God
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.320]   and to the children of God, with a refreshing consolation and solace of soul which made
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.640]   me willing to lie on the earth at the feet of the servants of God to declare his gracious
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:03.680]   dealings with me and breathe forth before them my love and gratitude and praise.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.800]   All night I continued in a constant, clear, and lively sense of the heavenly sweetness
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   of Christ's excellent and transcendent love, of his nearness to him and of my dearness
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:23.640]   to him, with an inexpressibly sweet calmness of soul in an entire rest in him.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   My soul remained in a heavenly elision.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.000]   I think what I felt each minute during the continuance of the whole time worth more than
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.040]   all the outward comfort and pleasure which I had enjoyed in my whole life put together.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:48.240]   This exaltation of soul subsided into a heavenly calm and rest of soul in God which was even
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.480]   sweeter than what preceded it.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.320]   I would emphasize that that happened to her in 1742, whereas the great revival had broken
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:01.800]   out under her husband's ministry in Northampton in 1734 and 1735.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   She had been a believer and had had great experiences long before this.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.160]   Well there is the story of Mrs. Jonathan Edwards.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.720]   Now let us go on with our list.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.080]   I hope nobody is tired of this.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.320]   I think this is wonderful.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.560]   So now let me go on.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   Let us cross the ocean.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.880]   We will come back from the United States.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:33.040]   Let us come back first of all to England and to John Wesley.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.640]   You see it does not matter what view of theology you take.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.240]   They all say the same thing.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.000]   It is something, says John Wesley, immediate and direct, not the result of reflection or
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   argumentation.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.040]   There may be foretastes of joy, of peace, of love, and these not delusive, but really
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:59.800]   from God, long before we have the witness in ourselves, before the Spirit of God witnesses
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:07.960]   with our spirits that we have redemption in the blood of Jesus, even forgiveness of sins.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.600]   Well there is John Wesley.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.480]   Now I come for my next, as I say, still in this country, but you have to go to the west
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.360]   to a country which is called Wales.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:33.640]   And here we have again something which is very striking and very remarkable.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.440]   I have had to translate this.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:43.280]   It is in a book on the beginning of Methodism in Wales by a man called Richard Bennett.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.800]   This is how I have translated what you read on pages 50 and 51.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:53.360]   It is about Howell Harris, one of the two great leaders in the Methodist awakening and
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.120]   revival in Wales two hundred years ago, a great friend of Whitefield, the man who used
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.480]   to deputize for Whitefield here in Whitefield's tabernacle when Whitefield was away.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.520]   And the man was at the center of that great movement, a great friend of both Wesleys also.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.480]   Now then, this is what I read about him.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:25.480]   This man Howell Harris came under conviction in the Easter, Good Friday service of 1735.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:35.160]   He remained under conviction until the following Whit Sunday, when he got not only to believe
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   that his sins were forgiven, but was given assurance.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.140]   Let me read to you.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.360]   After his conviction, he recorded everything.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:50.000]   He could do that without any offense to the reader at first, because his heart was dancing
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.160]   in the warmth of his first love.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:58.880]   You see, he was given assurance on Whit Sunday, 1735.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:06.840]   And after two to three weeks, now this is two to three weeks after Whit Sunday, that
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:13.440]   love which had caused him before, you see, to be dancing in his first love, after two
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:23.680]   to three weeks, that love burst forth into flame, a flame which melted his whole nature.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.640]   The experience of forgiveness which he had had in the church at Talgoth was undoubtedly
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.980]   sweet.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.120]   That was Whit Sunday.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:44.680]   Nevertheless, it left in his heart an indefinable sense of some further need.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:51.360]   But while he was engaged in secret prayer in the church at Fangastie, now this is two
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:37:00.440]   to three weeks after Whit Sunday, that sacred place where he had given himself to God, now
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.520]   God gave himself to him.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.320]   He had gone, you see, into the tower of the church at this place called Fangastie to read
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.000]   his Bible and to pray secretly so that nobody should disturb him.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.480]   And it was while he was there that, as we are told, God now gave himself to him.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.960]   And then the writer quotes two lines of poetry which I have translated like this.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:30.920]   Prayer was satisfied his longing, great and urgent plea, every need supplied completely
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.560]   by the Godhead, one in three.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.360]   The writer goes on, referring to Harris's own account of this in his diaries, he piles
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.240]   the richest biblical phrases, one on top of the other, in an attempt to give adequate
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.320]   expression to what he felt and experienced that day.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:57.800]   That was when his heart was cleansed from all idols and the love of God was shed abroad
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   in his heart.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.120]   Christ had entered in before, but now he began to sup.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.480]   You see, they all quote this.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.640]   Christ had entered in before, but now he began to sup.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.400]   Now he had received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.720]   And he began to desire to depart and to be with Christ.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.880]   All fears were cast out for months and perfect love took their place.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:27.480]   Then later on, I read this, a quotation from his diaries on page 54.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.800]   Harris says, "Were it not for that love I had experienced, I would have drawn back,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   I would have given up.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.480]   I could never have struggled against the flood.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:46.520]   Love fell in showers on my soul so that I could scarce contain and control myself.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:52.440]   I knew no fear and had no doubt whatsoever as to my salvation."
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   But this is interesting.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:02.560]   You find a year later, in 1736, a statement like this in the same book.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   He refers frequently to a spiritual feast which he had about this time on a certain
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   mountain, which the name is given, while he was returning from Kum-Yai.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.680]   When he saw God smiling upon him in such a manner that his heart was shattered under
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:29.720]   the powerful influences of the divine love, this place became for him ever afterwards
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.920]   a holy mountain.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.160]   But I was most fascinated to find this, not in this book now, but in some of the extracts
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.760]   from his diaries that have been recently printed.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:49.160]   On June 18, 1746, he was in London.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.440]   This is what he puts, "London, a day to me memorable.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:03.120]   This day, eleven years ago, I was sealed to the day of redemption."
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.360]   In other words, you see, on June 18, 1746, he remembers what had happened on June 18,
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.680]   1745, in the tower of the church at Langhastie, when the Spirit for the first time bore witness
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.920]   with his spirit that he was indeed a child of God.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.600]   He keeps on referring to it.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.880]   Every time that date comes around, "a day to me memorable."
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   He never forgot it.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:33.680]   It was the first occasion on which he had experienced this great effusion of the Spirit.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.920]   Well there is the testimony of Howell Harris.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.800]   Now let me come right to the end of that century, the end of the 18th and the beginning of the
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   19th.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.880]   You have heard of primitive Methodism.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.680]   Well it was started really by a man called Hugh Bourne, the man who held that great meeting
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.520]   on Moe Cop and led to the beginning of primitive Methodism.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.120]   Now here is an account of what happened to him.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.200]   It's the same kind of experience.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.400]   He again had retired for some meditation and study of the Scripture, when suddenly the
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.640]   glory of God appeared to him in an overwhelming power.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.240]   I won't read the quotation to you as I see my time has gone.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.720]   Let me give you one other.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.680]   I must read you the experience of a man called Christmas Evans, one of the great Baptist
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.200]   preachers of the beginning of the 19th century.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.560]   He had been in a dry, arid state of soul for years, but then he says, "On a day ever to
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.160]   be remembered by me, as I was going from Dolgeti to Machynlleth and climbing up towards Cadder
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:47.640]   Idris, I considered it incumbent on me to pray, however hard I felt my heart and however
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.600]   worldly the frame of my spirit was.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:57.000]   Having begun in the name of Jesus, I soon felt as it were my fetters loosening and the
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.880]   old hardness softening.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.560]   And as I thought the mountains of frost and snow dissolving and melting within me, this
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.720]   engendered confidence in my soul in the promise of the Holy Ghost.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.080]   I felt my whole mind relieved from some great bondage.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:21.960]   Tears flowed copiously, and I was constrained to cry out for the gracious visits of God
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.040]   by restoring to my soul the joy of his salvation, and that he would visit the churches in Anglesey
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.400]   that were under my care."
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.240]   And God answered his prayers very abundantly.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.680]   Now let me read to you something about another American called Edward Payson at the beginning
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.800]   of this 19th century.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.820]   Here's another Presbyterian minister.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.820]   He was on his deathbed.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.120]   He was asked, "Do you feel reconciled?"
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.880]   "Oh," he said, "that is too cold.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:43:01.720]   I rejoice, I triumph, and this happiness will endure as long as God himself, for it consists
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.080]   in admiring and adoring him.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.480]   I can find no words to express my happiness.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:17.680]   I seem to be swimming in a river of pleasure which is carrying me on to the great fountain."
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.280]   That is Edward Payson on his deathbed.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.160]   Now I'm sure that many of you have often seen volumes on the history of the Reformation
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.080]   by a man called Merle d'Aubigné.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:39.000]   He was a Swiss, and he is the great author of that famous history of the Reformation.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.880]   But let me read to you now what happened to this man and some friends of his.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.000]   This is the story.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.320]   Several years after his conversion, when at Kiel, in company with the Rev. Frederick
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.880]   Monod of Paris and the Rev. C. Riel of Jutland and Planck, a biblical professor of the university
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:05.640]   there, in the course of their conversation upon the Scriptures, the aged professor refused
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:12.040]   to enter into any detailed solution of difficulties presented, saying that the first step was
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:20.120]   to be firmly settled in the grace of Christ, and that the light which proceeds from him
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.480]   will disperse all darkness.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:29.720]   We were studying, says d'Aubigné, the epistle to the Ephesians, and had got to the end of
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.320]   the third chapter.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.040]   When we read the last two verses, "Now unto him that can do exceeding abundance above
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.560]   all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us," this expression
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.320]   "fell upon my soul as a revelation from God.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.040]   He can do, by his power, I said to myself, above all that we ask, above all even that
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.320]   we think, nay exceeding abundantly above all.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:59.600]   A full trust in Christ for the work to be done in my poor heart now filled my soul.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.120]   We knelt together in prayer.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.600]   When I arose, I felt as if my wings had been renewed as the eagle's.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.360]   All my doubts were removed, my anguish was quelled, and the Lord extended peace to me
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   as a river.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.480]   Then I could comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and depth and length and height,
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.720]   and know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   Then was I able to say, Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   with thee."
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.480]   Then goes on the author, under the influence of that baptism of the Spirit, "D'Aubigné
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.840]   wrote the history of the Reformation, the most spiritual history ever penned outside
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   the Bible."
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.240]   Now, there is a statement from that type of man.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   Let me give you one other from about this time, which to me, again, is most interesting
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.960]   and most important.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:46:01.000]   Many of you will know the strict Baptist denomination, largely started, you remember, by a man of
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.120]   the name of J.C. Philpott.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.800]   I've already quoted Philpott, but there was a man who was acting as assistant to Philpott.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.440]   He was the assistant editor, co-editor with J.C. Philpott, of the Gospel Standard from
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.480]   1840 to 1849.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:24.120]   Now, you may think of our friends the strict Baptist as being unusually serious and sober
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.600]   people, not given to immersionism, and you're perfectly right.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.720]   But listen to what this man says.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:36.000]   It's the most striking statement of his.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.880]   This is available, as I told you the other night.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.800]   It's the reprint of a sermon which he preached on Ephesians 1, 13 and 14.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.520]   Here he's dealing with the ceiling.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:49.160]   "As to the immediate act of this ceiling on the heart and the peculiar feelings under
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.000]   it, they are better known and understood by the squeak experience of them than can be
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.320]   conveyed by words or conceived in ideas.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.840]   I shall, however, endeavor to speak of it briefly and plainly according to the manner
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.760]   that the Blessed Spirit was pleased to impress upon my soul with it after he had prepared
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.600]   me for it."
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:13.360]   The Spirit is not confined to any particular means in giving this rich blessing.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.960]   He may give it under the preaching or reading of the Word or neither.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.760]   We've already agreed about that.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   But whatever outward means he may please to use, or should he, without any, come suddenly
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:32.920]   and sufferingly down upon the heart, the soul will feel fully assured it is the Blessed
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.440]   Spirit within him.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.800]   Nor is it anything in us or done by us that thus causes the Blessed Spirit to descend
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   upon the heart.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.920]   It is the will and work of his own good pleasure, Philippians 2, 13, in his own set time to
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   favor Zion.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.400]   Thus saith the Lord God.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.960]   I do not this for your sake or the house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.040]   The sealing in the text is the earnest of the heavenly inheritance, which is a part
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:07.880]   and pledge of the immortal glory of God in Christ, sealed or impressed upon the heart
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.800]   by the Holy Ghost.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.200]   And when the Spirit seals the heart with this blessed seal, he descends and softens and
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:21.840]   anoints it and sheds abroad therein the love and rich mercy of God and the life and love
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.600]   and blood and death of Jesus, so that the heart will be dissolved and overwhelmed, the
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.120]   soul melted in the flames of love, mercy, grace, glory, and heavenly blessedness, and
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.360]   the eyes flowing with tears of love and joy.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.360]   Every attribute of God is endeared to the heart till it burns with love to him.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.600]   And this feeling contains a peculiar heavenly and secret delight and blessedness, and it
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:55.240]   will be so powerfully and sensibly felt on the heart that it will be enjoyed as the earnest
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:01.120]   of immortal glory, a part of that glory that the souls of the redeemed will enjoy to all
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   eternity.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.200]   And the feeling is so distinct and powerful that it bears evidence to the heart of its
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   own divinity, and that it is the blessed sealing of the Spirit, the earnest pledge and foretest
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.240]   of heaven.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:17.800]   It brings with it assurance, pardon, and peace with God, and joy unspeakable and full of
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.000]   glory rises out of it.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.720]   He feels that the blessed Spirit has come down and taken possession of his heart and
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:30.040]   consecrated it as a sacred place to God and sealed him up as his own property into the
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.440]   day of redemption.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.640]   He feels he is the temple of the Holy Ghost and that the Spirit of God dwells in him and
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.420]   the glory of the Lord has filled the house.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:47.520]   He feels that part of heaven is let down into his soul, and all the peculiar, inexpressible,
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   sweet feelings of love, gratitude, contrition, and humility mingle together, which fill the
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   heart.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.040]   He feels no sin, guilt, wrath, or fears.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.360]   These are all put away.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.440]   A sweet peace and calmness rest in his mind.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:10.180]   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost have taken up their abode with him.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.860]   We will come unto him and make our abode with him.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:18.480]   It couches in it the love of God shed abroad in the heart, the spirit of adoption crying
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.780]   Abba Father, the spirit bearing witness to our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:29.980]   And this causes the soul sweetly to rest in God, satisfied with his salvation and delighted
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.060]   with the abundance of his glory.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:37.940]   He now understands in a sweet measure that precious scripture, "Now he which establisheth
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:44.020]   us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God, who hath also sealed us and given
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.100]   the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.960]   2 Corinthians 1, 21, 22.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:56.540]   This sealing enlarges the heart, enlightens the eyes, instructs the understanding, and
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:04.300]   puts into the soul a meek independence of men and things.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.340]   So John McKenzie.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.420]   I haven't time to quote to you Charles G. Finney.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.740]   If you've got his autobiography, read it and you'll find the account that he gives
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.180]   of how it came to him.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.020]   I will just quote you because it's a brief one what D.L.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.180]   Moody has got to say about this.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:26.380]   He says, "I began to cry as never before.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.540]   The hunger increased.
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.820]   I really felt that I did not want to live any longer if I could not have the power for
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.820]   service.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.380]   I kept on crying all the time that God would fill me with his Spirit.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:45.300]   Well, one day in the city of New York, oh what a day!
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.340]   I cannot describe it.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.240]   I seldom refer to it.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.460]   It is almost too sacred an experience to name.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.260]   Paul had an experience of which he never spoke for fourteen years.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:05.860]   I can only say, God revealed himself to me and I had such an experience of his love that
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:11.620]   I had to ask him to stay his hand."
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.140]   That's Moody describing the same thing.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:19.260]   My final quotation again comes from Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.900]   And with this I must let you go.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.060]   These quotations are endless.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.060]   I'm simply choosing some of them.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.940]   Here it is out of a sermon by Spurgeon on fellowship with God.
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:39.100]   "But you know, brethren, the word fellowship not only signifies concord of heart, but it
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:47.100]   implies a carrying out of that concord a little further in converse or mutual communication.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.900]   May the Holy Spirit grant that we may not say a word which is not strictly verified
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:56.700]   by our experience, but I hope we can say we have had converse with the Divine Father.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:00.180]   We have not seen him at any time, nor have we beheld his shape.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.800]   He does not been given to us like Moses to be put in the cleft of the rock and to see
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.360]   the back paths or the train of the invisible Jehovah.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.340]   But yet we have spoken to him, we have said to him, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:18.420]   We have saluted him in that title which came from our very heart, 'Our Father who art in
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   heaven.'
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:23.940]   We have had access to him in such a way that we cannot have been deceived.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:30.580]   We have found him, and through the precious blood of Christ we have come even unto his
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.580]   feet.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:37.340]   We have ordered our cause before him, and we have filled our mouth with arguments.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:43.180]   Nor has the speaking been all on our side, for he has been pleased to shed abroad by
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:47.060]   his Spirit his love in our hearts.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.220]   While we have felt the Spirit of adoption, he on the other hand has showed to us the
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.980]   loving kindness of a tender Father.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:58.200]   We have felt, though no sound was heard.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:04.020]   We have known, though no angelic messenger gave us witness, that his Spirit did bear
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:09.140]   witness with our spirits that we are born of God.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.580]   We were embraced of him, no more at a distance.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.100]   We were brought nigh by the blood of Christ.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:21.780]   I trust my brothers and sisters, you can each of you say, though you wish it could be more
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:29.820]   intense than it is, I have in all these things had fellowship with the Father, for I have
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:35.220]   conversed with him, and he has spoken to me.
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:41.900]   Then listen to a final word from Spurgeon in this volume of Revival, your sermons preached
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.100]   by him and published last year.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:52.340]   Let me say now, before I turn from this point, that it is possible for a man to know whether
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:58.180]   God has called him or not, and he may know it too beyond a doubt.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:03.100]   He may know it as surely as if he had read it with his own eyes; nay, he may know it
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.340]   more surely than that.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:10.700]   For if I read a thing with my eyes, even my eyes may deceive me, the testimony of sense
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:17.540]   may be false, but the testimony of the Spirit must be true.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:23.780]   We have the witness of the Spirit within, bearing witness with our spirits that we are
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.820]   born of God.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:31.660]   There is such a thing on earth as an infallible assurance of our election.
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:36.260]   Let a man once get that, and it will anoint his head with fresh oil, it will clothe him
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:40.420]   with a white garment of praise, and put the song of the angel into his mouth.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.340]   Happy, happy men, who is fully assured of his interest in the covenant of grace, in
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.580]   the blood of atonement, and in the glories of heaven, such men there are here this very
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.580]   day.
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:56:01.460]   Let them rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:06.340]   Like the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, I am tempted to say, and what shall I more
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   say?
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.940]   The time fails me.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.100]   I have given you but a few extracts.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:16.780]   Thus you see that in different centuries, in different places, men and women of different
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:22.940]   types of temperament and everything else, men of unusual ability and learning, men who
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:28.620]   kept a strict control over their feelings, remote from excitability and superficiality,
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:36.460]   they all with one accord bear the same testimony as to what happens when the Spirit beareth
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:42.580]   witness with your spirit that you are indeed a child of God.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:47.580]   Very well, as I said at the beginning, next Friday evening, God willing, we shall go on.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:53.620]   Now having thus supported what we have been trying to say feebly with these great authorities,
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:59.300]   we shall go on to consider further aspects of this great and glorious question.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:05.420]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:09.620]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:15.620]   Now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:28.180]   of pilgrimage, and until we shall see Him face to face as He is and be like Him in glory.
