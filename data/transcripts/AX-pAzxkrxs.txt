[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Well, God sustains, upholds, and governs over everything that he makes, leading it all to
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.680]   its intended end.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.360]   This is the theme of Pastor John's wonderful new book, Providence.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360]   His truth is so glorious.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.680]   I mean, we are meant to see and savor it for ourselves so deeply that it changes our lives.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.600]   And so, we're celebrating these implications on Wednesdays, and there's a total of 10 of
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   them.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.520]   In episode 1589, we looked at how the precious providence of God means that in the suffering
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.340]   of Christians, neither Satan, nor man, nor nature, nor chance is wielding decisive control.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.120]   God is sovereign over all of our suffering.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   And that means none of our suffering is meaningless.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.440]   It's always purposeful.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.120]   It's always measured.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120]   Always wise.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.380]   Always loving.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.080]   Always working for us an eternal weight of glory.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.220]   That was implication number six.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.560]   Here now with implication number seven is Pastor John.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.000]   The seventh real life effect of seeing and savoring the all-pervading, all-embracing,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.360]   all-governing providence of God is that it makes us alert and resistant to man-centered
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   substitutes that pose as good news but are false alternatives to the God-centered vision
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.400]   of reality and salvation in the Bible.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320]   Let me say it another way.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.120]   There is something about the embrace, the joyful, heartfelt, intelligent embrace of
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.560]   this radically God-centered, God-exalting, God-besotted view of all things that creates
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   a kind of theological antibody against man-centered diseases, false teachings that make too much
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.920]   of man and too little of God.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.720]   All faith in the all-governing providence of God is like a spiritual inoculation or
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.400]   immunization against much false teaching.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.920]   And what a gift, what a benefit that is to the church and to the human soul.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.760]   History seems to show that this is so.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   For example, as Ian Murray describes in his biography of Jonathan Edwards, toward the
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.880]   end of the 18th century convictions about God's all-governing providence and other
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.400]   God-centered doctrines waned.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.160]   They declined in North America.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   It was the spirit of the age to stress less God's sovereignty and more man's autonomy.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.440]   In the progress of this departure from biblical providence after the Great Awakening, those
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.400]   congregational churches of New England, which came to embrace views of man's own powers
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.440]   as decisive rather than God's powers as decisive, those churches gradually moved into
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.820]   Unitarianism, which denied the deity of Christ, and into Universalism, which basically said
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.160]   that all the face of the world are going to lead people to heaven.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.200]   And much of the deep secularism that one finds in New England to this very day traces its
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.840]   roots back to this process.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.800]   In other words, a deep, strong conviction about the all-governing providence of God
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   can be lost.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.840]   It can.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   No doctrinal allegiance guarantees protection from spiritual decay.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.240]   Only God himself can keep the heart from drifting away and keep it true.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:26.120]   But what the history shows is that while there is conviction about God's all-governing
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:34.840]   providence and while there's love for this beautiful doctrine, there is a spiritual and
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.740]   theological barrier against drifting into false man-centered substitutes.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.520]   It seems that there is something about the truth of God's all-embracing providence
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.360]   that stands guard over the mind and heart and keeps her, the heart, alert and keeps
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.400]   the church alert to tendencies and shifts that swing wide from the plumb line of God's
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Word.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.880]   You can read about the same process in J.I.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.920]   Packer's Quest for Godliness.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.880]   I've written down here, page 160, where he describes how Richard Baxter in the 17th
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.000]   century drifted away from an emphasis on certain man-humbling, God-exalting teachings and how
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   the following generations reaped a grim harvest in the Baxter church in Kitterminster.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.640]   And you can see the same thing in the 19th century in the downgrade controversy surrounding
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.240]   Charles Spurgeon.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.160]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 3.15 that the church of the living God is the pillar and bulwark
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   of the truth.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:59.040]   And what I'm suggesting is that part of that bulwark is the church's stand, embrace,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.480]   love for the profoundly God-centered vision of reality implicit in the all-pervasive providence
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   of God.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.560]   When that is surrendered, the church is vulnerable to many man-centered distortions of biblical
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   truth.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.160]   So what I'm saying is that seeing and savoring this providence sends the roots of countercultural
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.640]   conviction so deeply into the rock of Scripture that lovers of this truth are not easily blown
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.680]   over by the winds of false teaching.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.960]   Why?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.440]   One reason, I think, is that this providence is so contrary to fallen human nature and
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.280]   so out of step with the prevailing self-exalting culture that if Christians can break ranks
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.800]   with the world on this point and hold fast to this truth, then they can on any point,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.240]   which means they are safe from much deception from the world.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   There's another reason I think that embracing God's all-governing providence makes us resistant
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:22.400]   to man-centered substitutes, namely, the sheer enormity of God, the sheer weight and seriousness
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:31.760]   and authority of God implicit in this doctrine creates in the soul a spiritual sense, a kind
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:42.240]   of holy acumen that can detect in any idea or doctrine or behavior a tendency toward
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.000]   exalting man while diminishing God.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   In 1 Corinthians 1, 26-30, Paul tells us to remember and to consider our calling.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.840]   And then he describes this calling in a way that explicitly says God's providence in
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:11.720]   bringing us to himself in this calling was carried out in such a way as to stop the mouth
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.280]   of all man-centered boasting and to awaken only Christ-exalting boasting.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:26.640]   In other words, views that put man low in his own boast and put Christ high in our boast,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.440]   that view will keep us from drifting away from a right understanding of our calling.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.200]   Here's what he says.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.000]   Consider your calling, brothers.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.480]   Not many of you were wise according to the worldly standards.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320]   Not many were powerful.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.080]   Not many were of noble birth.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.200]   But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.360]   God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.880]   God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.160]   to nothing things that are.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.240]   And here it is.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.960]   So that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.920]   And then he flips it and he gives the positive alternative.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:17.960]   Because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.320]   and sanctification, and redemption.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   And here it is.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:28.960]   So that, as it is written, let him who boasts boast in the Lord.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   In other words, God in his providence has saved us and called us in a way so that he
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   secures from us self-humbling and Christ-exalting.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.160]   The self is humbled.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.880]   Christ is exalted.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:58.260]   And I believe that the reality of God's all-pervading, all-embracing providence does that.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:06.280]   And in that way is part of the bulwark of the truth that protects us from many false
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   ideas.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.560]   And that is a great and precious gift.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.960]   Immunized against false, man-centered theology by the precious doctrine of the providence
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.360]   of God.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.040]   That is implication number seven of ten in our Wednesday series.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   So good.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   Love this series.

[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.840]   Should I pursue my dream or should I pursue obedience?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.360]   Question a lot of Christians face when thinking about career options or career changes.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.240]   Do we follow our heart or do we choose what is most obedient?
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.800]   It's a great question about career choices.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.480]   It comes in from a listener to the podcast named Josh.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.040]   And Pastor John will weigh in to close out the week.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   Thanks for listening.
