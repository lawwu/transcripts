[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   A podcast listener named Chris writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, my wife and I
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.360]   adopted our youngest son from Ethiopia just over a year ago.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.680]   What a gift he's been to us.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.400]   He's a toddler now and beautiful differences in our skin color and hair type will stand
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.240]   out to him soon, if not already.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   The question we wrestle with is how soon do we start the discussion of his adoption with
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.720]   him?"
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   Great question.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.480]   I'm glad it was asked and I pulled Noel and Talitha together last night to ask them this
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   question.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.480]   My wife and daughter, Talitha's adopted.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.740]   She's 18 now.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.320]   She remembers a lot of how we did this and so we asked her how she felt about it.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.520]   And so what I'm about to say is coming with both of their input, not just me.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.800]   In fact, Talitha said that the things she appreciated and values and remembers might
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   not always work with all her friends that she knows who are adopted.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.400]   So I don't want anybody to say we've got the last word here.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   Every family is the same.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   It's not.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.400]   Our conviction is that from the very beginning, I mean, as soon as this kid can hear you talk,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.800]   adoption should be a reality spoken of the way birth and eating and playing and sleeping
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.720]   and all other ordinary realities of life are talked about.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.000]   So you just talk about it.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.160]   There's adoption.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440]   So your two year old hears you talking about children being adopted and children being
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   born.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.880]   And he doesn't know what either of those mean.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.280]   He doesn't know the word adopted.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280]   He doesn't know the word born yet.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.960]   He's just hearing you talk about it.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.000]   But little by little, understanding dawns.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   And with every new perceived growth in understanding, mom and dad fill in more and more of the missing
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   pieces.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   In other words, you are never hiding from this kid that he's adopted and you're never
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.240]   hiding the concept of adoption and they grow organically together.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.280]   Get good children's picture books.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.240]   I'm talking about a picture book that a kid eats.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   You know, the board kind that they don't know what they know what you're doing.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.240]   They just chew it.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.400]   Well, get those.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   And when they're six months old, nine months old, 18 months old, whatever will work.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   Set those books in front of them with kids of different color.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.680]   And these books are about adoption or non adoption.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.320]   They're about the whole range of kids going up together and transracial adoptions.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.120]   There are a lot of good books out there for this.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.720]   Find them and make sure you're just reading about it and talking about it.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.600]   Right apart from applying it to your own kid.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   This is reality.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.520]   So the books grow with the child and the board books at the beginning that they chew on and
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.000]   then more sophisticated books.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.080]   And very soon this kid's going to have some questions and then you're just going to answer
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   those questions.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.200]   Talitha remembers from very early a book about hair.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.560]   It was just about hair and the African-American experience of hair.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.680]   And she didn't have any self-conscious at the time being African-American at all.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.800]   But she says she can remember this.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.560]   So she was probably what three maybe.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   I don't know.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.800]   I have a little different kinds of hair, which which was helpful.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.620]   You don't wait until a magic moment to say you were adopted.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.120]   This is spoken from the beginning.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.360]   Like like you have five toes and you have eyes and some kids have brown eyes and some
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   have blue eyes.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   You have brown eyes.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   Some kids are adopted.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   Some kids come another way.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.320]   You came by adoption.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.920]   And they don't they won't even they'll be so confused.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   But they're happy.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.480]   You know they're happy.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.720]   You're talking about things and I'll know what you're talking about someday.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.220]   Now here's an event.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.080]   Here's an illustration.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.960]   Talitha was what I don't know how old she was two or three.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.480]   But anyway we were at a pro-life march.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   OK.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.040]   Every year we march in with several thousand people.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.000]   And they've got these big pictures of these babies.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.440]   And of course some of them are horrible pictures.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.680]   And you probably shield your little one from from that.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.600]   But beautiful pictures of babies.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.240]   And she said to Noel, "Baby, baby was born.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   Baby was born."
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   Or something like that.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.000]   And Talitha said, "Yes.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.620]   And you were born."
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320]   And Talitha said, "No.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520]   I wasn't born.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.640]   I was adopted."
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.160]   So up until that time she was hearing the language.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.040]   And some are born and some are adopted.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.760]   And that's the way she had put it together.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'm the adopted kind.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.600]   And so over the next half hour by the time that was done she, Noel, had made a little
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.280]   progress in sorting out.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   No, no.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.520]   Adopted kids are also born kids.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.240]   And now that of course is going to raise a whole slew of questions of did I come from
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.060]   you or somebody else?
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.360]   But you know kids ask questions very early before they're ready for answers.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.240]   And the Lord gives you wisdom to know the kind of helpful thing to say that gives them
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.320]   just enough of what they need to run off and be happy with their friends before you give
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.520]   them a big lecture that they weren't even intending to ask about.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.600]   Of course you need answers ready when the hard questions come.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.560]   Why did my mommy give me away?
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.920]   You need an answer for that.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.840]   Who is my daddy?
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.120]   Why didn't he stay around?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.720]   Why don't we know who he is?
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.320]   Did he not care about me?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   Those are the questions for which there are Christian answers.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.360]   And mainly you try to discern at those moments where the child is and what they really want
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   to know.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   And you massively affirm that you have chosen them.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.480]   You care for them.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.320]   You are mommy and daddy.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.200]   They are loved by you.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.580]   And then you provide them whatever you can about the hardship that mom and dad were going
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.560]   through that made it very hard for them to love you the way they wanted to and you know
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.040]   something like that.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.660]   So the principle is adoption is normal and wonderful and a perfectly natural process
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.660]   of life.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.240]   Speak of it that way from the very beginning.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.600]   God adopted us.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.200]   Lots of kids and children are adopted.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.840]   There are a lot of adopted families.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   We chose you.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.340]   We wanted you.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.200]   You are very precious to us.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.000]   You are here and I am your daddy and I will always be here for you.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You're safe.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.280]   Thank you for your example, Pastor John.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.320]   And thank you, Noel and Talitha for your input in this episode.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.440]   I'm sure it's going to help a lot of people.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   So thank you for that.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.240]   This is the third and final part of a little series of episodes on adoption.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.920]   Be sure to check out the two previous episodes, number 349 and 350 for more if you haven't
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   heard those.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.800]   Well, adoption is a joy to talk about and it's so wonderful to see happen.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.480]   But there are subjects on this podcast that we address that are neither joyful to talk
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.060]   about nor wonderful to see happen.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.920]   And that will be the case tomorrow when we address the subject of suicide and salvation.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   It's a question that has hit home for Pastor John over the years.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.880]   It's a very personal question for him.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.840]   And we'll talk about that with him tomorrow.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.360]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.860]   [END]
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   1.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.860]   Is there a reason why people don't talk about suicide?
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.860]   2.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.860]   Is there a reason why people don't talk about suicide?
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860]   3.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.860]   Is there a reason why people don't talk about suicide?
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860]   4.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.860]   Is there a reason why people don't talk about suicide?
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.860]   5.
