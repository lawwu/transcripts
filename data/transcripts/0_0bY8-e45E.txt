[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   - From the Ask Pastor John podcast inbox,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.200]   hello, my name is Lydia.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.320]   I listen to you daily from Argentina.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   I really wanted to thank you for your podcast.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.780]   I enjoy it and learn a lot with every episode.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960]   My question for Pastor John is this,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.080]   what are your thoughts about the rapture of the church
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.400]   and what we should do to prepare for it?
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.080]   - I wrote a piece about this a long time ago
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.360]   with a lot of definitions and arguments
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960]   that you could check out at Desiring God website.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   But so let me be brief here.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.120]   The rapture refers to the rising of the church
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.520]   to meet the Lord Jesus in the air at his second coming.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   So here's a description of it in 1 Thessalonians 4.16.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.680]   The Lord himself will descend from heaven.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.480]   This is the second coming.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.900]   Will descend from heaven with a shout,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.860]   with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.800]   and the dead in Christ.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200]   So all your dead friends who are believers
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.200]   will rise first and then we who are alive and remain
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.840]   shall be caught up together with them in the clouds
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.240]   to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.640]   And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.320]   That's what is referred to as the rapture,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.400]   the old word rapture to be snatched up
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.880]   or snatched up into the clouds.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.320]   So my first thought about the rapture
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   is that it is true and wonderful and encouraging.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.440]   In fact, Paul concludes that paragraph
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.520]   in 1 Thessalonians 4 with these words, verse 18.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.000]   Therefore, encourage one another with these words.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.200]   Encourage one another with these words.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.440]   He's coming.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.900]   You can be caught up to meet him.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.280]   Both the dead and the living.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.760]   You won't miss out if you've died
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.320]   and you won't miss out if you're alive.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.880]   You'll be caught up and meet him in the air.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   Just like he ascended on the clouds,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.800]   you will rise to meet him in the clouds.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.060]   He's coming and whether we are alive or dead,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560]   we will live and rise and meet him and so be encouraged.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640]   We're gonna be a great assembly of worshipers.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.200]   In fact, according to 2 Thessalonians,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.260]   we're gonna marvel and exult in his glory at that moment.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.920]   It says in 2 Thessalonians 1 10,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.620]   and to be marveled at among all who have believed.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.480]   Human beings were made to marvel.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.280]   And never have we marveled in this life
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.460]   like we will marvel on that day.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.340]   This will be the great climax of all our Christian hedonism.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.140]   We will experience our greatest joy in marveling
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.020]   the way we were finally made to marvel.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.100]   And Christ will be magnified in our marveling
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.060]   as never before.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.060]   It will be a glorious consummation of history.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.460]   Now, the question that conservative evangelicals
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.140]   have raised over the years is does this event
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   of rising to meet the Lord in the air,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.140]   does it happen after or before this season
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.520]   of great tribulation at the end of the age
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.080]   that Jesus refers to in Matthew 24 21
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.500]   and Revelation refers to in Revelation 7 14?
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.800]   Do we rise to meet him and get taken away
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.940]   from the earth for seven years of tribulation,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.620]   which we skip, waiting in heaven,
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.820]   or do we go through the tribulation
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.860]   and exult in his coming at the end of history
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.520]   to destroy all his enemies?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.580]   And my understanding of the New Testament
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.360]   is the second alternative.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.180]   It's called post-tribulation because it comes after.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.780]   The second coming and our rising to meet the Lord
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.220]   in the air come after that terrible season
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.980]   of suffering at the end of history.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.700]   And I've given nine reasons in that article
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.560]   I referred to at Desiring God.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440]   Let me just give you one as we wrap this up.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.500]   The wording of 2 Thessalonians 1 5-9 is the key.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.460]   Here's what it says.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.440]   Your suffering, so the Thessalonians had been suffering,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.300]   is evidence of the righteous judgment of God
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.260]   that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.120]   for which you are also suffering,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.440]   since indeed God considers it just
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.260]   to repay with affliction those who afflict you
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.660]   and to grant relief to you when you are afflicted
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.740]   as well as to us when the Lord Jesus is revealed
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.720]   from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.780]   inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.240]   and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.700]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.260]   away from the presence of the Lord
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.620]   and from the glory of his might.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.660]   So here's my conclusion from those verses.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.540]   It seems clear to me that Paul expects believers on earth
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.660]   to get rest from their suffering at the same time
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.060]   and in the same event that their enemies get punishment,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.500]   namely at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.240]   Somebody can read that part again.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.560]   God considers it just to repay with affliction
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.620]   those who afflict you, that's one,
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.620]   and grant relief to you who are afflicted, that's two.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.220]   And when do both those things happen?
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.760]   When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.260]   with his mighty angels in flaming fire.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.220]   And that revelation of his mighty angels in flaming fire
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.000]   is not the snatching of the Christians out of the world
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   and taking them away for seven years
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.400]   and coming back seven years later
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.560]   to do that kind of punishing work at his second coming.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   So I think there's only one second coming,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.920]   not two stages, but one,
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.800]   and it happens after the church goes through
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.360]   that period of suffering and affliction
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   at the end of the age.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   So my answer to the question of how to prepare
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.520]   is pray for the Lord to come.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.680]   This is what we long for.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   This is our great and blessed hope.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.880]   We want the Lord Jesus to come, let's pray.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.600]   Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.720]   And the way to get ready for it
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.620]   is to trust the promises of God,
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.320]   to turn all our sufferings,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.720]   we're not promised to escape suffering,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   to turn all our sufferings for our good
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.100]   and then be about the will of God
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.560]   so that when he comes,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   he will find you faithful at your appointed task.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.440]   Yes, amen, come Lord Jesus.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.420]   Thank you, Pastor John,
