[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   I just think there's many many issues that are enormously important but are just not incentivized
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.360]   basically anywhere in the world where companies don't incentivize work on them because they're
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.600]   like too big picture. So some of these are like yeah is the future good rather than bad? If there
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.760]   was a global civilizational collapse would we recover? You know how likely is a century's long
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.360]   stagnation? There's almost no work done on any of these topics and yeah companies aren't interested
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.280]   too grand in scale. And then academia I think has just developed a culture where you don't tackle
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   such problems in academia. Partly that's because they fall through cracks of different disciplines
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.680]   and partly because they just seem too big or too grand or too speculative. I'm not saying that like
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.200]   all of academic inquiry should be like that but should there be at least some people whose role
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.120]   to really think about the big picture, and I think yes.
