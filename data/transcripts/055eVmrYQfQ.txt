[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Today we have a question from someone who is drained, a listener who is exhausted.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.080]   So how do we recharge without neglecting our souls?
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   Here's the question.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.920]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm 41 years old and have been a pastor for 9 years, leading a small
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.480]   but growing church of 120 people in Wales.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.920]   As I have served as a pastor and a leader over this time, I've found that due to the
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.760]   spiritually, emotionally, and mentally draining nature of the work, whenever I have spare
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.440]   time (an evening off or a Saturday free) all I want to do is switch off and do trivial
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.920]   stuff like watch sports.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.600]   I feel like I should be doing more personal reading or devotional God-pursuing stuff,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   but I can't find the energy or the desire.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.680]   Ministry is hard work, so when I have opportunity I want to escape from things connected to
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   it.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920]   How do you handle this tension between ministry as part of your work that you give your time
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   and attention to for much of the day, and then the need to have energy to pursue God
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   personally outside of your formal ministry activities?
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   Have you felt this tension, and do you have any advice for a young and already tired pastor?"
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560]   Yes, I have felt that tension.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000]   I doubt that you or I will ever escape it.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.360]   As I've tried to examine and study my own heart in regard to its inclinations when I'm
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.360]   tired, I am fairly suspicious of how self-justifying I can be in the defense of my inclination
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.160]   to compromise my mind and my conscience and what I do with my so-called "downtime."
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   I say that just to wave a yellow flag, lest we assume that weariness after the Lord's
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   work can justify almost anything.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.640]   I think such subtle self-justifications of worldliness are the beginnings of many pastoral
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.020]   downfalls.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:10.120]   You might say worldly downtimes lead to wicked downfalls.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.000]   So here are a few things I have found and would suggest.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.240]   I would begin by making it my daily prayer that God would keep me back from ministry
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:33.120]   ruining, marriage ruining, soul ruining sin in my leisure.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.800]   Jesus did not teach us to pray, "Lead us not into temptation," for nothing.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.960]   God keeps—he keeps—the hearts and marriages and ministries of those who cry out daily
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.400]   to be kept.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:01.040]   Second, I would say put your own personal Bible reading and meditation and memory work
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:11.640]   and your own soul feeding with Bible-saturated literature—put that first in the day, not
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.560]   at the end of the day when you're tired.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.500]   Take your best times of the day with your best energy and feed your soul.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.880]   Keep the Lord over his Word with your best energy, not the dregs at the end of the day.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.520]   Any pastor who says, "I work so hard at the demands of the church ministry that I
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.600]   don't have energy for feeding my own soul through Scripture and Scripture-saturated
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.440]   books," has got his day backward.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.960]   If there are parts of the day with much energy and parts with little energy, then let the
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.280]   one of the parts with much energy be given to what is absolutely indispensable—communion
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.580]   with God in his Word for the sake of seeing and savoring the King of heaven.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:23.220]   Because if this personal joy, personal fellowship, personal hope languishes, everything languishes,
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.060]   and worse than languishes usually.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.560]   What our people need from us more than anything is the aroma of Christ.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.220]   The world is filled with managerial experts in ministry.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.980]   They create seasons of excitement in the life of the church, but they are shallow.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.220]   And sooner or later, the human soul grows weary of such technical expertise.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.020]   You have to keep propping it up with more smoke and mirrors and sound and light and
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020]   everything external.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.180]   You have to keep propping it up.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.340]   It's so superficial.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.940]   And the soul longs for a deep man of God.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.340]   This is what people long for, a deep man of God.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.820]   Have you been with God?
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.480]   Come show me that you've been with God, a man of the Word, a man of substance who has
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.500]   gone deep with eternal things and come up out of the valley laden with nourishing fruit
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.260]   for his people.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:42.000]   This is only possible if we give the first priority to knowing God, not working for God.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.420]   So that's my second suggestion.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.900]   Reverse the order of your days.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.140]   Give your best energy to going deep with God.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.020]   Your people will not begrudge being in second place.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.980]   Oh, they will love it.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.420]   And the third thing I would say is this.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:13.060]   In the evening, when your work is done or on your day off, it is no sin to leave your
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:21.200]   Bible on the table, provided you leave your Bible for the sake of your Bible.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.860]   The Bible itself calls us to do many things besides read the Bible.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.700]   Therefore, to obey the Bible, we have to leave the Bible on the desk.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.180]   Now here's the challenge.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:45.620]   If we leave the Bible for the sake of the Bible, we must do things that don't undermine
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.540]   our capacities to revel in what we find in the Bible.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.540]   Let me say that again.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:01.340]   When we leave the Bible for the sake of the Bible, we must not do things that have effects
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.460]   on our heart and mind, which unfit us for deeper, sweeter reveling in the glories of
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300]   what we find in the Bible.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.960]   We must be absolutely honest with our hearts here.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   Come on, pastors.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.740]   We must be honest with our hearts here.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:27.180]   Does this video, does this TV show, which everybody's watching—of course they are—does
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:38.180]   this video game leave us refined and intensified in our capacities to revel in the unsearchable
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.140]   riches of Christ in the Scriptures?
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:49.340]   I fear that for many pastors, the answer would be no, and he just doesn't care.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.260]   He's tired.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:59.980]   I believe we live in a day where immersion in popular culture, with all of its God-ignoring,
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:08.380]   sin-enjoying, pride-exalting assumptions, is not only assumed to be harmless, but assumed
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.540]   to be necessary.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.040]   Both of those assumptions are wrong, deadly wrong.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.100]   So let me see if I can give a few pointers for the kinds of things a pastor, or for that
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   matter, anybody, might do when they feel mentally spent.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:41.220]   Number one, when the mind feels too weary to read, it is probably not too weary to listen.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:49.820]   Therefore, audiobooks are an amazing way to feed the mind when the mind is too tired to
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.560]   pick up the spoon to feed itself.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:02.220]   And this feeding can be enormously enjoyable and refreshing and informative and upbuilding.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.300]   All of us know that there are great books, both fiction and nonfiction, that are a hundred
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:14.540]   times superior to what's on TV or the trending movies, which we have always wanted to read
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.420]   anyway.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:26.180]   Listening to a great book may not provide the same exactness as reading it, but we're
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.580]   not comparing listening to reading.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.420]   We're comparing listening to a great book, on the one hand, to groveling in the world's
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.780]   sensual entertainment, on the other hand.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.660]   So that's number one.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.940]   Consider audiobooks that are great and edifying.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.860]   Number two, if you're married, think about things you can do with your spouse.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.820]   There are games, like Scrabble, that you can play together that require different levels
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.260]   of mental energy.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:10.820]   Scrabble may not be your cup of tea, but they provide a peaceful, pleasant, relaxing way
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.580]   to be in the same room and provide natural occasion for conversation from time to time.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.860]   And the last thing I would say is go to Spurgeon and get this.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.540]   I love this.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:32.460]   Don't neglect the soul-refreshing world outside your house that God has given you precisely
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.140]   to touch your soul with new vision, new energy, refreshment.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.100]   I'm talking about the sky and the trees and streams and the fields and birds and the animals,
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.780]   even the beautiful cityscapes like I have outside my house, as well as landscapes, which
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.380]   you have to drive away to see.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:11:00.940]   The soul needs God's beauty taken in directly from nature.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.900]   And here's the way Spurgeon put it.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.900]   He who forgets the humming of the bees among the heather, the cooing of the wood pigeons
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:16.500]   in the forest, the song of birds in the woods, the rippling of rills among the rushes, and
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.940]   the sighing of the wind among the pines, needs not wonder if his heart forgets to sing and
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.860]   his soul grows heavy.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:34.740]   A day's breathing of fresh air upon the hills or a few hours ramble in the beechwoods calm
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.420]   would sweep the cobwebs out of the brain of scores of toiling ministers who are now but
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.500]   half alive.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:50.100]   A mouthful of sea air or a stiff walk in the wind's face would not give grace to the soul,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.500]   but it would yield oxygen to the body, which is the next best thing.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:02.140]   For lack of opportunity or inclination, these great remedies are neglected, and the student
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.620]   becomes a self-immolated victim.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.740]   So let me summarize.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.620]   First, ask God to protect you from wasted leisure.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.820]   Second, reverse the order of your days and give your best energies to feeding your soul
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.700]   on the sweetness of Christ.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:27.900]   Third, leave your Bible for the sake of your Bible, and that means when you leave, don't
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.340]   do anything that would diminish your capacities to revel in the riches of the Bible.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.340]   So good.
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.340]   So good.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.540]   Man, how I wish everyone could see this soul-refreshing cityscape that you and Noel enjoy outside
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.820]   the front of your house.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.980]   On days like this, it is simply astonishing.
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.540]   The difference between looking at Los Angeles through the smog and looking at what I look
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.140]   at on a crisp day like this is the difference between being half blind and seeing.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.380]   It really is an amazing view.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.220]   Thank you, Pastor Jen, for thinking through this question, for sharing your thoughts on
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.500]   how we can recharge ourselves without neglecting our souls.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.580]   We love hearing from leaders and questions that you face and the perplexities and challenges
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580]   of leadership.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.220]   Please send those into us.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.980]   You can do that by emailing us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.340]   On Friday, we're going to close out the week with a common question about complementarity,
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.640]   especially the question about whether in our stress to say that men and women work together
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.420]   in different ways that are dissimilar in order to complement one another, it leads to the
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.780]   question over whether that means that men are more competent than women and are women
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.980]   less valuable than men.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.660]   We've got to keep asking these questions and we will on Friday.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.900]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.020]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and Pastor John
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.020]   Piper.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.660]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.160]   [END]
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime author and Pastor John Piper.
