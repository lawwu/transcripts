[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640]   Well, is a Christian life a life of peace or is the Christian life a life of warfare?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   It's a great question with a stunningly simple answer and it came in the form of a 2005 regional
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.720]   conference message from John Piper in Greenville, South Carolina.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.720]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.880]   "The Lord Jesus on the Damascus road says to Paul, 'I send you, I send you to open their
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.280]   eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God that they
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.600]   may receive forgiveness of sins.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.480]   I send you to open their eyes.'"
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.720]   Right, right.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   Paul knew good and well God alone opens eyes.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.840]   Second Timothy 4, 6, "The God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shown into
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   Paul knew that.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.240]   He wrote that.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.640]   He knew that God alone can raise the dead.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.400]   God alone can give hearing to the ear.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.680]   God alone can give light, spiritual light to the blind eye and he makes humans an essential
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   element, means in the process called evangelism.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.360]   Or he makes you a key player in your fight for joy.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.060]   It's his gift.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.600]   He alone can give it and you must fight for it.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.300]   Now that produces a certain modesty, I think, in the fight.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.760]   When I say you must fight and only God can give, it should create a certain modesty in
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   the fight.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.640]   I use that phrase because it seems the best alternative to the presumption that comes
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.960]   with thinking, "I can make this happen.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   I can make this happen.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   He tells me to rejoice in the Lord and always rejoice.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   All right, if he tells me to do it, I'll do it."
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.440]   There's a certain presumption there that just doesn't fit with everything I've seen so far.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   Here's some texts that describe the modesty of the Christian claim on God.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.400]   Proverbs 21, 31, "The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory belongs
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   to the Lord."
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.440]   It's a certain modesty as you go into battle.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.720]   I will make my horse ready.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.640]   I will strap it tight.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.240]   I will put my sword in my hand.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   I will get a good night's rest.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   I will eat breakfast properly.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.960]   I will stoke the engines of my flame for God, but victory is in the hands of the Lord.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.800]   Joy belongs to the Lord.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.320]   Or Proverbs 19, 21, "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but the purpose of the
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   Lord will stand."
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360]   Be a planning people.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.640]   Be planning churches.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.840]   Oh, yes, don't live planless lives.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.040]   Just be modest.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.520]   Your plans may or may not happen, and God will decide.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.880]   And be happy about that.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.940]   Be totally happy about that.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.340]   Or Psalm 127, 1, "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.960]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain."
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.840]   Be a watchman and build a house, but just be modest.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.800]   If your house gets built, God built it.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.960]   And if nobody attacks the city, God kept them from attacking the city.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:58.720]   We have a place in causality, whether it's our joy, guiding ourselves, growing a church,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.160]   leading someone to Christ.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.880]   We have an indispensable place on planet Earth.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.440]   He wouldn't have created us if there were no reason for us to be.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.120]   But it is a modest place that ascribes to God the final say in whether I'm happy today
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.800]   or not.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:27.100]   We must not begrudge to God the seasons of winter that he may will for us when we have
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.960]   done all we can do to make ourselves as happy as we should be, and we're not.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   There are several things that this modesty accomplishes.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.560]   One, it guards me from thinking that I decisively produce the joy that God demands, and therefore
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.200]   life becomes a series of techniques.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.460]   I think one of the reasons in America that we are a technique people, I mean, just open
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.340]   magazine after magazine, mail after mail, here's the new technique for your marriage
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.800]   and the new technique for living the victorious Christian life and the new technique for growing
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.060]   the church and technique, technique, technique.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.660]   The reason we are technilogical people, whatever that word is, is because we're not modest.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.980]   We don't really emotionally embrace the fact that God has given us some things to do, but
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.220]   in the end, we don't have control.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.140]   God has control.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.500]   That removes the, "I'm an American.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   I got to have results, so I will get people saved.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.300]   And the way to get them saved, if I can't make them saved, is I'll develop a technique
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.380]   that gets them saved on the beach immediately."
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.820]   And that's where a lot of our evangelistic strategies have come from, a lack of submission
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.780]   to God's sovereignty, a lack of modesty, and therefore the drive to produce managerial
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.700]   techniques that make things happen ourselves.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.140]   That's one thing this view will help you avoid.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:10.580]   The second thing is that it will keep you from falling into legalism, thinking that
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.580]   you can do this in order to earn God's favor.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.540]   You got to have God's favor first before you can do this.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.500]   We'll get there in a minute.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.340]   The third thing it does is help balance.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.620]   I don't know if you've ever struggled with this like I and people in my church do, the
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.820]   balance between life as fight and life as rest.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.940]   Matthew 7, 14, "The gate is narrow, the way is hard that leads to life, and those who
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.940]   find it are few."
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.860]   So the Christian life is hard, right?
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.860]   It's hard.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860]   It's a fight.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.860]   It's war.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.860]   That's one thing.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.420]   And if that's the only way you think, you're probably going to be a sick person because
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.620]   you also know another thing Jesus said in Matthew.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.060]   That's Matthew 7.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.060]   Always keep Matthew 11 and 7 together.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.060]   Seven, 11.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.260]   You're going to remember it that way.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.540]   What did he say in chapter 11?
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.900]   "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you," say it, "rest
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.460]   and take my yoke upon you and learn from me.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.540]   For I'm meek and lowly in heart and you'll find rest for your soul."
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.900]   Well, Jesus, which is it?
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   Rest or hard?
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.900]   Narrow?
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:32.540]   Am I in your arms just kind of being brought to heaven or am I swimming and stumbling and
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.900]   working and climbing and clawing?
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.220]   Is it restful to be a Christian or is it war to be a Christian?
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.000]   And the answer is it's both.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.300]   And here's the way they come together.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.620]   The war is to rest in the right place.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.380]   And the whole world is telling you to rest in all the wrong places.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.680]   Rest in money.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.780]   Rest in success.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.100]   Rest in your looks.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.780]   Rest in your strength.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.900]   Rest in your business.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:09.380]   The world wants you to find your satisfaction, your restfulness, your peacefulness in insurance,
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:16.180]   padlocks, cruises, big fat retirement, big portfolio.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.160]   These are all the restfulness commendations of the world.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.780]   And the war is to rest in the right place.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:31.620]   And it just happens to be hard to rest for Christians who are worldly.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:40.220]   And another reason that I stress this modesty is that it does give all glory to God.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.420]   That is so good, important, and culturally revolutionary.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.460]   That was John Piper from his 2005 regional conference message titled "When I Don't Desire
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.160]   God, Part 3" preached in Greenville, South Carolina.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.260]   This golden clip was found and sent in to us by Paul DiVincenzo.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.340]   Thank you, Paul, for the clip.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.580]   You can find the full message, of course, at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.500]   On Wednesdays, we dip into the sermon archives and play your favorite clips.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.300]   If you have a clip that you love and you want to share with us, email me the name of the
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.480]   sermon and a timestamp of when and where the clip occurs in the audio.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.380]   If we post your clip, we'll give you credit, of course.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.380]   Send me an email at AspastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:23.580]   Well, as we often do, we address painful questions of life and tomorrow a listener who is drifting
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.580]   away from God.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.260]   He wants John Piper's counsel and his help.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.860]   You won't want to miss this one.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.700]   I'll see you tomorrow on the Aspastor John Podcast.
