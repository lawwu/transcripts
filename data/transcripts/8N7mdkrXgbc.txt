[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.340]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.920]   My guest today is Dr. Kelly Starrett.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.000]   Dr. Kelly Starrett is a doctor of physical therapy
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.840]   and one of the world's experts in movement.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.600]   That is, he teaches people how to move better
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.880]   for sake of sport, for sake of recreational fitness,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.680]   and for everyday living.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.640]   Today, we discuss several important topics,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.520]   including how best to warm up for any and all workouts.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   He also tells us how to improve our movement patterns
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.760]   for cardiovascular exercise, for sport,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.120]   for resistance training,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.720]   across the board, how to move better,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.600]   and how to improve our range of motion
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.040]   with the minimal amount of time investment.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000]   We hear a lot about different forms of stretching.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.440]   We hear about dynamic stretching.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200]   We hear about passive stretching.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   Dr. Starrett explains how to improve our range of motion
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.220]   across our entire body in the best possible ways,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.440]   as well as how to offset or repair any imbalances
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.960]   that stem from musculoskeletal problems
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680]   or from neural issues, and how to reduce soreness,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.440]   how to improve our posture,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.960]   seated, standing, and movement-based posture.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   We talk about nutrition.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.500]   So today's episode covers an immense amount
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.240]   of actionable information
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   that I'm certain all of you will benefit from.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.120]   Dr. Kelly Starrett has authored several best-selling books,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.360]   some of which you may have heard of,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.840]   such as "Supple Leopard."
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.400]   He was actually one of the first people to become synonymous
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.120]   with the use of a lacrosse ball or foam roller.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.500]   But really, even though a lot of people
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.940]   have talked about those,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.240]   what he was really doing there
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   was to emphasize the importance
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.400]   of understanding the relationship between the skeleton,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.600]   the muscles, the nervous system, and the fascia.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420]   And today we also talk about fascia,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.100]   which is an incredibly interesting and important topic.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.720]   In addition to consulting and coaching
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.200]   for various college-level
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.760]   and professional athletes and teams,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   Dr. Kelly Starrett and his wife, Juliette Starrett,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.360]   co-own "The Ready State."
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   And we provide a link to "The Ready State"
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.800]   in the show note captions there.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   They have a plethora of useful information
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.240]   and actionable protocols.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.780]   I should mention years ago,
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.620]   I took one of the courses from "The Ready State."
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.780]   It's a really interesting course
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.960]   that we touch on some of the protocols from today.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.560]   It's all about pelvic floor.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.940]   So whether you're male or female,
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.000]   and regardless of age,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   understanding your pelvic floor,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   how to take care of your pelvic floor
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   in the context of exercise, posture, et cetera,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.600]   is vitally important
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   for all sorts of vitally important bodily functions.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.720]   So today we also touch on that.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.440]   I'm certain that you will be armed
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.600]   with a number of new highly actionable protocols.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   I should emphasize these protocols take very little time
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.040]   and have an outsized positive effect
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.800]   on your movement, your posture, and your overall health.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.720]   Before we begin,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.780]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.680]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.140]   to the general public.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.240]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.200]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.480]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.900]   Maui Nui Venison is 100% wild harvested venison
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.160]   from the island of Maui,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.800]   and it is the most nutrient dense
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.920]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.560]   I've spoken before on this podcast
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   about the fact that most of us should be consuming
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.640]   about one gram of quality protein
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.920]   per pound of body weight every day.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   That protein provides critical building blocks
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.520]   for things like muscle repair and synthesis,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.440]   but it also promotes overall health
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.080]   given the importance of muscle tissue as an organ.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.920]   Eating enough quality protein each day
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.400]   is also a terrific way to stave off hunger.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.660]   One of the key things, however,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.960]   is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.200]   without ingesting excess calories.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.120]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.720]   per calorie ratio,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   so that getting one gram of quality protein
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.760]   per pound of body weight is both easy
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.880]   Also, Maui Nui Venison is absolutely delicious.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.240]   They have venison steaks,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.260]   ground venison, and venison bone broth.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.120]   I personally like all of those.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.440]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui Venison burger
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.680]   pretty much every day,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.360]   and occasionally I'll swap that for a Maui Nui steak.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.040]   Responsible population management
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.280]   of the axis deer on the island of Maui
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.440]   means they cannot go beyond a particular harvest capacity.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.000]   Signing up for a membership is therefore the best way
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.800]   to ensure access to their high quality meat.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.760]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.360]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.140]   to get 20% off your membership or first order.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.920]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.160]   Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.280]   on this podcast,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.600]   it's the incredible impact that light can have
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   on our biology.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.280]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.920]   red light and near infrared light
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.680]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.640]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.360]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.420]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.200]   improvements in acne, meaning reductions in acne,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.600]   reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.960]   improved mitochondrial function,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.580]   and even improving visual function itself.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.920]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.120]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.340]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.640]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.120]   and near infrared light in specific combinations
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.680]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.320]   about three to four times per week,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.720]   typically in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600]   And I use the Juve handheld light
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.620]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.760]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.040]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.960]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.360]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   Again, that's juve, J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.340]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.440]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Kelly Starrett.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.640]   Dr. Kelly Starrett, welcome.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.080]   - Thank you, my friend.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.240]   - I've been wanting to get you on here for a long time
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.480]   for many reasons, not the least of which is that
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.200]   you've just pioneered so many areas of health and fitness
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.520]   that I don't even know where to start, frankly.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.920]   But let's jump in with the big M, with movement.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.120]   You're an expert in dissecting complex movement,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600]   figuring out how people can move better,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.880]   and also figuring out how people who are doing
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.840]   what they think are simple movements
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.060]   are actually making their life either more complex
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.320]   or more painful than it needs to be.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   So you're also known for helping people
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.380]   with so-called mobility,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.980]   which of course falls under the umbrella of movement.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.480]   And I can't see somebody do a foam roll
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.560]   or anything with a lacrosse ball
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   where they're loosening up or talking about fascia
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.720]   without also thinking about you.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.920]   So that should frame today's conversation
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.020]   at least partially well.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.860]   To kick things off, when you look at how most people sit,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.920]   walk, and do their "exercise," resistance training
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.480]   and/or cardiovascular, hopefully,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.600]   and cardiovascular training,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   what are some of the most common problems that you see?
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.720]   Is it imbalance, like leaning to one side?
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.240]   Is it that their bodies are trained into asymmetry?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.560]   Is there any way to kind of, you know,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.660]   mass-diagnose everybody all at once in this first question?
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.480]   - Let me borrow a couple analogies
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.920]   from one of my favorite people, Katie Bowman.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   And first thing is she will point out,
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.360]   and it's not a perfect analogy, so bear with us,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.160]   is this notion of mechanotransduction,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.040]   which means that at a cellular level,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.400]   your tissues, some of your tissues specifically,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.160]   need mechanical input to express themselves.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.000]   You want a strong tendon?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.040]   How do you get a strong tendon?
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.680]   You have to load it, right?
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.800]   Does it do tendon things?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.000]   Is it lengthening under load?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.720]   Does it shorten under load?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.440]   Does it do isometric holds?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.320]   So we can start at that level.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.800]   She points out that if you put a,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.120]   and again, not a perfect analogy,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.200]   but if you put an orca into captivity,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.160]   over a while, that orca fin will start to fold over.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   Folded fin syndrome, it's nicer than floppy fin syndrome.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.080]   It's hurtful.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.360]   And what you're doing is when you alter the environment
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.920]   that this amazing animal lives in,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.600]   it's not swimming, it's not fighting, it's not hunting,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.880]   you're not loading the base of that fin.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.360]   And so what happens is that collagen breaks down,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   and we start to see changes in that,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.280]   in that expression of that.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.320]   So what we can start to say is, again,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.680]   not romanticizing the Pleistocene era
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.160]   when human beings were paleo,
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   but what is it that we need in our daily dose lives
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.600]   to maintain the integrity of our tissue systems?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.800]   Exposure, so that our brain says, "This is safe."
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.760]   So that you actually have tendons and ligaments
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.680]   that can do what tendons and ligaments can do,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.400]   and fascia that is, can be springy.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.920]   If, borrow another sort of Katie Bowman-ism,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.960]   if we have a movement language,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.000]   an actual language made up of words,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.200]   how many words are you using today?
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.640]   And most of us aren't using that many words,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.480]   so very few words.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.400]   So I sit, I stand, I walk very slowly.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.480]   I sit, I stand, I walk very slowly.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.240]   So everything is just in those few,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.360]   and then I go exercise using the same words.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.040]   I'm on the exercise bike, right?
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.160]   I'm on an elliptical,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.880]   which doesn't actually ask me to have any hip extension.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.480]   And suddenly you can see that our movement language,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.240]   which we're really codifying under intensity, load, right?
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   We're becoming very competent
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   in these adaptation positions, sitting.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.640]   What ends up happening?
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.720]   Well, we start to see that our bodies
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.360]   are adaptation machines, and they just begin to adapt.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.120]   And so suddenly what we have is a human body
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.360]   that doesn't express normative range.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.800]   The brain may not think that that range is even safe
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.080]   and put there.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.040]   Then we start to sort of minimize the movement choices
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.640]   that the brain has, the movement options
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.840]   that the brain has.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.520]   So really the question is,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.680]   you know, at low loads, let's establish things.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.640]   At low loads and low speeds,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   you can get away with everything.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.520]   Why?
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.120]   'Cause this body is rad, and it's designed,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   it's durable, it's not fragile.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.240]   It's designed to be ridden hard
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   and put away wet for a long time.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.480]   Remember when you were 17, would cut off your hand,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.160]   it would grow back the next day, right?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.000]   You would.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   Think about the falls you took skating,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.760]   and you'd be like, "Oh, that sucked."
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.680]   The next day, you put your shoulder back in,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.520]   you just kind of respawn.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.240]   So what is it that we need to put into our movement diet?
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.520]   And then we can start to separate out,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.720]   should that be exercise, or should that be movement?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.160]   And now the real filter that we should be beginning
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   these real and earnest conversations about is,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.480]   what is it in the environment,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.400]   given that I'm a busy working person,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.680]   and maybe I have some agency in the morning,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.240]   and maybe I have some agency in the afternoon,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.200]   but let's take exercise out of it.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   The one hour discreet, working on zone two cardio,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.920]   working on writing my evidence-based practice.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   What should I be doing the rest of the time?
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.360]   So for example, one of the things
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.480]   that we're huge fans of in the evening
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.560]   is sitting on the ground for 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.200]   - In what, cross-legged, squatting?
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.040]   - Yes, long sit, side saddle, 99.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.760]   Anytime you need to fidget, fidget.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.360]   What you'll see is you start to accumulate exposure,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.760]   which I think in my worldview
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.880]   is the first order of magnitude in problem solving
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.320]   is how do we have the human be exposed
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.400]   to the thing we're trying to change or improve
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.680]   or restore normative ranges.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.800]   - So that would be in the evening,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.000]   just getting down on the floor?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.320]   - Yeah, that behavior alone,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.800]   cultures that toilet on the ground, sleep on the ground.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.920]   We start to see fall risk in our elderly populations
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.000]   attenuate to zero, approximate zero.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.960]   Lower hip OA, lower low back OA,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.360]   and it may just be that we're using and touching some shapes
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.560]   and our bodies are saying, hey, let's just keep that around.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.480]   Let's normalize what the hip should be able to do.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.840]   In terms of your connective tissue,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   think about the idea here is that we're loading you
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.080]   passively, actively, whatever,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.680]   that you're saying to your brain,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.560]   this is a quote from one of my PT instructors,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.480]   and this is really important.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160]   If people take this away, they should listen to this.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.760]   Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.640]   At no age, do you stop adapting.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.880]   At no age, do you stop healing.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.840]   Those things slow down.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.680]   It's a little bit harder
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.440]   to have the same adaptation we did.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.600]   We weren't in full-fledged puberty,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.440]   but you can always adapt.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.560]   In the first order of business,
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.880]   if you spend 20 or 30 minutes sitting on the ground,
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.720]   you're gonna start to see
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.280]   that my hamstrings start to feel better.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.560]   My hips start to feel a little better
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.680]   because I'm just spending time in these ranges
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.320]   and my body's gonna start to adapt
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.080]   as I increase my movement language.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.120]   - Would you extend what you just said to,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.920]   I'm like, if somebody has a hardwood floor
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.600]   and maybe a little low pile rug or something like that,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   and they're gonna, I don't know,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.880]   watch a podcast or a movie or a show in the evening,
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   they stretch out and, you know, like on their belly,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.640]   like sort of up dog or cobra or whatever it's called.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   So basically any kind of movement
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.000]   where you're on the ground,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.120]   any kind of squatting,
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.920]   and maybe they start to stretch a bit here and there.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.120]   - Oh, so now we're into the real magic, the behavior.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.680]   Where are we gonna stack these behaviors?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.000]   So if you have to get up and down off the ground,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.840]   plus one, right?
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.320]   I gotta get up and down off the ground every day.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.240]   So if you're an older person
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.760]   who may hasn't gotten off the ground,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.360]   I'm older, I'm just talking about over 50,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.440]   you may not have gotten up and down off the ground
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   for a hundred years.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.520]   You just don't do it anymore, right?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.440]   We wanna hear why I think MMA is so amazing.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.680]   You have to get up and down off the ground a lot, right?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.880]   If you go to Jits, right?
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.920]   How about yoga?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.840]   How about Pilates?
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.560]   You're like, "Wow, there's a lot of time
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.920]   "organizing on the ground."
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.560]   So a lot of people, Ida Rolfe really said,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.720]   "Hey, how do we help the person organizing gravity
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.080]   "first and foremost," right?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.000]   Then we have someone like Phillip Beach,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.400]   who is this incredible,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   he wrote this book on functional embryology,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.320]   which I highly recommend,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   called "Muscles and Meridians," I think,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.680]   "Muscles and Meridians."
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.960]   But his hypothesis is that one of the ways
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.600]   that the body tunes itself is by being on the ground.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.960]   Again, restoring native ranges,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.440]   re-approximating joints, right?
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.640]   Kneeling, walking.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.000]   And if you just took a step back and said,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   "What's it look like for the last 10,000 years?"
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.160]   You know, when have we,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.560]   10,000 years ago, my understanding is that
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.640]   I'm a little fatter, your femur's a little longer,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.960]   but we're pretty much the same people.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.640]   Maybe I don't digest milk yet,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   maybe that's the understanding.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.160]   But ultimately, what behaviors have changed
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.200]   were off the ground.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.720]   And so this is an easy,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.160]   don't need any equipment,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.960]   can drop this in, I can answer my emails, watch TV.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.040]   That seems like how we're going to improve
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.320]   and be able to start to untangle this very complex story,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.440]   not when people have a lot going on.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.040]   - I love this.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.800]   And as you pointed out, sorry,
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.080]   the roller's already there.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.120]   So if you're sitting there and the roller's there,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.000]   another barrier to adherence knocked out.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.920]   So you're like, "Oh, I might as well just,
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.840]   "what's stiff today?
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   "What hurts today?
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.120]   "How could I have some self-soothing input?"
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.000]   And when we're working at high levels of performance,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.280]   like the highest levels,
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.920]   these range of motion,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   like keeping you being able to access
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.960]   the full sort of arsenal of what you can do with your body,
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.200]   these movement solutions,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.360]   sort of like Ido Portal plus the Olympics, right?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.200]   You would see that this is an easy way
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.800]   for our elite athletes to work and integrate
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.840]   without having to do another thing.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.640]   - So what I'm getting here is that everybody,
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.120]   regardless of age,
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.680]   should get down on the ground once a day
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.320]   and get up off the ground at some point, right?
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.480]   - You can use whatever you want
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000]   to help you get up and down off the ground.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.840]   So for those of you who are listening,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.320]   you're like, "I can't do that."
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.400]   You know, there's a test we write about in the book
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.480]   that if you just do criss-cross applesauce standing,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.920]   you should be able to lower yourself to the ground
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.320]   and stand back up without using your hands.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.840]   - Okay, so cross the feet,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.960]   for those that are just listening, cross the feet,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   and then just slowly lower yourself into a seated-
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   - Don't collapse.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.960]   Just lower yourself to the ground,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.640]   and then without putting your hands down or knee down,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.720]   can you stand back up?
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.080]   - And should one be able to do it
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   with either foot over the other?
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.440]   - Seems like I should use my left leg
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.600]   and right leg equally, right?
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.680]   I shouldn't have a good side and a bad side.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.960]   But what's interesting is the data, I think,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.680]   is that, like, it's a nice predictor
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.600]   of all-cause mortality and morbidity.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.840]   That's fine.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.120]   But what it really hints at is your changes
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   in how your body interacts with the environment.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.640]   That because you've adapted,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.800]   suddenly the skill that you've done 100,000 times,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   200,000 times as a kid, sitting criss-cross applesauce,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   you suddenly are confronted as an adult
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.840]   with a skill you can no longer perform.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   And it doesn't require massive hip range of motion,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.080]   doesn't require full range of motion in your ankles.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.560]   It's actually a really fair test.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.920]   But if you're missing some of these end ranges,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.960]   you're gonna struggle.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.080]   And it's nice now that I have this, like,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.520]   what's the session cost?
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.000]   I've become a, I love cycling.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.280]   Mountain biking's my jam.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.360]   But if I ride my bike a ton, my hips get super tight.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.000]   But if I have some assessments, just like vital signs,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.160]   blood pressure, 120 over 80, that's not good blood pressure,
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   but it's a nice, decent reference.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.160]   Now I create some movement minimums
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   that help me understand how my body's interacting
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.320]   with stress, environment, nutrition, exercise, et cetera.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.240]   - For some people, maybe me,
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.400]   if I were to sit cross-legged on the ground for a bit
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   and then stand up, if it hasn't been in a while,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.280]   I'm like, kind of like, just, kind of ache.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.080]   But I consider myself pretty mobile.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.440]   Once I warm up, I can run for an hour and a half,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.480]   jog for an hour and a half.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.080]   Once I get warmed up in the gym,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.800]   I can move what, at least for me,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.280]   is satisfying amounts of weight.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.800]   So I wouldn't say that I'm out of shape.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.680]   I wouldn't say I'm in spectacular shape.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.240]   Is it normal for us after a certain age
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.680]   to kind of feel like we creak or ache
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.960]   as we move in or out of a new movement?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.840]   I mean, is that, does it fit
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.400]   with being still a healthy person
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.200]   or should we just not have any of those kinds of like,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.000]   that was like, the guy that like-
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.560]   - Dude, I sat on the ground, that was rough.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.400]   - Yeah. - That was super rough.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   - Yeah, maybe, you know, sitting for 30 minutes
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.000]   and then standing up and feeling like
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.200]   you have to kind of open yourself up
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.840]   with a can opener, so to speak.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.320]   - Well, a couple of things there.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.160]   One is that you said new movement.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.800]   So one of the ways we define best athlete
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.640]   is who's the person who can transfer the skill,
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.560]   their current skillset,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   and pick up the new skill the fastest.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.120]   So what I'll say is,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.920]   if you want to test how fit you are,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   how good your program is,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.320]   go ahead and jump someone else's program.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.480]   Let me know how that goes.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.840]   Can you perform the skills?
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   Are you skilled?
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.120]   You're not kidding. - I'm chuckling
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.760]   'cause I joined Cameron Haynes for his weight workout,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.480]   which is, you know, high-repetition circuit work
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.400]   that went on for about 45 minutes.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.240]   None of the weights were particularly heavy,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.000]   but it's just nonstop.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   I was sore, and I normally don't get sore
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.400]   for more than a half day, if at all.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.840]   Soreness hasn't really ever been an issue for me.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.680]   I was sore for almost a week and a half,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.280]   maybe two weeks, but it was insane.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.120]   It was, yeah.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.960]   - This is so good.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.640]   It opens up the next thing, right?
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.040]   Founder of CrossFit, Greg Glassman,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.600]   one of my earliest influences coaches,
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.520]   says, "We fail the margins of our experience."
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   So what you just saw was,
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.680]   hey, here is this metabolic pathway range work
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.280]   that I have not inoculated myself to.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.400]   And I think we're at an interesting place
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   where fitness has become hobby.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   Fitness has become sort of my personal pastime.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.800]   And I can go to the gym, and I can look jacked.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.920]   You're jacked and tan.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.360]   You're very handsome, 49-year-old.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.000]   But what we start to see is
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.240]   the things that make us look aesthetically pleasing,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.120]   or I'm functional enough,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.240]   isn't the same thing as preparing for sport
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.160]   or transferring to new skill.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.360]   And in fact, I would say if I had a spectrum of activities,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.880]   I'd put like fitnessing over here.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.760]   Like I go to a camp, I just do a million reps.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.080]   I breathe hard, it's super fun.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   I'm in Zumba, I'm mirroring,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   and I have positive regard, and I see my friends.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.440]   On the other side,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.920]   we have very much sports-specific training.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.320]   The only goal is to support the sport.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.640]   If you're an elite soccer player,
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.920]   we have goals off season,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.400]   but in the season, it's to support your body to win.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.600]   But one step back from that,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.640]   I call sports preparation training,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.840]   which is where we start to see
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.560]   sort of some really pattern interference
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.000]   between what the internet says I should do
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.440]   to have huge quads
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.720]   and the best way to create an elite sprinter
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.000]   or an elite footballer, right?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.600]   In that sports preparation training,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.920]   I can be, think of it, GPP plus looking at positions
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.280]   and how things transfer.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.040]   A Franz Bosch is a great example
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.960]   of sports preparation training.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.360]   He's a Dutch thinker.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.280]   His books are great.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.880]   And you'll see, understand
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.760]   that really what we're trying to do
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.880]   in sports preparation is say,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.720]   "Hey, what is this complex system in front of us?
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.920]   "What's the minimal amount of input
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.080]   "so that we can still go and project ourselves
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.480]   "into the world through sport and performance?"
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.000]   And on the other side,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.520]   suddenly we do come up confronted with,
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.400]   "Hey, I'm doing this thing,
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.840]   "and I jump in with my friend and I get brutalized,"
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.520]   which is actually a problem that we have
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.720]   with people, really good fit athletes,
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.160]   and I throw them into like a group fitness class,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.080]   and they can do so much work
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.440]   that they wreck themselves for weeks.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.400]   And that's probably what happened.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.840]   You're so strong,
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.160]   and you know how to just be uncomfortable,
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.040]   and then you just did this freakish amount of work
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.920]   without giving yourself a chance to adapt.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.480]   And that happens all the time.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   - So going back to the getting down on the ground once a day,
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.680]   and then getting up,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   I'd like to just,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.600]   I want to get to fitness and sports training as well,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.120]   but is there another practice
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.480]   or set of practices related
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.800]   to where we do our profession work?
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.540]   So I can stand,
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.380]   I have a standing desk,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.360]   I have a drafting table,
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   and I'll sit stand.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.840]   I'll stand for a while, I'll sit,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   stand for a while, I'll sit.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.760]   I have a stool.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.040]   I like to be at a stool
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.940]   that's where my back is not supported.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.960]   And so I try and vary it as much as I can.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.800]   - Love that.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.240]   - And thanks to you,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.680]   thanks to your recommendation that is,
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.160]   I bought one of those little kickstands
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.400]   that goes underneath the desk from Rogue.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.600]   I don't have any financial relationship to Rogue.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.440]   I've sent them--
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.280]   - No, you're making tens of dollars
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   on this fidget stand.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.040]   - No, I sent them money like everyone else would.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.640]   One could probably build one too.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.680]   This is a little fidget stand.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680]   I love that thing.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.560]   'Cause it reminds me to swing my foot while I'm there,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.840]   even while I'm standing.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.940]   So that's what I've done
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.680]   to try and keep some mobility during the day.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.960]   - And I want to double click on that
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.360]   because that's really amazing.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.320]   'Cause what you've done is said,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640]   hey, I can't control this aspect of my environment.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.120]   I have to do some deep work.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.800]   That means I might need to perch
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.280]   or I might have to sit at a conference table.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.360]   And then what we can start to say is,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.180]   well, what other choices do I have?
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.920]   And now if we work with a typical person
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.800]   and you say you have some agency before you leave for work
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.520]   and then your agency doesn't return until you get home,
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.540]   what are you gonna do during the day
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.280]   to keep the body moving?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.020]   So that it's easier to escape to your afternoon class.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.680]   I think that's the thing.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.040]   And what you've just described
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   is what my wife would call a movement-rich environment.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.920]   How do I pepper the environment with inputs
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.580]   so that I'm not just in a tiny movement language?
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.520]   I love that.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.600]   I want to go back to the sitting on the ground.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.720]   Should it be painful?
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.820]   Should it be sore?
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.200]   One aspect of your physiology that will not change,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.440]   doesn't have to change, is your range of motion.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.260]   As you get older.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.080]   We should be able to maintain our range of motion.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.920]   So what's interesting is that
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.960]   if we're suddenly confronted with tasks
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.020]   that ask us to be in certain positions
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.280]   that we're not comfortable with, we're gonna be sore.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.120]   You bet.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.080]   You're gonna have to squeeze your butt.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.420]   And something you said earlier, like once I'm warmed up,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.540]   I love that phrase, right?
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.960]   Once I've had my 27 supplements
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.460]   and my coffee and my activation,
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.120]   I've gotten to my sauna, I can do anything.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.520]   I feel great.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.720]   The real question is, should I have to do all that stuff?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.480]   For high performance, absolutely.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.640]   But should I have to do all of this prep
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.480]   to have native range of motion?
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   To have baseline range of motion?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.320]   Probably not.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.720]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.360]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.920]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.040]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.480]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.560]   all of your foundational nutritional needs
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.700]   and it tastes great.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.440]   Now I've been drinking AG1 since 2012.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.880]   And I started doing that at a time
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.360]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.240]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.560]   to purchase one supplement.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.600]   And I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.840]   The reason for that is,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.760]   even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.500]   from whole foods and minimally processed foods,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.480]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.200]   vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.400]   micronutrients and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.280]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.100]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.560]   I sleep well at night and keep my immune system strong.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.040]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.720]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.300]   my physical health, my mental health and my performance,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.520]   both cognitive and physical are better.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.080]   I know that because I've had lapses
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.320]   when I didn't take AG1
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.200]   and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.080]   given the relationship
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.200]   between the gut microbiome and the brain,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.240]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid morning
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.380]   and again later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.520]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.980]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.080]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.460]   to claim a special offer.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.720]   Right now they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.280]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.740]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.340]   to claim that special offer.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.640]   - Well, as long as we're there,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.140]   I'm just gonna tell you what's worked best for me
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.440]   in terms of warming up.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.520]   And I'd love to know your thoughts.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.120]   Years ago, I think it was a Charles Poliquin poster
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.280]   or something like that,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.160]   where it was suggested to do
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.100]   relatively low repetition warmup.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.940]   - Love it.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.120]   - As opposed to going in and doing 15 reps,
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.960]   then 10, then eight or whatever it is.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.840]   And I've found over the years,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.880]   what's allowed me to get strongest
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.120]   and stay strongest for me is to,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.740]   sure, I'll go in and do the first set of a movement,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.920]   a resistance training movement of maybe eight repetitions,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.880]   just to get some blood flowing and remind my brain.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.720]   - Practice.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.780]   - You know, what the range of motion is right.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.480]   Then I'll do maybe just, you know,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.160]   five, four, two repetitions of subsequent three sets.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.480]   So five, four, and then two repetition sets
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.280]   with heavier loads.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.360]   And it's just to prepare my nervous system
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.240]   for heavier loads.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.320]   And then when I start my actual quote-unquote work sets,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.880]   I can get a lot more real work done.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.920]   And this for me was like spit in the face
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.820]   of everything I had read,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.920]   everything I'd seen that you need to do,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.640]   higher repetition warmups.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.860]   And it has allowed me to progress more or less continuously
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.640]   over the decades that I've been training.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.420]   And I'm not a natural athlete.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.260]   I'm just not.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.160]   I've trained for a long, long time,
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.960]   but I would never fall under what you would call
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.180]   like natural athlete.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.680]   I don't have a low recovery quotient, all that stuff.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.480]   And so for me, it was like a shocker,
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.580]   but it makes total sense.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.160]   Prepare the nervous system for the work you're about to do.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.940]   And don't follow some preconceived idea
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.600]   that you have to do high repetition warmup
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.560]   or even moderate repetition warmup.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   And lo and behold, you get much stronger.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.600]   And if you want to grow muscle, you can grow more muscle.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.160]   Why haven't we heard more about this?
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.740]   Why don't people in fitness talk more?
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.840]   I know you do, and please do.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.520]   Talk about the nervous system.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.000]   And the fact that it's not just all about warming up
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.180]   and getting blood flow.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.980]   It's really about preparing the brain and spinal cord
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.820]   and all this stuff in there.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.380]   - Yeah, love that.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.460]   Let's say a couple of variables there.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.260]   What's your training age, right?
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.140]   If I can take a beginner and you in the same thing,
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.100]   we can make big jumps.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.460]   You and I have been, we've deadlifted together a decade ago.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.140]   Like we can just go.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.140]   We know our bodies, the patterns are well ingrained.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.500]   Our tissues have exposure here, right?
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   There's some things we can do.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.660]   So I love that you're starting to see
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.780]   that what's the minimal amount of warmup
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.280]   to do the task.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.880]   And on some days you may be sore, maybe stiff,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.440]   and it takes a little more time to go,
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.680]   get right underneath it.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.360]   One of the things I think we have this opportunity to do
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.920]   is put play back into warmups.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.620]   So one of the things is that I suspect,
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.640]   and please correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.120]   you don't find a lot of joy in doing these like
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.160]   rote A, B, the world's greatest stretch,
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   wah, wah, wah, do the active.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.360]   Like, it's not that fun.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.980]   So what, let me talk about my experience
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.580]   working with a team at Berkeley.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.700]   I have this shout out to the women's water polo team
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.820]   at Berkeley who are my just total family.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.380]   These women are incredible.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.260]   But I came into the sport and looked around
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.300]   and I saw really ineffective warmups
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.900]   that weren't a good use of the time,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   that didn't prepare us to get into a fight in 20 minutes
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.380]   or 30 minutes later.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.700]   So if you went through your warmup and said,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.060]   "I'm gonna be in a fight."
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.360]   Am I prepared for that or not?
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.160]   And that's a nice like rubric to say,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.740]   I'm nervous system arousal, I have a little sweat on,
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.420]   I've practiced, right?
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.880]   You know, I've touched some positions and shapes.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.040]   But you know, what I see is that there's,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.360]   in the typical training session,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.320]   there's a lot of work to get done.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.040]   So now I think training has become very, very dense.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.120]   You know, here's this piece, here's this piece,
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.560]   now I do the succession work, I gotta hit these,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.480]   these cart, and so the warmup for me
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.680]   has been one of the last places
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.540]   where I can get you to explore new movements,
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.020]   something you saw on the internet, play around.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.000]   If you came to my gym, you know,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.680]   or we came to my house now, I'd be like,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.760]   "Let's go throw the medicine ball for five minutes."
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.020]   And there's no wrong way,
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.680]   but I want you to start to explore speed.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.920]   I want you to explore catching an object and going fast.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.160]   And what we haven't done, and I suspect,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.700]   I wouldn't say that your warmup is the best way,
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.300]   I'd say it's one way to get to the thing
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.040]   that we want faster and potentially you stop doing
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   what didn't work and what didn't serve you,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   which I really want people to understand
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.880]   is that if you're not blind going through some program,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.040]   I want you to say, "Does this serve me?"
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   Because my experience working now 20 years
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.240]   with the best teams and athletes
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.040]   and organizations on the planet is athletes do what work
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.280]   and they stop doing what doesn't work.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.680]   Isn't that interesting, right?
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.600]   So what I love is that you started to get
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.480]   under heavy loads relatively quickly
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.280]   in movements you had real competency and exposure with.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.760]   Yes, because what we wanna do is come back to say,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.640]   "What's the least amount of work I can do
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.680]   to have the biggest adaptation?"
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.240]   And three hours in the gym doesn't fit into your life
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.080]   and it doesn't fit into the typical person's life.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.440]   And theoretically, you're gonna have to go do a sport.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.420]   So you're gonna have to recover from this sport
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.600]   and this training session, right?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.000]   You're like, "Hey, I can't even handle this high volume.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.120]   You know, it's a ding on me too.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.180]   I can't handle the same high volume as my friends can."
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.240]   So wasting your time in quotation marks
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.180]   with lots of high volume sets of an empty barbell
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.240]   might've been useful at some point
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.120]   and maybe it doesn't serve you as well now.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.360]   Or because you have to put so many plates on that bar,
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.760]   that's just, that's a warmup by itself, right?
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.600]   - That's not an issue for me.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.060]   - So you walked a mile to load those plates.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.160]   - No, that's not an issue for me,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.800]   but that's a perfect, what you just said,
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.440]   is a perfect opportunity for me to mention something
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.640]   that I've noticed, which prompts a question,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.440]   which is I noticed that I have some asymmetry.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.200]   My right shoulder naturally sits a little lower
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.220]   than my left, and whenever I get a little back tweak,
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.080]   it's always on the same side, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.140]   I know this varies for everybody.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.020]   And I noticed that I was always picking up the weights
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.680]   and re-racking them, 'cause I re-rack my weights
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.440]   like a grown-up, re-racking them on the same side.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.000]   So I've made it a point now to switch up, you know,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.240]   which side of my body I do them from.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.160]   - Yeah, yeah, that's great.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.620]   - And notice I'm significantly weaker
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.880]   on one side of my body.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.280]   I mean, not to the point where, you know,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.280]   I have to use two different sets of dumb,
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.300]   or two different dumbbells if I'm doing curls or something,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.800]   but just noticing these natural asymmetries starting
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.120]   to show up because I'm a right-hander or who knows,
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.080]   or I skateboarded.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.660]   So, you know, I've spent a lot of my life, early life,
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.480]   with my left foot forward and my right foot pushing.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.040]   And as a consequence, there are a lot of asymmetries.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.800]   So what I've tried to do is correct those asymmetries
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.520]   in the between movement movements,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.600]   but also to stagger my stance during curls
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.520]   and then switch it each time,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.880]   or maybe even overemphasize the weaker side.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.360]   I have no professional training in any of this.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.400]   I've just found that it's made for better posture,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.240]   more evenly distributed strength.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.840]   And I must say, all of that is based on teachings
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.220]   that I read in your books and through conversations
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.000]   with you about, hey, we have these natural imbalances,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.780]   and there are little things that we can do
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.760]   that take moments that can correct those imbalances.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.280]   So if you would, could you sort of expand on the number
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.040]   and type of imbalances that you most commonly see
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.000]   and some ways for people to remedy them, excuse me.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.160]   - Let's, if we just took the word imbalance
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.440]   and put it to the side for a second,
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.380]   because it's sort of a nonspecific term,
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.720]   like, are we testing your hamstring to your quad?
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.120]   Like, what's the ideal ratio here?
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.040]   Like, if you're a professional pitcher,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   I hope your arm, right arm,
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.160]   looks different than your left arm, right?
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.460]   But what we can say is, number one,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.640]   imbalances don't necessarily cause pain.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   Let's be clear about that.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   We should be using our time in the gym
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.320]   as training to find deficiencies in blind spots,
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.440]   in our patterns, in our skill,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.920]   in our, you know, in our brains feeling comfortable
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.840]   with a certain movement.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.960]   And what you just hit was that it's, boy,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.520]   it's really easy to get a lot of variability
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.040]   just doing the things I want to do anyway.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.800]   So now I'm in a tandem stance.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.480]   I skate left foot forward, right?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.280]   But, you know, suddenly that's my dominant stance
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.360]   if you're gonna ask me to do anything of consequence,
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.880]   I'm gonna adopt that stance.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.160]   But suddenly I get to have some exposure here.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.720]   So what's the point of the gym?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.480]   What's the point of training?
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.600]   Just to work on some cardiorespiratory output,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   you know, that the science says?
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.120]   Is it to move and to play?
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.360]   Is it to, you know, if the brain's a, you know,
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.240]   problem-solving machine,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.640]   let's give it some problems to solve.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.880]   So you suddenly have a new problem to solve.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.920]   And I would even say that weakness
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   isn't even the right idea.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   It's just like, here's a pattern
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.480]   that I'm not as effective at, as efficient at.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.000]   So when we go into the gym sort of
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.920]   with this great curiosity,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.000]   then it's a really rich place
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.960]   and a really, frankly, the only safe place
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.320]   because there isn't contact and sport
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.040]   and we're not fighting and dancing and moving.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.560]   And we can really do this controlled formal movement
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   where we can really see inputs and outputs.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.480]   I explained to my mother-in-law a long time ago
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.640]   what was happening when we were developing our model
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.200]   to understand movement.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.600]   And I was, and I explained it and she was like,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.560]   "Oh, you mean it makes the invisible visible?"
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.400]   That's right.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.680]   It's that this is a place to understand
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.960]   how your range of motion is changing,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.000]   how your skills are changing, right?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.400]   Over the course of a season
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.440]   or the course of, you know,
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.520]   something going on in your life, a season in your life,
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.440]   suddenly you're like, "Wow, my left hip is a little tight
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.880]   or my left shoulder is, my internal rotation is going away."
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.640]   Hard to see when you're swimming.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.320]   Really easy to see when we dumbbell snatch, right?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.280]   And what we're trying to do then is take the gym,
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.720]   not only have it be a stimulus for adaptation,
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.600]   but have it be a really great place
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.240]   to uncover changes in my movement,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.560]   changes in expression of that movement.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.360]   And so really what you see, again,
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.000]   if I just do this one thing over and over again,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   that's patterning, that's repetition, that's practice, right?
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.720]   And what you've done is just said,
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.440]   "Hey, let me change my brain.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   Let me open the door handle with my left side."
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.560]   And coming into the gym with that curiosity
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.120]   means that we can have seven bottom lines.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.560]   We're working on your fascia.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.000]   We're working on these energy systems.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.880]   We're working on these movement skills,
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.040]   but simultaneously we can have fun.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.080]   We can work on understanding our range of motion.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.000]   So for me, I think it's easier to say,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   let's frame mobility as do you, here's my definition.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.240]   Do you have access to normative range of motion?
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.560]   The range of motion every physician,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.160]   every physical therapist, every chiro agrees on.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.800]   Shoulder, it's 180 degrees of flexion.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.640]   - So for those listening,
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.760]   this is lifting your arm above head
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.240]   so you can bring your hand basically,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.040]   you know, above the center of your head.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.880]   - And what you can see right now
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.360]   is Andrew has his elbow bent,
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.880]   his head tipped to the side, his internally rotated.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.120]   He's solving the problem, which is what his brain is saying.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.640]   - Compensation, you're better on this side now.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.960]   - If you want to use the word compensation,
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.360]   I want to put that on you.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.760]   But what I'd say is that's an incomplete position.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.400]   Doesn't mean you have pain.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.040]   Doesn't mean you're not the world champion,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.480]   but it means we may have some latent capacity we could chase.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.600]   And the next question for me then is,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.160]   what is it that's missing potentially in your training
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.000]   that we're not having this exposure?
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.480]   We're not doing enough close grip hanging,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.640]   we're not doing seesaw press, right?
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   Where the arm is straight up,
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.840]   we're always gripping on a barbell, right?
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.200]   I'm not handling enough dumbbells or kettlebells overhead.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.160]   And then we can say, well,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.600]   do I need some position transfer exercises,
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.200]   some mobility work to restore that so we can use it again?
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.360]   And then more importantly,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.840]   how does that turn up for you in a way
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.320]   that impacts your sport or your job?
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.720]   That's what's really interesting.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.160]   - Yeah, so what I'm hearing is that
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.280]   when we go into the gym
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.240]   or wherever we do our resistance training work,
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   that we should think about it as a place to,
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.400]   yes, perform to exceed our previous reps and sets.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.240]   - That's fun.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.080]   - Yeah, 'cause that's part of the-
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.280]   - It's fun and easy to measure.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.680]   Hardly see, are you getting better at soccer?
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.080]   But I put another keel on my bench today.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.980]   Like, that's fun.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.100]   - Lex Friedman, who of course everybody knows
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.000]   from the Lex Friedman podcast,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.880]   likes to make fun of Americans 'cause he's Russian,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.900]   but he's actually American now,
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.740]   for being meatheads,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.760]   'cause we like to spend so much time in gyms,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.920]   working out as opposed to doing sports.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.360]   And I assure him that I've also done and do sports now,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.160]   but he likes to make that point.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.040]   And I think it's a fair one in that,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.720]   well, he's a resilient jujitsu guy.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.740]   So in any event,
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.240]   the gym is also a place for diagnosis,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.740]   to diagnose where we don't have as much range of motion
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.980]   as we could.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.740]   And that's very helpful, I think, for people to hear,
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.940]   because most people are time limited.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:49.920]   They don't have...
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.340]   If they're getting their two or three
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.860]   resistance training workouts per week,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.980]   plus two or three cardiovascular training workouts,
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.220]   and they're listening to Peter Ortega,
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.660]   so they're trying to hang from a bar
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.340]   for 90 seconds or more,
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.380]   and they're doing some farmer carries,
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.420]   and they're doing their zone two,
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.580]   and they're throwing on a weight vest,
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.600]   and they got either fidgeting under their desk.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.280]   At some point, you can start to understand
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.120]   why people are like,
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.540]   "Whoa, this is starting to become overwhelming."
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.000]   What you're talking about is
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.280]   going and doing your typical workout,
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.440]   but paying attention to where some,
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.520]   for lack of a better word, I'll call them asymmetries,
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.280]   or not full range of motion being expressed,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.320]   where that might be happening.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.840]   I love, I keep coming back to this,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.380]   but this thing about getting down onto the ground
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.800]   for 30 minutes each night while watching TV,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   or maybe even while eating dinner,
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.540]   or while talking to your family or partner.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.620]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.640]   It also gives me an excuse to push the sofas
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.520]   off to the side of the room,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.540]   'cause I have this weird neuroticism
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.100]   about furniture in the middle of the room.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.460]   So I'm imagining getting mats down on the floor
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.300]   of the living room.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.940]   And suddenly, we're not programming another thing
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.820]   that's, I think, one of the things that's happened,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.740]   and it's a good thing.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.020]   It's a feature of the system.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.500]   Strength and energy in the last 20 years
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.780]   has become very sophisticated.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.880]   So, Juliette and I, my wife and CEO,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.100]   opened our gym in 2005.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.300]   - This was the CrossFit gym at the Presidio.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.140]   - That's right.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.100]   - Beautiful location.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.980]   - 21st CrossFit in the world.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.040]   But we couldn't buy a kettlebell in San Francisco.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.420]   We had to drive to Santa Cruz.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.620]   - That says a lot about San Francisco.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.380]   I can say that 'cause I'm from the Bay Area.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.080]   - But there was one place in Santa Cruz that sold them,
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.920]   Played Against Sports,
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.160]   that imported these Russian kettlebells.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.420]   Thank you, Pavel.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.140]   And we had to make this trek down to buy them.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.220]   So, the fitness, I think we,
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.860]   I bought my first pair of Olympic-lifting shoes
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.020]   out of the back of someone's car, like a drug deal.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   - Olympic-lifting shoes?
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.520]   You just couldn't buy 'em.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.360]   - Flat-soled shoes.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.820]   - No, actually, an Olympic-lifting shoe with a heel.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.940]   But you can buy those at three different stores
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.020]   in Malibu right now.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.220]   You go right over there.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.920]   You can buy kettlebells at Target.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   So, the world has become much more sophisticated.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.860]   Sometimes, like, the overhead squat is a good example.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.380]   Fantastic diagnostic tool.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.340]   Tells us a lot.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.620]   - So, bar held overhead.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.440]   - And squat down.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.280]   Super simple.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.340]   All you have to do is have normal range of motion
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.620]   and your joints and tissues.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.060]   Well, that helps.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.060]   Juliette likes to say I was bendy before I was big.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.540]   But, you know, the idea here, though,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.460]   is let's go ahead and also put skill back into this.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.560]   But most people weren't overhead squatting at all.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.640]   It wasn't part of their language.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.020]   Now, everyone knows what an overhead squat is, right?
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.380]   Dan John, CrossFit.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.820]   All the Olympic lifters have been doing this forever.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:36.260]   But what we are seeing is that the natural evolution
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.540]   of fitness and strength and conditioning
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.900]   is that we've become,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.460]   we've gotten really decorative in our rooms.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.300]   So, we create this room that's just,
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.120]   every inch has a knick-knack, has an assistance.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.220]   This is my tib raise.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.540]   This is my neck thing.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.940]   It's a very decorative experience.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.580]   And instead of asking what was essential
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.640]   in terms of energy systems and positions that I can train
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.780]   so that I could go use those credits.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.220]   You know, for lack of a better word,
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.700]   fitness has become very recursive.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.300]   I have this zone two, so I can do more zone two,
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.220]   so I can do more zone two.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.140]   Or I have pull-ups because they get more pull-ups.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.500]   Instead of, well, how did that make you swim?
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.140]   What's the minimum amount of time we can spend in the gym
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.700]   so that you can go express that?
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.540]   Lex is right, in a sport or an activity.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.300]   And look, there are times in your life
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.220]   where the gym is the only thing you got.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.060]   You know, Juliette and I,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.580]   when we had two kids and a baby,
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.260]   or two kids in our businesses,
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.480]   we did the 10, 10, 10 at 10,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.560]   which is like 10 air squats, 10 kettlebell swings,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.720]   10 pull-ups at 10 p.m. for 10 minutes.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.800]   And I was like, elite, my fitness is elite.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.640]   - Do you do that every day?
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.760]   - Well, I just did it when I could do it, right?
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.080]   Because that's all I could fit in.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.940]   So, you know, I think what's happened
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.220]   is we have now sold people this idea
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.560]   that fitness happens in a one-hour block.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.840]   And if it's not an hour, you know,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.920]   then it's not worth doing.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.240]   And if you kept a bar loaded in your garage,
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.100]   you could walk out there and do sets
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.680]   in between making dinner.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.020]   You kept a kettlebell in your kitchen,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.180]   you could do povals, four swings on the minute
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.340]   for 20 minutes, and at least have some exposure loading.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.980]   So a long way around the barn of saying,
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.860]   I want to protect your gym time
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.780]   because it's really sacred, amazing time
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.540]   where you can have fun, explore ranges,
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.340]   get strong, get jacked, feel great about yourself,
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.660]   interact with your friends.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.460]   And what I don't want to do is encroach any more
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.500]   on that magic time because we have a lot to get done
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.120]   in the gym physiologically.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.480]   If we're gonna compete against these other teams,
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.720]   if we're gonna beat Stanford,
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.160]   we're gonna need to really maximize that time in the gym.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.000]   So that means we need to push out
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.440]   some of these other behaviors
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.760]   so we're not stacking them in
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.840]   and they're eroding the time we could be squatting
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.800]   or benching or cleaning or running or sprinting
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.320]   or cutting or playing.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.960]   - You mentioned warming up with play,
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.280]   which I think is a wonderful concept
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.640]   and presumably brings about more dynamic movement.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.840]   - 100%.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.360]   - And another reason I like it is that
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.260]   I loathe warming up aside from the types of warmups
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.620]   that I just described.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.640]   - I hate it.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.420]   - And I'm beginning to realize
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.920]   that the way I've been training,
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.860]   even though it's been, I would say useful
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.460]   and successful for where I've been,
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.100]   I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.420]   heading into the new year.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.620]   This is not like a new year's episode.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.160]   This is evergreen because it's you,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.260]   but we have a new year coming.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.740]   A lot of people are going to naturally mark the time
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.040]   during and after the holidays as a transition point.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.480]   And if one wanted to start to,
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.080]   not necessarily completely restructure their fitness,
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.960]   but wanted to start incorporating a few things.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.880]   So we've got sitting down in the evening for 30 minutes.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.480]   We've got incorporating play into the warmup.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.360]   What would that look like?
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   Are we taking a tennis ball and bouncing it off the ground?
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.020]   We setting some rule in playing a game?
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:44.860]   - Sure.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.680]   - What if I'm alone?
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.520]   Am I playing a little handball type game against the wall?
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.200]   - Want to see something on the internet?
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.020]   Want to learn a new skill?
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.900]   This is the time to put it in.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.700]   I'm going to talk about my brilliant friend, David Weck.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.740]   He has something called rope flow that he created,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.480]   and it's just a piece of climbing rope.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.860]   And he will talk about all the things that will do for me.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.220]   I get a thousand PNF patterns.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.060]   I tie my upper body into my lower body.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.900]   - Could you explain PNF?
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:14.720]   Sorry, acronym.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.820]   - Sorry. Sorry, everyone.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:20.820]   That's a model of facilitating movement
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.960]   developed at Kaiser Vallejo.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.420]   It is by Knot and Cabot, I think.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.640]   Maybe I'm getting confused in those.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.800]   And anyway, the bottom line is this.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.860]   How do we help the body restore movement
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.200]   by using its own positional awareness?
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.040]   - Got it.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.800]   - So if you've ever done a hamstring stretch
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.640]   where someone holds you and you resist,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.280]   that contract relax is a style,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.720]   it's a technique born out of PNF.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.560]   - Got it. Sorry to interrupt.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.380]   - Okay, no problem. Perfect.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.840]   - So he's got these ropes.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.440]   - And so suddenly, like I use this with all my teams,
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.000]   is suddenly I'm spinning ropes.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.320]   I'm getting thousands of evolutions of the wrist turning,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.960]   the elbow turning, the shoulder turning.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.240]   I'm generating speed in weird positions
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.000]   that would be vulnerable and not as effective
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.280]   at high load, high stakes.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.960]   I get to twist.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   I can tie my eyes into it.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.560]   I can develop my stance.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.760]   And in five minutes of messing around,
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.000]   you're like, "Oh, I feel good."
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.060]   And we've added some speed to that, right?
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.480]   Because a lot of the warmups I see people do,
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.540]   I'm like, "Hey, there was no speed."
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.500]   You know what sport is?
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.340]   Speed.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.900]   And you haven't added any velocity to your training.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.180]   So where are we going to do that?
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.300]   - I love this.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.140]   I'm excited to.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.900]   - Dave Weck does a lot of amazing things.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.040]   His rope is a foundational piece of my,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.860]   if you work with me and you have shoulder pain and neck pain,
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.420]   you're going to get my shoulder spin up
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.420]   or David Weck's rope flow every day.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.740]   That's part of our homework.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.200]   What are we going to do to give you exposure
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.320]   and restore what you're supposed to do with your body?
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.640]   - So walk into the gym, use the bathroom, hydrate,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.600]   whatever it is you need to do.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.080]   And then five to 10 minutes
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.040]   of some play type dynamic activity.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.560]   - Throw a medicine ball around,
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.120]   jump on a mini trampoline,
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.680]   pick up a barbell, do a complex,
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.020]   do some breath hold work.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.400]   This is a perfect place to lay in all the breath hold work.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.240]   I think they call it dry face breath holding, right?
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.880]   It's this dynamic apnea work
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.720]   where you're basically holding your breath.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.020]   So for example, with our teams,
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.200]   we try to, I try to have, this is a magic number,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.720]   seven sort of hypoxic events
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.600]   where we do something on a breath hold
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.400]   until the athlete has a crisis and has to breathe.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.660]   And part of that is I want to get the brain ready
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.120]   for these high CO2 levels, right?
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.200]   And I want to challenge respiration.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.040]   And it's so easy.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.160]   Get on the bike.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.120]   Here's something everyone can do.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.060]   For five minutes,
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.440]   I want you to take a 10 second inhale on the bike,
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.520]   hold your breath as long as you can.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.440]   When the bomb goes off in your face,
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.040]   recover nose only.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.440]   Start at the next one at the next minute.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.800]   And what you're going to see is, wow,
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.000]   that was really uncomfortable,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.120]   really psychologically preparing myself to get into a fight.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.920]   That came from the French free divers.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.160]   One of the coaches I was working with was like,
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.400]   here's something we used to do with our French free divers.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.760]   I was like, this is so good.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.640]   McKenzie, Laird Hamilton, Wim Hof,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.480]   the people who've been exposing us
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.160]   to dynamic apnea work is amazing.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.940]   But that's another example of something I can do
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.800]   instead of mindlessly just being on
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.280]   and I got to get a sweat.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.120]   Like let's go ahead and just layer in play and destruction.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:18.960]   - I love it.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.920]   - Do not lay on the ground in foam roll.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.360]   Do not lay on the ground in foam roll.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.280]   That's the worst way to get ready for a fight ever.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.640]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.340]   and thank one of our sponsors, Function.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.960]   I recently became a Function member
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.260]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.280]   to lab testing.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.200]   While I've long been a fan of blood testing,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.160]   I really wanted to find a more in-depth program
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.800]   for analyzing blood, urine, and saliva
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.680]   to get a full picture of my heart health,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.460]   my hormone status, my immune system regulation,
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.720]   my metabolic function, my vitamin and mineral status,
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.160]   and other critical areas of my overall health and vitality.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.880]   Function not only provides testing
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.340]   of over a hundred biomarkers,
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.000]   key to physical and mental health,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.860]   but it also analyzes these results
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.420]   and provides insights from top doctors on your results.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.260]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.380]   I learned that I had two high levels of mercury in my blood.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.680]   This was totally surprising to me.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.500]   I had no idea prior to taking the test.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.360]   Function not only helped me detect this,
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.840]   but offered medical doctor-informed insights
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.540]   on how to best reduce those mercury levels,
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.840]   which included limiting my tuna consumption
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.600]   because I had been eating a lot of tuna,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.960]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.880]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.940]   both of which can support glutathione production
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.680]   and detoxification and worked to reduce my mercury levels.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.260]   Comprehensive lab testing like this
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.660]   is so important for health.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.460]   And while I've been doing it for years,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.380]   I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.860]   I've been so impressed by Function,
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.780]   both at the level of ease of use,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.300]   that is getting the tests done,
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.860]   as well as how comprehensive
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.380]   and how actionable the tests are,
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.620]   that I recently joined their advisory board.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.860]   And I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.180]   If you'd like to try Function,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.460]   go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.060]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.640]   but they're offering early access
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.880]   to Huberman Lab listeners.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.160]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.320]   to get early access to Function.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.620]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.320]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.360]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.480]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.060]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.160]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.760]   physical health, and performance.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.000]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.320]   that you get a great night's sleep
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.840]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.120]   And that's because in order to fall
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.580]   and stay deeply asleep,
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.360]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.900]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.400]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.340]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.920]   about one to three degrees.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.500]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.720]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.280]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.880]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.560]   middle, and end of the night.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.200]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.440]   for nearly four years now,
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.320]   and it has completely transformed
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.880]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.040]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.660]   of the pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.840]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.040]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.480]   and even has snoring detection
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.780]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.160]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.320]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.680]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.240]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.840]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.360]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.240]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.560]   Somehow, and we can talk about how, it's not a coincidence,
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.580]   you became synonymous with foam rolling.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.440]   - Worst part of my life. - It became synonymous
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.260]   with you.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.720]   That's okay.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.760]   I mean, it's not okay, but it's okay with me.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.600]   They weren't saying about me,
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.080]   but I was about to say it's okay.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.720]   Anytime somebody goes public facing
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.840]   and starts to try and educate people,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.980]   there's certain things that are sticky.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.880]   They have high salience.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.320]   Yes, I like to get into a cold plunge,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.160]   but how I, how Andrew Huberman became associated
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.100]   with cold plunging or buying a cold plunge is wild.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.560]   I mean, sure, I own one and this sort of thing.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.280]   And I think they're great for shifting your state,
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:17.240]   but it's hardly the cornerstone of my life or my existence,
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.080]   but I love it.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.720]   I use it, but I think foam rolling,
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.680]   I think looked different enough
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.520]   from what people had not seen before.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.780]   And these things just, they have a stickiness to them.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.620]   Who knows why?
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.220]   What is the deal with foam rolling?
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.540]   Is there a utility to foam rolling?
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.920]   Absolutely.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.540]   Is there a wrong way to do it?
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.980]   No, but there's a way that's not a great use of your time.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.820]   Okay. Right.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.660]   So what we're all looking at is we have finite amount
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.060]   of time and what's my goal?
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.340]   To quickly touch my whole body?
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.540]   You know, what are we trying to do?
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.420]   So if I was using soft tissue mobilization
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.660]   and or using a roller or a ball or something,
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.260]   what's my goal here?
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.540]   Well, I think, and the research is very clear,
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.260]   it can help with pain, it can restore range of motion.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.300]   Again, very clear.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:10.460]   And I want to point out sort of one of my research friends,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.980]   Brent Brookbush, the Brookbush Institute
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.020]   has incredible summaries of musculoskeletal care.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.060]   Brent is a genius.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.060]   And if you go on his site, there's a little hourglass
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.780]   and you can search like sugar points
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.740]   and you'll see all of the deep dive research,
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.240]   analysis of the meta research.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.980]   Like you'll be like, okay, this is really excellent.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.580]   And it is tricky because, you know,
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:32.860]   what doesn't work for my body
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.940]   or wasn't a good use for time now is useless
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.520]   and it's easy to shout on the internet.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.660]   So what's our goal?
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.620]   If I was in pain and I was about to exercise,
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:45.600]   a quick two or three minute intervention working on,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.480]   let's call it desensitization of the tissues,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.460]   let's be mechanism agnostic for a second
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.340]   and say that's a really low level to entry safe,
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   highly effective way for you to suddenly feel better.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.340]   So we create a window of opportunity to move.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.260]   That's really cool.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.080]   I love that.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.660]   No physical therapist in the room.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:05.820]   No one went blind.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.860]   You didn't dislocate, right?
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.680]   So that could be a really excellent use
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.720]   of some soft tissue work.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.940]   The same way a boxer would go or an MMA fighter
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.860]   or the Olympic lifters in China,
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.820]   they have people who are giving non-threatening input
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.860]   to the body to tell the brain it's safe
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.220]   or to rehydrate something or get some,
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.180]   again, is it just stimulus
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.660]   so that the brain says it's safe?
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.620]   Sure.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.260]   Are we restoring how the tissues slide and glide?
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.660]   Sure.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.720]   A lot of times I think if you look at any
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.700]   of the mobility work, I'll just put writ large,
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.900]   really comes down to just doing a couple things.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.020]   Most of them are just isometrics.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.940]   So we have a lot of isometrics,
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.980]   which everyone can agree is good stuff.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.700]   And we do a lot of tempo work.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.480]   That's really just moving slowly through range.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.420]   It just may be that I'm using a different tool
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.780]   to have that isometric stimulus
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.420]   or that tempo moving slowly stimulus.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.980]   So we like to say, hey, let's use mobilizations,
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.280]   mobilizing the tissues.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.120]   Why are we doing it?
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.940]   What are we trying to do?
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.420]   Well, pain is a good reason.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.060]   And again, multifactorial, highly subjective.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.900]   Why do I have pain?
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.420]   Well, I got in a fight with my wife and I didn't eat
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.140]   and I twisted my knee back in Vietnam
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.060]   and who knows, right?
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.240]   But what are the inputs that I have
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.660]   to self-soothe and desensitize?
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.900]   And it turns out a ball and a roller is a really good one.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.820]   So I can use those to help myself feel better.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:29.980]   Did that solve the problem?
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.340]   Did that solve two weeks of shitty sleep?
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.700]   Did that solve my poor nutrition and lack of fiber?
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.540]   Did that solve the fact that I don't feel safe
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.380]   in this environment?
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.580]   No, but it got me a window of opportunity
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.580]   where I can go feel better in my body.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.520]   Is anyone against that?
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.660]   No, okay.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.260]   So what we can also say is,
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.140]   hey, this would be a great way to do what?
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.460]   Restore your range of motion.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.600]   Use a one tool and a system of tools
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.840]   to get you to do what?
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.840]   Have normative range again, right?
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.320]   For whatever reason, your lats are super stiff.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.120]   Again, it's more complicated than that,
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.800]   but sometimes it's not more complicated than that.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.720]   And if I just get you getting some input into there,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.560]   maybe I can restore that range of motion
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.000]   or create a window where you can go use it again.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.440]   Lastly, I would say is that it's a wonderful tool
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.560]   to decrease DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.080]   So in the evening, you blow out your quads,
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.200]   do a little soft tissue work.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.960]   And what you'll see is maybe that's blood flow.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.240]   Maybe it's non-threatening input.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.180]   Maybe it's just massage.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.400]   Maybe it's just the parasympathetic input
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.200]   that massage has, touch, right?
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.520]   Just down-regulates.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.360]   Maybe those are the reasons I feel better.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.520]   But the bottom line is, is that a good use of your time?
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.480]   Yes.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.220]   Are all techniques on the roller the same?
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.720]   No, right?
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   And I think that's where we've lost our minds
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.200]   is that if you just rolled up and down on your calf,
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.040]   didn't do anything.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.720]   It's like, yeah, well, you just, what are you doing, right?
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.220]   What if I rolled side to side?
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.560]   And so suddenly we can start to layer
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.300]   in some really complex thinking around this.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.140]   How about this?
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.760]   You have a roller out and I put my calf on there
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.640]   and I start rolling side to side.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.200]   Should that be uncomfortable?
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.800]   I'm guessing you're gonna say no,
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.640]   but anytime I've used a roller,
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.680]   anytime I've used a roller, I'm like, man, that hurts.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.200]   I don't want to do, that sucks.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.480]   Well, I mean, I don't mind it.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.400]   Like, it's not like the kind of,
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.000]   it's not like level eight pain or anything.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.600]   It's just, it's sort of like, it feels very localized.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.080]   Even if the roller is a big fat Costello
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.800]   the Bulldog size roller,
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.720]   it feels like someone's kind of kneading down
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.080]   in between my muscle fibers.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:33.920]   And then I started to think
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.120]   maybe I just have like low fiber density.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.840]   And if I were Mark Bell or something,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.400]   then this would feel comfortable.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.400]   But, you know, I always feel like the roller's
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.240]   going down to the bone.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.720]   - To the face of LFD, low fiber density.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.360]   So, you know, what I think we can do is
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.440]   let's establish some guidelines for people.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.040]   'Cause this is one of the ways
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.160]   that we can feel better in our home,
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.760]   without bourbon, without ibuprofen, without THC.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.040]   Like we need to give people some tools
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.800]   that don't, like that aren't just-
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   - Without having to buy a sauna.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   If you can afford one, great, but not every,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.040]   I mean, this whole thing with sauna, love saunas.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.760]   But, you know, well, until very recently in my life,
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.560]   like I couldn't afford a sauna.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.960]   Until very recently, you know,
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.560]   even as a tenured professor at Stanford,
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.440]   I'll just say that, right?
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.000]   - You can actually be angry at your parents
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.480]   for not giving you a sauna.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.040]   - You know, when I was a kid, my dad,
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.560]   and I used to go to the Y in the evening sometimes,
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.120]   or I was little, and I'd shoot baskets,
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.000]   or he would lift weights, Nautilus machines back then.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.440]   - Yeah, get brutally big on those.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.680]   - And then we'd sit in the sauna,
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.520]   or there was a hot tub.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.960]   - And you had a different set of trauma,
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.040]   traumatic experiences of sitting in the sauna at the Y.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   - No, actually, I learned how men,
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.480]   I learned how men over 40 spoke in 1985.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:51.720]   - There you go. - There you go.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.360]   If everyone had a roller and a ball,
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:58.200]   there's a lot of dysfunction and discomfort we can manage.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.520]   If you push on a tissue,
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:03.080]   we expect that tissue to be painless to compression,
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.960]   or not uncomfortable to compression.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.640]   Again, pain is a weird word.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.480]   I don't want to set that up,
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   but you shouldn't be uncomfortable to compression.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.600]   What's nice is that if I push on something,
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.560]   all I'm doing is just creating an isometric.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.920]   It's just a vector isometric.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.200]   Instead of pulling an isometric
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.120]   through the length of the tissue,
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.680]   I'm putting it at a different vector and angle.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.640]   So that would just be one.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.680]   I could start there, and if it was uncomfortable,
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.520]   well, guess what?
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.880]   Now I can get my nervous system involved.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.640]   So I can teach my brain
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.520]   that it's safe to create a contraction here.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.360]   So what do I do?
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.760]   Just flex, flex it, hold it for four seconds.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.080]   - This is very basic, I realize,
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.720]   but for many people, they're either already foam rolling
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.960]   and doing it incorrectly, or they're not foam rolling.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.320]   We want them to do it correctly.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.520]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.420]   it's "okay" to flex the muscle
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.480]   that you have in contact with the foam roller
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.320]   while you're rolling.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.640]   - If I find something that's uncomfortable or stiff,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.440]   or doesn't feel like my other side,
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.400]   I'm going to stop.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.200]   I found a place to work.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.720]   I'm going to build, take a big inhale.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.780]   So I take a four second inhale.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.560]   I want to teach myself
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.880]   that I need to be able to breathe in this position.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.920]   One of my friends, Greg Cook, is like,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.200]   "If you can't breathe in a position,
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.440]   you don't own a position."
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.720]   You know, that sounds very Iyengar, too.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.760]   But what we're going to do is we're going to say,
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.160]   "It's okay to breathe here, and I'm going to contract here."
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.600]   And then I'm going to slowly relax and soften.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.680]   That's tempo that's moving slowly,
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.440]   and I can handle higher loads.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.800]   And what'll end up happening
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.040]   is if I repeat that cycle two or three times,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:31.960]   guess what?
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.600]   My brain desensitizes that.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.640]   Changes range of motion.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.440]   My brain suddenly is like, "That's not a problem anymore."
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.800]   So we just move on.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.960]   And in two or three cycles of that contraction,
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.120]   breath, hold, long exhale,
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.840]   that starts to sound familiar, right?
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.180]   How do I calm down, long exhales?
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.640]   I'm not trying to spin up.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.320]   I'm trying to say, "This is safe."
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.560]   I've done that with my breath.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.080]   I've done that with contraction.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.960]   I'm just getting input in, just touch to my body,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.040]   especially on parts
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.740]   that maybe don't bark at me very often, right?
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.640]   People are shocked to learn
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.240]   that sometimes when they have knee pain,
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.960]   how stiff their quads are.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.280]   And then we can test it, load it, feel it, palpate it.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.920]   And I'm like, "Those things are just stiff."
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.660]   And when we un-stiffen them,
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.160]   whatever technique you want to use,
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.520]   restore sliding surfaces, get neural input in there,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.880]   we create range of motion.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.120]   Suddenly we change a motion dynamic,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.280]   improve deficiency.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.160]   The brain says, "Hey, that's no longer a threat,"
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.040]   or we're experiencing that as a new pattern or position,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.440]   that'd be enough to reduce your pain.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.880]   But pain isn't the only reason we're mobilizing.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.160]   We're mobilizing so that we can reduce session costs,
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.600]   so we can work out harder the next day
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.200]   and keep an eye on our minimums of our range of motion.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.040]   - Love this.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.600]   And another just very basic question,
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.440]   'cause I'll be honest,
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.360]   I haven't foam rolled much in my life.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.880]   - And it doesn't have to be a big foam roller, everyone.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.400]   Sometimes those big white, those are pool noodles, right?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.240]   That's what it was for.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.800]   I think like made in Killeen, Texas
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.200]   is like a manufacturing by-product.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.120]   And someone's like, "We could put these in the pool."
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   And then some physical therapist was like, "Sweet."
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.080]   Like that thing's way too big and too hard
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.040]   and too square and too soft.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.800]   Like there's a whole bunch of things.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.980]   Like sometimes you need an elbow,
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.400]   sometimes you need a forearm, sometimes you need a thumb.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.200]   So you can have much smaller diameter.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.400]   I'm a much bigger fan of smaller diameter rollers.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.480]   I just think they fit your body better.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.840]   - Thank you for that.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.200]   Also very helpful.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.520]   Let's say I want to quote unquote loosen up
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.900]   or move out some potential soreness or soreness
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:40.160]   from a given muscle, like the quadricep.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.720]   Does it make sense to start in the middle of that muscle,
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.560]   the top?
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.020]   Like, can you work above and below the knee?
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.480]   Are all of those things gonna help?
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.320]   I realize this is a much fuller discussion
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.640]   than we can have in a few minutes,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.120]   but like how should I approach it?
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.780]   I'm like, okay, you know, my quads are a little sore,
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.800]   or my back is sore.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.880]   Do I go straight to the back
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.700]   or do I start with another body region?
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.240]   - I don't think it matters.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.080]   What I want interested is inputs and outputs, right?
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.440]   What I'm really interested in is
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.320]   what did you do to make yourself feel better?
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.560]   Did you just hope it would just go away?
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.400]   And then one day it didn't
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.120]   and then you had to activate the emergency medical system.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.360]   So let's define a couple of things.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.960]   What is an injury?
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.720]   This is a great question.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.540]   Injury for us is there's a clear mechanism
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.880]   of mechanical trauma.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.440]   There's a bone sticking out of your leg, Andrew.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.520]   Time to go to the hospital.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.360]   - Injured.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.520]   - Right, you're injured, right?
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.880]   Heard a snap and a pop.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.840]   - Yikes.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.880]   - I have night sweats, dizziness, fever, vomiting, nausea,
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.640]   unaccounted for weight loss, weight gain,
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.520]   changes in my bladder, bowel function,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.720]   problem with coughs, sneezes, or swallows.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.920]   Those are red flags.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.640]   You're not sore, you're sick.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.180]   Let me introduce you to the doctor again, right?
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.080]   If your pain or dysfunction is so bad
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.280]   you can't occupy a role in your family,
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.840]   can't occupy a role in society,
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.440]   can't occupy a role in the team,
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.000]   that's an emergency problem.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.960]   That is a medical condition that needs medical,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.280]   so you come in today, we tweak your back.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.520]   It may need, we need to activate EMS.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.360]   You need to go to the hospital.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.000]   We need to get, because it's so severe,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.760]   you can't do your job.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.040]   Everything else I want to call non-injury.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.560]   I want to be very specific with the language used.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.540]   We call it an incident.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.240]   It actually comes out of this sort of language.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.460]   There was a guy, here's the long way around the barn.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.000]   I read this great book called "Deep Survival"
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.800]   which is Lawrence Gonzales,
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.120]   which is about why people end up in survival situations.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.600]   And it's literally a lot about like,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.120]   we got away with it for a long time.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.040]   And then I just didn't have a, you know,
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.340]   I ended up two miles out sea.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.160]   I've done it a million times, and this time, right?
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.000]   That's it.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.240]   But there was a footnote in there
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.000]   from a book called "Normal Accidents" by Charles Perrow,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.280]   who's recently passed on.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.960]   I emailed Charles 'cause I was like, this has blown my mind.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.260]   He calls, a lot of times we'll have trivial events
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.960]   in non-trivial systems.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.640]   So he's taking systems thinking.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.360]   He's looking at complex system organization.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.640]   And his idea is that an accident, a normal accident,
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.160]   is actually just expression of the system
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.100]   if you gave the system long enough to express itself.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.740]   The inputs and outputs are so tightly coupled
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.400]   that it's difficult to see what causes what
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.760]   and how they influence each other.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.040]   That's the body.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.360]   So your stiff shoulder isn't a problem
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.880]   until you fall on the ice.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.400]   And then that stiff shoulder
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.200]   suddenly can't take overpressure and overhead,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.280]   and you tear your rotator cuff off at high speed.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.840]   You'd say, oh, black swan event, super crazy.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.600]   But that's actually just a normal expression
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.760]   of that shoulder system
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.400]   if we gave it enough time to express itself.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.400]   So he has sort of like incident and accident.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.360]   So an incident is,
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.520]   I want us to start to think about incident-level problems,
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.360]   are pain, loss of range of motion, numbness, tingle.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.840]   We're becoming curious,
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.040]   why is the brain sending me the signals?
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.960]   Pain is a request for change.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.000]   So if we ask our athletic population,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.600]   I just did this with 100 kids.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.760]   I'm like, how many of you are pain-free?
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.560]   100 high school kids, two hands go up.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.480]   - Two, high school. - High school.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.800]   So what we're suddenly realizing
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.100]   is that pain is very much a part of the athletic condition,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.540]   the human experience, certainly the athletic experience.
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.080]   You've been in pain a billion times
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.520]   and still gone out and done the thing.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.240]   So what we wanna do is say,
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.500]   pain is not always a medical problem.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.400]   It's a medical problem when?
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.520]   The rest of the time we're saying,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   how are you using fitness training as a scaffolding
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:35.560]   to understand nutrition, hydration, soft tissue work,
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.400]   desensitization, reperfusion of the tissues?
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.560]   So that's what we're trying to do in sport and training
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.440]   is empower people to say, what's going on with my body?
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.000]   And why don't I feel the way I do?
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.960]   Or why does something hurt?
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.620]   And why can't I remedy that?
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.920]   And then when I run out of ideas, let me go get some help.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   - So the rolling we can think of as a way
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.600]   to move out soreness, prepare us for more work the next day
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.780]   or something like that. - Sure, love that.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.600]   - But is it fair to say that we can also use the roller
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.280]   as a diagnostic tool? - Sure.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.120]   - Like if I'm feeling like an unusual amount of,
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.680]   well, not unusual, but let's just say
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.400]   that I'm feeling like a wuss 'cause when I lie down
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   on that roller and I kinda like slide back and forth,
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.600]   like I've seen the videos of you and other folks doing that,
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.700]   I'm like, man, that really hurts.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.760]   Does that necessarily mean something's wrong?
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.920]   - No. - Okay.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.240]   - No, it means that for whatever reason,
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.600]   those tissues become sensitized
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.120]   and that your brain is interpreting that stiffness
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.360]   as a threat and it's reading it as pain, right?
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.040]   And some people, they don't have that.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.480]   They just, their tissues feel like this,
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.160]   but they don't have pain when they do that,
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.800]   but that's not a normal tissue.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.240]   You should be like layers of warm silk
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.600]   sliding over steel springs.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.280]   And what you're seeing- - Is that what quality tissue
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.160]   should feel like? - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.600]   - Layers of silk over steel springs.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.920]   - Layers of silk over steel springs.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.640]   And what we see is that we are loading
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.320]   and training at such high intensity,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.800]   so such density now that our tissues get stiff.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.200]   I'm just gonna hang stiffness as, for whatever reason,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.600]   high fibrotic, high density of tissues,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.240]   whatever the reason, the tissues don't behave
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   the way the joint system should, right?
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.080]   And that's a problem because my training
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.120]   shouldn't mitigate or attenuate
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.640]   or change my range of motion.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.840]   It can, but now how am I keeping an eye on those changes?
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.360]   Or as you said earlier, as I do a sport
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.000]   and I start to do a sport and specialize,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.040]   I'm throwing, throwing, or I swim, or I kick on one side,
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.720]   how can I start to identify as my body is changing
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.560]   and adapting that sport so I can drag myself back
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.200]   to a sort of a greater readiness?
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.040]   And that's one of the reasons that that mobilization tool
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.440]   is such a powerful tool.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.600]   Again, however you wanna do it.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.320]   I think it's useful for us when we have,
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.240]   I came up with this thing called the D2R2 model
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.320]   because the other ray was taken, R2D2.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.920]   So the first order of business is I wanna desensitize
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.120]   if something hurts.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.080]   Something hurts, let's desensitize it.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.200]   I can do that all different ways.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.760]   Scraping is powerful desensitization.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.680]   Isometrics can be really useful.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.520]   Rolling, BFR can give me desensitization.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.360]   There's so many techniques to make my body--
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.200]   - Blood flow restriction.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.120]   - Yeah, blood flow restriction.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.340]   So that no longer my brain is perceiving this as a threat.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.120]   Because if you're in pain,
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.720]   you cannot generate the same amount of force
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.840]   or wattage or output.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.960]   And your brain is gonna start to truncate.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.320]   It's gonna start to lop off your movement solutions, right?
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.520]   It's just gonna happen.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.640]   So we want everyone to be saying,
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.000]   hey, we don't panic when we have pain.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.680]   We just treat it like another diagnostic tool.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.880]   Then second, D, right, we desensitize.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.240]   And then we ask, is this something that'd be decongested?
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.400]   So decongestion means that oftentimes,
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.280]   tissues that are swollen become more easily sensitized.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.560]   Tissues that are swollen and congested don't heal as fast.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.840]   If you have a swollen ankle,
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.200]   those collagen fibers will not knit together as fast as a,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.160]   right, if you have a joint that's swollen
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.000]   or a tissue that's swollen,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.400]   your brain will shut down force production
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.600]   in and around that joint system.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.360]   Is swelling an emergency?
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.320]   No.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.640]   Is a swollen joint environment really healthy
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.880]   for the integrity and surface of the joint?
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.840]   No, we wanna manage that.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.440]   But oftentimes when someone comes in
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   and the tissue is congested, right,
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.280]   just sometimes we say swelling
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.640]   and we think ankle, right, only capsular.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.200]   But here we have, if you've ever flown on an airplane
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.960]   and had cankles, those, that's congested tissue.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.280]   If we manage that congestion,
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.240]   if we move those lymphatics along,
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.240]   we, muscle contraction drives the lymphatic drainage.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.520]   The lymph system is the sewage system of the body.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.280]   Decongested tissues often express less pain.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.560]   And what we find is that in broken bones
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.880]   or soft tissue injuries,
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.560]   if we can better evacuate that swelling,
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.240]   better evacuate that congestion,
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.000]   not only do we see you're now healing
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.920]   at the rate of a human being,
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.480]   we're not rate limiting the healing,
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.760]   but also we can help you manage that sensitivity.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.520]   Then the third one is,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.840]   can we get some blood flow in there?
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.120]   Like you said, once I warm up, I feel great.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.920]   Welcome to the power of blood flow.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.640]   Tissues become hydrated.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.160]   We're shifting blood from the stomach.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.760]   All the things that happens, right,
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.400]   all that venous return is coming back on board.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.520]   But suddenly we see that
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.400]   if we can get something pumped full of blood,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.720]   it tends to be less painful.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.960]   And that's a really easy.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.640]   So if I have an old orthopedic thing,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.480]   maybe I spend a few minutes just getting a huge quad pump
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.560]   on the leg extension machine, then I go squat heavy.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.600]   Right, so now I have desensitization,
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.000]   decongestion, reperfusion.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.480]   Whatever tool you want to use for these
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.320]   is fair game with me.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.800]   Just how I've come to kind of conceptualize
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800]   these different tools.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.400]   And the last one is restore.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   Do you have full range of motion,
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.760]   full normal in that joint, yes or no?
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.480]   'Cause that's the last thing that we talk about
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.320]   because you're still able to perform your sport at college
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.160]   or do your job,
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.200]   but we're not seeing how in excess,
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.720]   your ability to not excess that range of motion
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.400]   may be limiting your movement choice
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.880]   and potentially overloading a tissue
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.760]   by making it work in a less effective manner.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.280]   Or even just leading to progressively worse
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.480]   and worse posture.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.800]   Sure. Which is probably-
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.160]   Well, define posture for me
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.880]   'cause I think that's a really great place to start, right?
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.400]   Yeah, I can define bad posture
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.920]   as when you catch yourself in a reflection
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.440]   and you realize, well, I'm starting to look more like a C
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.760]   than an R. That's so great.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.840]   The question is, is that a matter of aesthetics or pain?
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.520]   Well, certainly for me, it's not pain,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.120]   but I- It's not becoming injury.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.320]   I noticed that it's not becoming.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.680]   I noticed that unless I pay attention
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   to my posture while sitting,
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.280]   unless I do like bridge my fingers together
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.200]   and pull my chin back a few times a day,
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.640]   that I'm just naturally starting to tip over forward
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   towards my text messages
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.320]   that aren't even in my hands right now.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.760]   And I think this is the younger generation.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.080]   I mean, now that I'm 49, I can talk like that, right?
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:56.920]   I mean, it's striking.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.800]   Were you born in the 1900s?
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.680]   They are- Late 1900s?
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.240]   Yeah, exactly. That's really my age.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.720]   They're starting to look like a-
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.080]   They're shaped like a C.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.640]   That it's- And I'm a big believer in people,
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.160]   especially men, doing neck work.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.960]   I feel like if you especially-
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.840]   How about especially people doing neck work?
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.440]   Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.600]   Anytime- I'm happy to go there with this one,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.960]   maybe even at the risk of being politically incorrect.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.560]   Anytime I've suggested that women also do neck work,
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.480]   they say no.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.760]   You should see my goalie daughter
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.000]   because for every pound stronger your neck is,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.760]   your reduction in concussion risk drops huge, a pound.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.600]   Thank you.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.480]   So we keep the iron neck by the door and she walks in
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.240]   and we have a video in our family
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.440]   where she's doing her iron neck training.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.280]   She looks at me, she's like,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.200]   "Dad, this is why I don't have a boyfriend."
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.200]   Thank you. Sorry, Caroline.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.440]   But that's the way it goes, right?
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.840]   'Cause she's like, "Look at me, I look like an idiot."
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.720]   But she loves having a big, strong neck
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.880]   that can take the shot from the ball.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.720]   Listen, I wish everyone would train their neck.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.960]   I had an accident where I fell off a roof,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.480]   walked away from it, my neck was sore,
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.800]   but I heard it and felt it.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.080]   And I was like, "Oh goodness."
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.480]   But it was actually from skateboarding stuff and falling
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.320]   and then I started training my neck years ago
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.080]   and realized that, wow, when I train my neck,
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.200]   I'm one of the few people in my age cohort
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.520]   that doesn't complain about shoulder pain.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.920]   Now, maybe I don't have full range of motion,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.240]   maybe I'm hanging out with the wrong people,
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.000]   but anytime I see somebody with really broad shoulders
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.760]   where their neck is really inside of their jaw line,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.840]   it looks like a head was placed
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.720]   on the wrong action figure body,
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.600]   I just want to go over to them and say,
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.040]   "Listen, A, it's aesthetically ridiculous.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.320]   "It looks like one of those flip books in the kids
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.320]   "where you can change the head, the body and the legs
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.120]   "to be different animals.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.640]   "More seriously, it's a hazard
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.920]   "because it's your upper spine.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.840]   "It's clearly not in line
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.960]   "with the rest of your strength profile."
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.600]   And the other one is the more incentive-based thing is,
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.160]   "Hey, listen, if you train your neck,
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.480]   "everything else gets stronger
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.320]   "and your brain is going to be safer."
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.200]   And as a neuroscientist,
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.800]   they usually listen to the last piece.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.640]   - Love it, love it.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.400]   - So I'm so glad we're talking about this.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.160]   I do bridges.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.520]   I know that it can be risky.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.680]   With tongue on the roof of my mouth,
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.240]   I do bridges to the back
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.840]   and then I do have a four-way neck machine
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.960]   or I use a plate.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.400]   Jeff Cavalier has got a great video
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.080]   of how to do this that we can link to,
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:08.920]   how to do it safely.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.280]   You gotta close the chain by having a hand on the ground,
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.760]   this kind of thing to do it safely.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.400]   But I've just found that neck work also serves posture.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.720]   Posture serves the ability to make eye contact
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.240]   when you have those things we call conversations
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.840]   with people in real life.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.520]   And I do think these things stack up
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.480]   to we won't call it like psychological confidence,
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.600]   but the ability to meet somebody,
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.440]   like firm handshake,
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.280]   you're not trying to crush the other person's hand.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.120]   Look people in the eye,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.240]   stand up straight, whatever your height.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.080]   These things really matter in subtle ways
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.160]   or not so subtle ways.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.920]   I think that I do feel like, yes,
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.040]   that the younger generation and the older generation,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.480]   that they sort of drop,
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.040]   they kind of drop out of certain elements of life.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.120]   If you're looking down at the ground
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.160]   or your phone all the time,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.560]   you can't look people in the eye.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.840]   You're posturally not right.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.920]   You're in pain.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.640]   You're not as strong as you could be.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.400]   I mean, these things stack up
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.400]   to being like in an aquarium full of fish.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.040]   You're becoming the fish in the background
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.520]   that's like, you know, like it was kind of sickly
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.440]   and the other fish are getting all the good stuff.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.360]   And you know.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.080]   If you define posture as like the Latin word root
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.160]   is position.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.880]   So we're really saying is I have good position,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.720]   I have bad position.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.880]   Who brought, I have bad position.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.720]   One of the ways I think we've lost the narrative
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   a little bit is we try to give people these extrinsic cues
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.080]   to correct their posture.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.720]   Shoulders back and down, check your tent.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.840]   Like, so all of a sudden you're like,
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.400]   when am I going to be a human being?
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   How do I practice this when I'm doing a complex skill?
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.800]   So the organization of your body,
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.440]   the organization of your spine, particularly,
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.360]   really is a reflection of your movement habits,
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.200]   your behaviors, your self-identity.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.080]   There's a lot of things in there, right?
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.680]   You didn't get the job.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.440]   You won the, you got the number from Juliet
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.720]   or you're sleep deprived even.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   - 100%.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.960]   - And I'm going to call myself out
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.800]   'cause people are going to do it.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.360]   There are many times on this podcast
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.280]   when I go and I look at the,
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.440]   'cause I do listen to the podcast,
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.360]   try and see places I can improve, et cetera.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.560]   And I'll be like, wow, my posture.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.960]   I'm like hunched over.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.800]   And I think to myself, and I'll go and I look.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.600]   - You're just reflecting my posture.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.440]   - No, no.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.280]   And I track my sleep.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.680]   So, you know, I'll go back and look.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.400]   I'll be like, yeah, I wasn't sleeping as well those days
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.240]   or whatever it is, right?
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.280]   I mean, I think that we are all guilty
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.160]   of not paying enough attention to our posture.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.240]   So what we can do is we could define posture
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.240]   as there is a median range of the joint positioning
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.320]   where we simultaneously have most access to our physiology,
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.960]   right, and I'll explain that a little more.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.880]   But also those shapes aren't associated
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.640]   with increased pain risk and increased injury risk,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.040]   which is real.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.160]   The research does bear that,
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.400]   that there are positions and shapes
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.640]   that lead to less effective movement
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   and are more likely to experience pain.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.840]   It's probabilistic.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.440]   It's not guaranteed.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.200]   There's more likely.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.800]   So one of the things that I think you could understand
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   is, hey, do you want to have access
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.840]   to all of the machinery?
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.400]   So go ahead and slouch.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.240]   Go ahead with me.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.520]   And then just turn over your shoulder.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.640]   How far can you turn?
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.480]   - Yeah, not very far.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.320]   - Now watch this.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.120]   Get into a position where you take a huge breath.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.160]   Get into the biggest position
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.520]   where you take the biggest breath.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.040]   (inhales)
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.680]   Okay, so that's a pretty rocking shape.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.880]   Now turn your head.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.720]   (groans)
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.560]   It goes further.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.640]   So by you being cued,
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.080]   can you adopt a shape,
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.000]   an organization of your trunk
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.560]   that allows you to ventilate a little bit more effectively?
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.680]   You completely change and reorganize your structure,
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.480]   which led to an improvement in output.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.120]   So when I'm working with people,
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.560]   there's only two things I really can wrap my head around.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.280]   One is, do you have normative range of motion?
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.120]   Yes or no?
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.600]   What are the tools we have to restore that and improve that?
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.840]   And does that expression give us greater biomotor output?
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.240]   'Cause those are objective measures.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.760]   When biomotor output, I mean range of motion,
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.840]   force production, power, right?
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.720]   I see that I can express the physiology in a unique way
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.680]   that makes me more effective.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.240]   And that is why you'll see suddenly we have this definition
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.340]   that is maintaining the physiology and aspects.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.440]   I'm not gonna have as good shoulder flexion
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.200]   with my arm over a head is when I'm sitting up taller
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.440]   or in a position where I can take a bigger breath.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.600]   And I think that's what's really great
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.520]   'cause that gets us away from good posture, bad posture
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.800]   into, hey, that position doesn't serve you as well
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.040]   in these circumstances.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.360]   And in this position,
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.320]   I'm working with the pararescue team in the Air Force.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.480]   The number one reason they were having back injuries
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.560]   was getting the litter out of the helicopter
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.880]   because they have a litter,
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.800]   the soldiers there with all their gear on,
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.760]   they've got a lift from a totally weird flexed position,
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.600]   right?
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.420]   And this just turns out
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.880]   it's not a really effective posture position shape
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.220]   that transfers to handle these higher loads.
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:51.080]   So what do we do?
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   We work on the range of motion.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.680]   We give them skills to try to organize more effectively
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.960]   in that shape.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.800]   And lo and behold, we can reduce injury risk
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.360]   and injury incident in those soldiers, right?
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360]   So what we're always thinking about here
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.160]   is let's get away from good and bad
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.180]   and posture doesn't matter.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.360]   And it also doesn't matter at low load, low speed.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.660]   And I wanna be very clear about that.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.000]   So you can get away with murder
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.880]   at low velocities and low speeds, but speed kills.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.880]   Oh, everyone's fine.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.680]   But when that speed wobble starts to happen,
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.000]   we start to see greater likelihood
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.400]   of deflection from posture.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.320]   Your abs don't work as effectively.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.720]   You can't create the same intra-abdominal pressure, right?
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.700]   Check, check, check, check, check.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.000]   So that's why we always are saying,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.800]   "Hey, is this true that you're saying
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.560]   "under high load, high speed
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.600]   "when there's consequence?"
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.720]   'Cause maybe this set of conditions
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.040]   works under these conditions,
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.800]   but it doesn't work across all conditions.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.360]   And for me, I'm trying to take the best information
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.400]   I have working in sports and performance
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.520]   and trying to transmute that to my family,
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.920]   transmute that to my neighborhood
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.240]   and to the kids I'm working with.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.080]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.540]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.060]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.280]   That means the electrolytes,
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.960]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.400]   all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.720]   Proper hydration is critical
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.820]   for optimal brain and body function.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.480]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.120]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.400]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.080]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.600]   are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body,
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.880]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.280]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.720]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.560]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.180]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.760]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.480]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.960]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.000]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.480]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.200]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.880]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.960]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.840]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.680]   They have a bunch of different
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.520]   great-tasting flavors of Element.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.600]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.840]   Frankly, I love them all.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.160]   And now that we're in the winter months
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.600]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.560]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.880]   I really like the chocolate flavors,
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.800]   especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.280]   So you put it in hot water,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.020]   and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.360]   especially when it's cold and dry outside,
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   when hydration is especially critical.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.720]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.120]   you can go to drinkelement.com/hubermanlab
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.880]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.280]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.460]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/hubermanlab
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.080]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.480]   As long as we're talking about posture,
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.320]   it feels like a good transition point to pelvic floor.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:43.640]   Years ago, and this is a plug for the material
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.240]   that you put out online and in books,
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.540]   but long before we met,
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.640]   I decided to sign up for your Men's Pelvic Floor course.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.400]   - I sold our Women's Pelvic Floor course two to one.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.160]   - It was so interesting because, you know,
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.520]   at that time, one could go online
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.020]   and learn a little bit about pelvic floor.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.800]   Everyone, and we talked about this
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.480]   with a couple of different guests on this podcast,
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:06.120]   including the director of male sexual health.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.000]   He's an MD, PhD, or at least an MD, as I recall,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.260]   Mike Eisenberg at Stanford.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.720]   We've talked about this with Mary Claire Haver
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.440]   and other people in the female health domain.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.920]   - I'm glad we're normalizing this conversation.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.240]   - Yeah, we normalize this conversation.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.320]   You know that the pelvic floor is rich with vasculature
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.880]   for blood flow and neural input for controlling muscles,
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.300]   either passively or actively.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   And I'll tell you, the number of people I know
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.520]   who have urinary issues, sexual dysfunction issues.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.680]   I know because they tell me
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.800]   that they squat heavy in the gym,
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.520]   they do their Kegels and things like that.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.580]   Then I've had guests on like Mike Eisenberg and others,
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.000]   and they say, yeah, actually,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.400]   if you have a tight pelvic floor,
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.500]   doing Kegels is about the worst thing you could ever do
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:56.500]   for urinary function or erection function.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.200]   You know, because you're sending it in the wrong direction.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.080]   You need to learn to relax your pelvic floor.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.960]   Then some women will say,
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.560]   and it seems to be women that report this,
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.440]   whether or not men just have this, but don't report it.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.280]   I don't know.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.880]   I've had people write to me and say,
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.680]   yeah, you know, I'll do some lower body work in the gym
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.680]   and some urine is sneaking out.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.920]   And it's like, well, pelvic floor.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.600]   And you had this great course on pelvic floor
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.300]   that taught me among other things.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.560]   And I will say, I wasn't suffering
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.800]   any of those particular issues,
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.000]   but I had prostate pain in my thirties.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   And I was like, what's going on?
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.560]   Went and got my PSA measured, perfectly normal.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.320]   Thought, what's going on?
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.760]   Started researching online, read your work and realized,
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   oh, I think I might just have tight pelvic floor.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   Started doing certain things,
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.960]   including you taught me how to sit down
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.040]   and stand up correctly in this video.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.680]   It's like, you have to keep your sternum high, right?
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.960]   You sort of, I think you said it was like a stately-
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.880]   - Let me just, there's no wrong way or right way
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.420]   to stand up or sit down, everyone.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:55.960]   But there are ways that reflect increased function,
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.260]   especially when you're in a dysfunctional state.
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.100]   - Right, right.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:23:59.960]   Yeah, right, I don't wanna,
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.600]   we're not trying to yet tell people what to do or not to do.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.380]   But it was like, wow, I'm probably hunched over too much.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.840]   I think my hips are back too far when I'm sitting
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.920]   and maybe I'll move to a standing desk or a sit-stand desk,
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.760]   which is what I did.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.600]   Lo and behold, prostate pain goes away.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.180]   And had I not found that course,
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.620]   I might've gone down the path of medication
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.160]   or something else, took care of everything.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.280]   I also, I will say the other thing I learned
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.360]   was I tend to have a slight anterior pelvic tilt.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.480]   So thinking about the pelvis, like a bowl, as I understand,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.080]   like if that bowl could be,
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.320]   the ridge of that bowl could be parallel to the ground
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.680]   or tilted forward, anterior pelvic tilt,
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.680]   or back, posterior pelvic tilt.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.000]   Neutral seems like a good idea,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.120]   but most people tend to have some natural propensity
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.240]   towards one or the other.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.720]   Started wearing, I pretty much always wore flat shoes.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.980]   Adidas or skateboard shoes are pretty flat.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.820]   I lucked out there.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.660]   - Your shoe game is strong today?
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:52.760]   - My shoe game is strong today.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.960]   Adidas, still wear 'em every day, love 'em.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.800]   Or no shoes, which is great.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.560]   And I noticed, okay, that corrected
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.080]   some of that prostate pain too by making,
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.680]   oh, excuse me, what helped correct it
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.360]   was to make sure that in the gym,
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.880]   I did something that turned out to be glute ham raises
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.480]   that would take my pelvis through
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   a fairly full range of motion from posterior to anterior tilt
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.760]   and I've come to love the glute ham raise.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.960]   We're talking full range glute ham raises
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.440]   as one of the most useful tools
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.840]   just posturally for pelvic floor.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.680]   So it's not about having huge hamstrings.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:31.120]   - Beautiful, addressing stiffness in the system,
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.560]   resetting it, high neurologic component
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.220]   to actually do the thing.
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.720]   One of the things I hinted at earlier
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.040]   is like I've chased biomotor output, right?
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.520]   Intra-abdominal pressure and being able to have
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.640]   a pelvic floor that works for you is part of that system.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.560]   Like, again, we can take the physiology
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.520]   and goose it up and down.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.480]   What's interesting about, I had a famous friend
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.360]   who was filming a TV show and we were working
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.040]   on his internal rotation of his hip.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.360]   So if you imagine someone on your back
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.840]   and I bring your knee to your chest
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.400]   and I swing your foot away from your midline, right?
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.200]   The femur rolls in, that's internal rotation
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.480]   of the femur for everyone.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.400]   And I worked on his internal rotation of his femur
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.260]   and just improved his hip flexion, knee to chest,
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.840]   just got those things going.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.800]   I get this text that night and he's like,
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.320]   "Bro, what is up with my boners?
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.640]   "They're out of control.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.880]   "What is going on?"
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.240]   - Out of control in the positive direction?
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.080]   - Positive.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.120]   And I was like, "Well, there's this thing called blood flow.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.620]   "And when we improve blood flow,
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.720]   "turns out reperfusion is on the list
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.160]   "of things that we chase."
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.480]   - So he'd been crimping the hose, so to speak.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.600]   - It's just stiff, right?
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.560]   And I think when we start to see
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.200]   that endopelvic fascia as a system,
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.360]   it's so easy for us to be reductionist.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.480]   Like, I wouldn't even say you had prostate pain.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.440]   I would say you had pain in your prostate area.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.040]   - Right, and in fact, that's what it was still,
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.780]   the prostate region, right?
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:54.620]   And because-
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:55.860]   - So you're like, "I don't know where my prostate is.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.700]   "Okay, that's pain in my prostate."
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.080]   - Well, I mean, in a general sense,
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.280]   and I also saw that PSA level was well within normal,
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.600]   actually low range.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.420]   And I was like, "What in the world is going on here?"
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.080]   And you start, you can find some pretty scary stuff online
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.660]   about spinal cord injuries and this kind of thing.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.280]   Did what we just talked about,
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.300]   and boom, it's never been an issue again.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.480]   - We have all the Olympic lifting gyms, even our gym,
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.960]   we kept a towel on the platforms
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.360]   so that women particularly would pee themselves
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   when they would receive a heavy clean, heavy snatch.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.160]   And we would just wipe it up.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.680]   - They'd actually urinate on the platform?
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.040]   - Oh yeah, that happens all the time,
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.080]   all over the Olympics, everywhere.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.040]   You'll see that.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.160]   That is bladder incontinence is not normal, right?
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.080]   Totally normal to poop yourself before a fight.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.480]   That's what animals do.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.280]   Totally not normal to pee yourself.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.560]   Peeing yourself is a sign of dysregulation, for sure.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.040]   So what we're, as you're seeing is though,
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.040]   hey, I can't manage this high intra-abdominal pressure
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.200]   I'm creating.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.560]   And what ends up happening is we pee ourselves.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.000]   So we can start by saying,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.700]   well, are there positions and shapes?
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.200]   Theoretically, I want your pelvic floor to work
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.040]   in all the shapes.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.240]   It's maximally, and there'll be some shapes
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.960]   where it just doesn't work as effectively.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.360]   And if you're a man, so we're getting into it.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.460]   If you go pee, you'll see a lot of men
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.040]   will put their hand on the wall
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.120]   and they'll adopt a anterior pelvic tilt to pee.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.520]   And what they'll do is basically
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.080]   just turn the pelvic floor off.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.760]   And so if you stand up and do a big anterior pelvic tilt,
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.520]   your pelvic floor will lose some of its tone
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.040]   and it's easier to initiate a string.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.860]   - So anterior pelvic tilt, again, folks,
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.480]   is imagine your pelvis is a bowl.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.320]   You're tilting it forward
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.720]   like you're gonna pour water out of the bowl,
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.080]   which is a fair analogy here.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.920]   - That's right.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.720]   - You're saying, ideally, they keep a neutral pelvis
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.400]   and use the force of their muscles controlling their bladder.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.240]   - No, no, no.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.440]   I'm saying that it's much more difficult to pee
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.840]   in this position where we have high control
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.960]   over these systems.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.720]   And what you'll see is that most people will adopt a shape
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.360]   where they basically inhibit their pelvic floor
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.160]   so they can pee standing up.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.560]   - I can't believe we're gonna dissect urine posture,
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.520]   urinating posture, but I think it's really important.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.640]   Let's contrast that to the famous sculpture
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   of the boy peeing and he's like leaning back, leaning back.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.480]   - Same posture.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.600]   His pelvis is forward and he's leaning back.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.840]   That's the same posture.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.720]   - So people with sons will know this, right?
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.460]   So, you know, when you're a young kid, young boy,
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.200]   you can like, it almost feels like you can pee
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.120]   over a car if you had to.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   Maybe I tried that.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.440]   - I'm just saying.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.260]   - It was a Volkswagen.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.100]   - One car, one car.
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:34.920]   - Right, right.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.520]   So, but here's, so is there a proper posture for peeing?
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.280]   - No, no, no.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.880]   But initiating a stream, maintaining a stream
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.240]   is like, that's a sign of sexual health,
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.680]   of functional health, it's your general health.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.300]   And what's nice now is notice how we got
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.680]   to this very nuanced conversation
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.600]   about erectile dysfunction, about bladder insufficiency,
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.320]   about, right, peeing ourselves.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.720]   We got there through performance, right?
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.920]   We'll have athletes who literally had a whole bunch
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.760]   of babies, suddenly have difficult time creating
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.960]   high intrapabdominal tone, will jump rope and as soon as,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   and pee, and as soon as they come back
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.560]   to a more organized position that allows them
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.600]   to transfer energy more effectively,
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.400]   recruit better musculature, have better organization,
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.540]   peeing stops.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.380]   So what we suddenly--
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.220]   - This is female athletes?
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:26.680]   - Are women athletes, so you recommend that they jump rope.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.760]   Well, yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.720]   Eventually, I need to challenge that for,
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.560]   that's an easy way to do it.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.880]   But what we see is, can you squeeze your butt
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.040]   and jump at the same time?
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.920]   And what you'll find is that a lot of people,
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.920]   as soon as they adopt this anterior pelvic tilt,
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.040]   glute goes off and they don't have that glute control.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.920]   So that can be problematic for a whole host of features.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.760]   So imagine, I was hoping we were gonna get
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.440]   to hip extension eventually, but you know,
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.840]   what we see is that stiffness in the front of the quads,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.440]   anterior line of the fascia, stiff front of the capsule,
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.480]   whatever the mechanism is, we do a lot of sitting,
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.800]   we're just, we're squatters.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.040]   My inability to take my knee behind my hip,
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.600]   we call this knees behind butt, knees behind butt guy,
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.120]   that's what I wanna be known as.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.200]   Knee, but goes behind your butt like you're in a lunge.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.000]   That's right, sorry, Ben.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.160]   And then what you're gonna see is a lot of times
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.320]   when we put people in those positions,
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.400]   they can't get a good glute squeeze.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.080]   - Okay, could one practice this?
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.000]   I'm thinking about it, it's been a while
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.440]   since I've taken a yoga class.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.600]   - And squeeze your butt, you would be like,
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.200]   I can practice this.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.040]   - Okay, so there's a pose in yoga
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.440]   and I'm not an advanced yogi,
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.440]   but I've taken a few yoga classes in my day
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.920]   where you're on your, you're basically propped up
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.040]   sitting on your knees.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.520]   So it's sort of like in the camel.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.360]   - High kneeling.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.200]   - Yeah, high kneeling.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.040]   And then-
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:40.880]   - Hard to squeeze your butt there, isn't it?
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.000]   - It's hard to squeeze your butt there.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:42.840]   And then-
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:46.680]   - Because of all the forces yanking you anteriorly,
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.920]   those fascia lines, the quads,
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.000]   you're basically in that high kneeling position.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.720]   And because the lower leg is bent behind you,
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.360]   you're being dragged forward
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.000]   and it's difficult to squeeze your butt
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.200]   and extend over backwards.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.080]   - So there's that, do they call it camel pose
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.560]   where you reach back and grab your heels
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.160]   and then you're supposed to look up at the ceiling.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.120]   - That's a gnarly one.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:04.960]   - It's a gnarly one.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.440]   If you do it in the Bay Area, the teacher will say,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.400]   "Don't be surprised if some emotions come up."
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.440]   - No, very fair.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.960]   - If you do this in Austin, Texas,
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.120]   they just say, "It's supposed to hurt, keep going."
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.000]   I'm just joking here.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.160]   This is like regional humor.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.680]   But in any event,
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.960]   I think that's actually accurate by the way.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.720]   But in any event, it is a slightly unusual
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.880]   for most people who aren't accustomed to it
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.000]   to do that pose.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.720]   Again, doing that pose, I bring it up for a reason.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:33.560]   - And if you don't do that pose,
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.520]   you might do kipping pull-ups.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.280]   That's a global extension position.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.640]   All we're doing is taking the spine
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.840]   and putting a huge global load in it
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.480]   instead of a localized load.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.200]   So an anterior pelvic tilt,
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.240]   you might think of localized extension and flexion
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.840]   where I have one or two segments doing the lion's share.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.920]   We, whenever we can prefer
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.080]   to have global flexion extension
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.920]   'cause the spine maintains its integrity
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.120]   a little more effectively.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.800]   - So doing things like wheel pose.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.640]   - Awesome.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.000]   - Putting your hands up near your ears,
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.840]   pushing it flat on the ground,
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   pushing up into an arc shape on the ground.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.680]   - Great diagnostics, awesome.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.840]   - Is this something that most people should be able to do?
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.760]   - Yes.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.120]   Can most people probably do it?
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.160]   No.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.320]   Can we then break down the components of it?
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:23.160]   Even Iyengar, yogi master started to bring in props,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:27.520]   blocks and belts because he was seeing that his students
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.120]   weren't able to achieve some of the base shapes.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.480]   And what they were doing was human Jenga
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.640]   to get into those patterns.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.840]   They were just solving the problem.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   And he was like, hold up, let's not go around the problem.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.280]   Let's support you while we load you
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.960]   and breathe in these positions and shapes.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.240]   - Given that most people don't have a ton of time
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:50.240]   for movement, designated blocks of time for movement.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.040]   If one, we're going to do, let's say some attempt
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.880]   toward wheel pose practice or camel pose practice,
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.280]   or any number of the other things
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.120]   that we're talking about here,
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.200]   which are taking the body into positions
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.640]   that we're not naturally putting it into
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.600]   given our activities.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.360]   - Yeah, great way of saying it, you nailed that.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.400]   - Would you suggest doing these
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.640]   at the end of a resistance training workout?
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.800]   - When does it work for you?
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.160]   At some point you need to be exposed in this position.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.720]   When are you going to get exposed to this position?
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.360]   If it happens to be able to be clumped in
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.680]   with your training, fantastic.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.600]   If it's at home in the evening, fantastic.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.960]   If you've done sun salutation before, it's old school.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.000]   It's almost like they were like,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.960]   let's get this system going a little bit.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.640]   So later on in the day, it's a little bit easier.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:35.640]   So at some point we need to expose you to some positions.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.000]   We have something called the hip spin up.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.400]   And typically for my athletic populations,
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.480]   my teams, especially, I'm like,
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.960]   hey, I want you to do one of three things in the morning.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.400]   You got 10 minutes, that's all I'm asking.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.680]   Eight to 10 minutes.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.040]   Hip spin up, shoulder spin up, or breath spin up.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.480]   Just do one of those.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.880]   If your back hurts or knee hurts, you get hip spin up.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.080]   If your shoulder or neck hurts, you get shoulder spin up.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080]   And then if not, just cycle through those.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.000]   So at least in the morning,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.960]   we're starting to touch some of these crucial shapes
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.320]   that you're never in.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.160]   And if you do the hip spin up and suffer,
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.560]   I'm like, well, that's telling me about
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.200]   your movement history, your injury history,
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.360]   your movement diet.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.800]   And again, nothing that we do on the ready state
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.440]   is related to supernatural levels of range of motion,
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.720]   just basic range of motion.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.040]   The range of motion, again, that everyone learns
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.520]   in med school, everyone learns in physical therapy school.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.080]   So what's fun about what you've said
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.640]   around this pelvic floor health piece
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.080]   is that when we get people doing some mobilization,
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.280]   really brought to my attention of Jill Miller,
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.560]   is that we start mobilizing the endopelvic fascia.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.480]   We just land a ball, just anywhere from your pubic bone
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.640]   to up to your diaphragm process,
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.600]   but particularly belly button south,
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.680]   you'll see that none of that should be uncomfortable.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.840]   And one of the reasons we see high incidence
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:55.160]   of pelvic floor dysfunction,
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.400]   but also high incidence of sports hernias
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.880]   is that we have a hip that doesn't work very well
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.480]   and ends up dragging that pelvis into positions
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.000]   where it's not muscularly very strong, right?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.840]   I can get out of position where I have a lot of good
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.680]   sort of activation or access to those positions.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.360]   Then I have fascia and musculature that's super stiff
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.760]   because every time you do abs,
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.320]   you celebrate the stiffness, right?
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:20.800]   You do abs, you're like, oh, I'm sore today,
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.280]   I'm gonna go have some ice cream.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.120]   When's the last time you managed your hamstrings
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:24.960]   or quads?
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.780]   Probably yesterday.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.120]   When's the last time you rolled out your abs
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.720]   and your obliques?
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.560]   Never?
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.380]   - Previous life.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.320]   - Right, previous life before you respawn.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.880]   So I think one of the things that we're seeing is,
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.120]   again, that'd be a perfect time to do in the evening.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120]   Don't go to the gym and lay on the kettlebell
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.560]   and be a creepy guy.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.920]   Instead, pull out that volleyball at home,
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.920]   pull out that princess ball you got at Walgreens
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.480]   and start having a conversation with your pelvic floor.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.200]   Turns out, you know, your abdomen,
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.520]   your pelvic floor can also be mobilized.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.480]   So we just, it's really simple.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.440]   Front of your pelvis is your pubic bone,
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.320]   that's the front of the pelvic floor,
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.680]   the back is your coccyx,
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.300]   and each ischial tuberosity or sit bones is the side.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.400]   Everything else is your pelvic floor.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.360]   So you can take a ball and just stay away from the holes,
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.120]   and if anything hurts to compression,
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.400]   you found a problem,
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.940]   so you can contract and relax and apply that same tissue.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.400]   - So I might be on my side,
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.560]   I might be rolling with the ball right underneath me.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.880]   - You would just be sitting down on your coffee table
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.320]   and just putting that,
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.280]   sitting that ball in and around your pelvis
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.120]   and around your glutes and around your pelvic floor, right?
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.640]   You might be dangerously close to your grundle,
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.600]   you're welcome.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.080]   So the idea here though is, you know,
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.660]   oftentimes when we'll have athletes with back pain,
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:41.400]   we're not looking at their pelvic floor or hip pain,
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.480]   but you have six short hip rotators, right?
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.480]   You don't just have a couple rotators,
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.660]   you have a huge rotator cuff of the hip,
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.160]   and some of those things are congruent
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.800]   and kind of part of that pelvic floor.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.040]   So it's not that I need to go after my pelvic floor every day
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.860]   'cause again, let me just add another thing to do your list,
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.860]   but if something changes,
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.080]   I suddenly wake up and I don't have an erection.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.520]   I suddenly are discovering that I'm peeing myself
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.960]   'cause I'm an elite cyclist, right?
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.280]   And something's happening that I'm like,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.480]   "Oh, I know what to do here.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.680]   Let me start to work on my belly.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.920]   Let me see if I can work on restoring my positions.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.240]   And can I do a little pelvic floor mobilization?"
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.360]   And that's a great place to start.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.760]   And which doctor was involved? None.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.340]   Which pelvic floor therapist was involved? None.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:22.840]   In fact, if you carry that to your specialist,
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.760]   they're gonna be like, "All right,
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.200]   we get to have the real conversation now
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.920]   'cause you've already done the other stuff."
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:33.000]   - One thing that frightens me and maybe unnecessarily so
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.440]   is when I see men in particular doing crunch work,
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:42.800]   like ab work, crunching with ankles crossed.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.940]   A, because people tend to cross the same ankle
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.000]   over the other one.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.120]   They don't symmetrically switch sides.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.080]   - That's my good side, bro.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.500]   - And my other understanding is that this can also lead
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.000]   to some pelvic floor issues and asymmetries.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.600]   Simple solution could be to not cross the ankles
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.600]   while doing like repeated contraction work of the abdominals.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.640]   Am I being silly?
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.760]   - I would put that lower on the list of problems I have.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.600]   Right?
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.640]   Like, I think if we went into the world right now
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.600]   and looked at people doing curls, curl ups,
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.960]   the real thing is, is that your only way
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.320]   that you're training the abdominals?
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.920]   You know, do I have a bigger range of motion of the trunk?
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.240]   There are so many ways to be thinking about
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.920]   what the trunk should be doing
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.880]   and reducing it down to this one curl.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.240]   I think if one of the things that we're looking at,
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:42.000]   like I'd much rather you hang from a bar and curl up.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.640]   - Yep. So this is pretty much,
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.040]   I won't say the only ab work I do.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.440]   I do some anti-rotation work by staggering my stance
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.100]   when I do curls or anything else,
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.000]   'cause it's a very time-efficient way to do it,
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.580]   making sure my belly button is staying straight.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.640]   So you're resisting the temptation to rock
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.560]   from side to side and you get the anti-rotation work,
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.480]   obviously switching up the stance,
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.720]   but doing what you described,
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.620]   hanging from a bar, doing pikes.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:05.360]   To me, you're also getting grip work.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.200]   - Yes, you're hanging.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.400]   - But just for time efficiency, it just seems like-
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.280]   - You're also not just separating the abs
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.080]   and working with the abdominals with the knee to the chest.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.200]   'Cause that's really what we're seeing is that,
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.440]   do you only need your abs working in this position?
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.400]   So basically you're reproducing another seated position,
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.960]   except you're crunching your chest to your seated knee.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.720]   And that's really what that position is.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.680]   Do we do it long?
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.400]   What happens if you do it long lever?
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.440]   Short lever means the elbow is bent.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.200]   Long lever is the elbow is straight.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.440]   Short lever is the knee is bent.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.320]   Long lever is the leg is straight.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.000]   So why aren't we working in all those patterns and positions?
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   And then being creative.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.320]   There are so many great resources.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.800]   The kids at Dave Durante has a free ab workout.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.920]   He's an Olympic gymnast from Stanford, superstar.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.680]   But you can go on to, I think it's Iron Monkey.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.600]   Sorry guys.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.600]   And what you'll see is there's so much fun way to play
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.000]   and think about what the role of the trunk should do.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.160]   And I think we're moving beyond, thank goodness,
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.840]   this, like I have to be a rigid robot all the time.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.640]   And that we need to ask, what is the trunk supposed to do?
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.040]   A good way of thinking about this.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.120]   And I think your sit up is a good analogy.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.720]   Really a book that makes the rounds from time to time
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:27.120]   is a book called "The Spinal Engine" by Serge Grachovetsky.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.120]   And he really talks about the trunk as a driver of power,
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.160]   not just as a chassis of which the big engine moves.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.880]   And that really is a nice conceptual way
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.000]   of simplifying movement.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.280]   But if we define functional movement,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.320]   most people agree it works in a wave of contraction
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.640]   from trunk to periphery, from core to sleeve,
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.160]   from axillary skeleton to peripheral skeleton.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.080]   But that means, boy, there are positions
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.800]   where I'm really effective and can generate a lot of force
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.640]   and there'll be positions where I can't.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.640]   But if my spine can't handle flexion, it's not a spine.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.960]   If it can't handle extension, it's not a spine.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.040]   If it can't rotate and be into these complex
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.320]   positioning shapes, I'm like red flag.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.200]   So how are you training that thing?
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.480]   And if your only rigid dogma is straight up and down,
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.560]   which is a great reason to do mobility work,
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.560]   is suddenly we can side bend and we can twist.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.720]   And am I exposing myself to some of those shapes?
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.200]   And so we call that work,
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.320]   borrowing from one of my Olympic friends,
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.800]   Stu McMillan, spinal engine work.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:28.560]   Putting PVC, side bending, playing with different shapes.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.720]   And again, if you get into the David Weck ropes,
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.280]   if you threw medicine balls,
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.680]   you would suddenly see you're like, you're right,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.240]   I can't be a rigid piece.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:39.160]   How am I training the functionality of my trunk
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.760]   beyond just my six pack?
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.280]   'Cause straight curling will certainly give you a six pack,
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.400]   but that doesn't necessarily mean
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.160]   you're gonna surf with power,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.160]   run with power, punch with power, et cetera.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.800]   I mean, look at what would just happen with those fights,
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.600]   right, with the women fighting,
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.680]   just the rotational power that they have.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:58.400]   You can't get that from just crunches with your legs.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   - The fight right before the Tyson Jake Paul fight
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.840]   was arguably the best fight
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.920]   and people had seen that a long, long time.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.520]   The spirit of it and just the,
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.400]   I mean, they were just incredible.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.200]   - Everyone watch us women's sports.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.160]   That was really great.
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.360]   So I think what's great now
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.160]   is if we can get people to start to be curious and to play,
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.720]   and I'm not saying you need 10,000 different movements,
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.760]   but instead of just hanging from the bar
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.160]   and doing knees to elbows or toes to bar,
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.880]   what if you brought your right foot to your left hand
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.320]   and you started adding in a rotation to that
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.200]   and suddenly you're like, I suck at this.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.920]   And ultimately what I wanna do
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.200]   is I wanna uncover every deficiency in this play
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.800]   because I'm still gonna deadlift.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.640]   I'm still gonna swing.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.480]   I'm still gonna lunge.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.680]   I'm gonna do all the things that I know
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.440]   that makes me feel robust
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.080]   and makes me ride my bike better and be a better kayaker.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:48.920]   But simultaneously,
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.840]   there's a lot of play on either side of that.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.920]   - I love that you're defining progression
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.280]   as incorporating these novel movements, exploring.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.560]   - Dude, that's Westside 101 with Lou Simmons.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.240]   I mean, like, hey, this week we're squatting with this bar,
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.360]   then we're squatting with this bar,
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.400]   and then we're changing your height,
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.800]   then we're changing your stance.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.920]   I mean, Westside Barbell has been doing this forever.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.840]   - I didn't realize they did that.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.040]   I knew they were like crazy gnarly,
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.000]   like in there all the time. - Every bar has its own max.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.800]   Right, and so what they've done is said,
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:20.440]   hey, the squat pattern is the thing we're training,
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.040]   but how do we put another twist to the pretzel?
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.120]   Now the weight's in front, now the weight's behind,
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.160]   now it's out, and now it's too deep,
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.360]   and now we're box squatting.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.880]   I'm like, wow, you're gonna have to be
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.480]   a really competent, skilled squatter to handle all that.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.000]   - It seems like in so many sports,
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.720]   not just for resistance training,
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.120]   but in so many sports, there's this shift now
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.500]   toward being an ATV, an all-terrain vehicle.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:43.600]   Like, you can't afford to just be good at one thing,
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   you know, and the cool thing about it is that,
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.980]   you know, the more dynamic range that people are expressing,
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:52.400]   the more kind of evolution you see of any kind of sport,
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.920]   and I think we're gonna see this with fitness too.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.000]   I'm realizing this as we have this conversation,
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000]   that what you're really suggesting
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.400]   is that people explore their movement patterns.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.320]   I love this thing that I've heard you say for years,
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:03.140]   and I know McKenzie harps on this too,
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.440]   which is, Brian McKenzie, that is,
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.240]   you should be able to breathe well in every position.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.880]   It's such a fun test, actually.
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.160]   It's such an easy test, you know,
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.440]   squat down like you're gonna get something
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.540]   out of the cupboard, see if you can take
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.380]   like a full belly breath there.
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.200]   - How simple is that?
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.720]   - See if you can get your belly going out
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.760]   on the inhale there.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.800]   I like to do this test myself every once in a while,
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.980]   hanging from the bar, you know, those pikes.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.000]   I don't get very many of them.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.960]   Admittedly, I'm doing like five sets of five.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.780]   - Awesome.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.960]   - Occasionally, we'll try and twist a little bit,
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.320]   and as my grip strength improves slightly,
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.280]   maybe I'll be able to get more.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.120]   Usually, my grip strength goes first.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.740]   - If you had smaller legs, it would be easier.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.400]   (laughing)
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:35.800]   - I'll take that as either a compliment
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.600]   or an insult coming from you, Kelly.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.880]   Kelly's exceedingly strong.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.560]   He deadlifts 600 pounds on the regular.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.400]   He's exceedingly strong, and he has incredible endurance.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.040]   You're actually more of an endurance guy.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.720]   I think this is worth mentioning,
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:49.560]   that you have more--
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.400]   - That's why I'm not very strong.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.000]   - You have more of a, right, but--
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.520]   - Have you seen my strong friends?
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.200]   I'm not deflecting.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.360]   Your physiology is definitely biased towards certain things,
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.600]   like unequivocally, and what I am not good at
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.200]   is being brutally strong.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.440]   Oh, I've been training for 20 plus years.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.520]   Hard training.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.560]   Longer than that, 30 years,
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.040]   and this is all I can deadlift?
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.280]   That's pathetic.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.320]   Have you seen my strong friends?
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.720]   So what you see is that I've been cramming a square peg
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.560]   into a round hole because I really like it,
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.640]   but really, I should be at probably 190 pounds,
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.200]   and I should be an aerobic athlete.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.000]   - Right, like if we threw a 100-pound backpack on you
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.840]   and went backpacking, you'd be fine.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.640]   You'd be like, even now,
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.480]   you're sitting at somewhere like 240, right?
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.160]   You're like 6'2".
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.920]   You can go for days.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.640]   Like you're naturally an endurance athlete.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.480]   - Absolutely.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.320]   - And I think it's worth saying,
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.760]   because if people are listening, Kelly's a big guy.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.160]   - All my training is biased towards,
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.760]   you cannot believe how much conditioning I do.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.800]   I am a disciple of Joel Jameson.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.600]   I'm a huge fan of trying to look
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.160]   at where I'm spending my time
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.560]   in these different heart rate zones,
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.000]   and then I'm just such a nerd of that
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000]   because my primary sport is trying to keep up
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.960]   with my wife on the mountain bike.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.120]   - I think this is really important
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.440]   because I think we've been talking a lot
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.360]   about things kind of adjacent to resistance training.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.520]   I think it's a wonderful shift now in culture
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.720]   that resistance training is being used,
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.520]   done by young people, by older people, women and men.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.520]   It's fantastic.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.360]   This was not the case 10 years ago.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.280]   This was definitely not the case 20 years ago.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.120]   - No, for sure.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.080]   - It was like bodybuilders, football,
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:26.920]   pre-season football players in military
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.080]   were the only people weight training.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.780]   Now it's everywhere.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.000]   But you're naturally an endurance athlete.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.920]   I'm guessing that most people, I'm assuming, is this true,
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.320]   fall into the slower twitch,
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.800]   kind of more endurance propensity than,
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:44.840]   I mean, how many truly naturally strong,
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.360]   fast fiber type people are walking around out there
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.200]   if we just took the general population?
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.640]   - The ones that are are sprinters and super springy.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.480]   - And you know who those people are.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.360]   They're mutants.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:48:00.300]   I think I was always best at a skilled sport
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.280]   that used conditioning or used strength.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.720]   When I compare myself to my friends
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:09.400]   who have huge aerobic engines, it's embarrassing.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.040]   I'm always the weakest, fattest, slowest,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.360]   smallest person in the room.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.540]   If you just want an ego check,
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:17.640]   just come out and hang out with me.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.940]   Just meet my friends, see the people we're working with,
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.200]   and you'll see, you're like, okay, genetics is not the same.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.040]   I think we've told a little bit of a lie
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.240]   in the internet sphere that if you eat this way
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.800]   and you do these, you'll be elite.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.920]   And we can certainly say that you have a training effect,
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.280]   for sure, and you should do that,
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.040]   but that's not the same thing as being a mutant.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.360]   And there are just so many mutants out there.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.620]   Shocking.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.480]   - Yeah, I think it's actually a worthwhile exercise
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.680]   to figure out what one's natural leanings are.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.520]   - And what do you like to do?
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.800]   - Yeah. - How about that?
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:55.800]   I just think it's important that we remind ourselves
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.000]   that the whole point of this is to have the most fun.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.840]   And what you'll see, he put up a video
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.280]   of some Chinese elementary school kids
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.480]   and the Chinese Olympic lifting team coaches
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.520]   coming and assessing their kids.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.200]   And very quickly, they put kids over at squats,
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.600]   they had them jump on a single leg,
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.600]   they had them do double jumps,
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.760]   and they were like, you, you, you,
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.120]   have your parents call me.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:22.000]   Right, so you can already see that coordination matters,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.520]   wiring matters, and they were able to say,
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.340]   hey, these are the things that we think
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.000]   are gonna make good Olympic lifters.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.160]   So those kids, I think we start to split cohort early on,
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.960]   but most important is everyone needs to weightlift, period.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.360]   And it's not light, two pink dumbbells,
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.200]   it's real heavy weightlifting.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.520]   But how much do you need to do to be better at your sport
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.800]   or to minimize your spine?
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.120]   Those are the spine changes or osteopenia or osteoporosis.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:49.560]   Those are great conversations,
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.760]   but not necessarily conversations about performance.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.000]   Right, so it's almost like we need to divide this
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.120]   into like aesthetics, and I'm keeping myself intact,
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.500]   in versus I wanna go to the Olympics.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:04.200]   Because what you're seeing on the world right now
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.800]   is that everyone's an expert.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.820]   I'm like, can I see how you work with 40 athletes?
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:09.080]   Can I see how you periodize that?
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.360]   Can I see how you manage travel and nutrition?
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.480]   Can I see how you were responsible or not responsible
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:16.840]   for this team having all its members?
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.120]   So what we're seeing is that this performance thing
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.360]   is a really big task, and it gets confused
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.440]   and watered down a little bit by everyone fitnesses.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.640]   Well, I squat, so I'm an expert too.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.000]   Not the same.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.420]   Our good friend Kenny Kane taught me something.
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:34.280]   He's shaking his head.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.120]   The best.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.520]   The best, he's a wonderful guy.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.000]   You're not gonna find him on social media
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.040]   because a few years ago he just decided to take his gym
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.880]   and hit himself off social media.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.720]   He's a very, very talented trainer.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.120]   So we're gonna give you his phone number,
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:46.960]   and we're gonna have you call him
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.000]   because you can't DM him.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.040]   Very talented athlete and wonderful person.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.440]   He taught me something, I'd say about eight years ago,
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:59.440]   that I've found oh so useful for my training longevity,
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:03.640]   my enjoyment of training, and it was this, very simple.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.940]   80% of your workouts, Andrew, he said,
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:10.120]   are going to be at 80% of what you could do that day.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.480]   Okay, that involves some humility.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.460]   I like to sweat hard.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.400]   I associate intensity with hard work, et cetera.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:21.720]   He said 10% are going to be at 90% intensity,
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.240]   meaning 100% is the most you could give,
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.640]   possibly in whatever time is allotted on that day,
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.080]   given the sleep, given the nutrition,
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.040]   given the life circumstances on that day.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:30.880]   The readiness for that day.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:33.640]   Right, and then here's where it breaks down
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:34.480]   a little bit more.
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:39.240]   5% are gonna be at 95% and 5% across the year
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.760]   are going to be maximum 100% everything you can give,
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.100]   do or die workouts that day.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.140]   And for me last year, I believe it was,
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:50.100]   was that was the Rock Carry Campaigns is podcast.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.240]   I gave everything I had.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:54.620]   Had, of course, had the mountain been a little bit higher,
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.680]   I'd like to think I would have gone a little bit further,
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.100]   but I gave everything I could
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:00.380]   because that rock was slippery and it was muddy
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:03.220]   and my hamstring was out the day when we started.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:05.060]   You know, I was in pain when we started.
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:10.060]   Anyway, I think that advice that Kenny gave me
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:13.300]   was some of the best advice I've ever heard
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.020]   because my tendency would have been and had been
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:21.020]   to come in and go at 90, 95 or 100% every single workout.
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:23.980]   It got you a long way, that got you a long way.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.940]   Yep, and it also brought me to this place
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:28.140]   where after eight or 10 weeks of training,
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:30.860]   I would get a cold or I'd get some nagging thing,
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:33.060]   a little thing, not, you know, wouldn't put me under,
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:35.780]   but then, or I need to take a week off.
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:36.740]   Normal accident theory.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:39.500]   Right, so I think I'd love your thoughts
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:40.940]   on Kenny's recommendation.
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.460]   For me, it's one of the things that I pass along
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.220]   any time, says, "How about some fitness advice?"
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.380]   I say, "Well, listen, I'm a neuroscientist,
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:47.820]   not a fitness guy, but I know a thing or two
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.220]   based on the mistakes I've made.
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:51.860]   Here's a great piece of advice that's really helped me."
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.300]   80% of your workouts, 80% intensity.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.220]   Another 10% at 90%, then the 95, you know, 5% at 95,
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.860]   and 5% across the year are the all out,
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.900]   everything you can give,
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:04.260]   leave it all on the mat type workouts.
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.300]   We could start with a simple idea.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:09.100]   We say, let's be consistent before we're heroic.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:13.180]   Right, look, I, if your intensity causes you
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.820]   to not be able to show up for the gym for three days,
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.140]   I'm like, sweet, that was sweet.
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:19.020]   And our adaptation response to that is sucky, right?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.780]   I much rather you be getting more consistent
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:23.980]   and not blowing yourself out.
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.540]   Remember that, there was a phase where we were like,
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.820]   "You shouldn't be sore when you leave the gym."
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.820]   Remember that?
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:28.820]   Like, there were people would talk about,
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.380]   "Hey, leave some reps in reserve.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:32.620]   Like, show up the next day, grease the groove.
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:35.220]   That's old Pavel Tsatsalin stuff."
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.820]   I think that's really good advice,
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:40.780]   especially since most people are not 20.
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:42.620]   Most people, and when you're 20,
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.020]   you need to go find out what the limits are,
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.660]   touch the fence, the electric fence once in a while, right?
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.580]   - Lick the, lick this.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:50.660]   - Lick all the doorknobs, let's just call it that way.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.540]   But you know, what ends up happening
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:55.100]   is there's a lot of things have to be in place
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.300]   for you to be able to go to the well that many times.
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:54:01.980]   And what we know now, because we have all of this data,
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:05.020]   is that we can make better progress
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:08.900]   not burning it to the ground every single time.
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:12.860]   And it's difficult for us because if I'm just fitnessing,
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.780]   how do I quantify that, right?
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.900]   It's easy for us to quantify another kilo or another watt.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.580]   That's makes it a lot easier.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:22.620]   And what you'll see is the best practices of these athletes,
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:26.100]   we do spend a lot of 70 to 80% heart rate.
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:27.580]   That's what we call recovery.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.340]   In Joel Jameson language, 80 to 90,
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:33.900]   we're calling that conditioning, 90 and above, overload.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.700]   But what I think is nice is that that gives me a lot of,
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.180]   there's some days where I touch 78 or an 80%
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:43.460]   and it's hard because I am sleep deprived, stressed out.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.660]   My nutrition hasn't been great.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.580]   I'm sleeping in a strange bed, right?
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.180]   You know, traveling, whatever.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:51.580]   So I think what you're seeing is something
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:55.940]   that one of my early coaches talked about, Mike Bergner.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.300]   He says, "When the frying pan's hot, let's cook."
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:00.340]   And that means I need to know myself.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:01.620]   And as a coach, I need to know you.
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.580]   And I'm like, "Andrew, you look great today.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:04.420]   "How do you feel?"
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.580]   "Great, let's go.
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:07.140]   "Let's go chase something, right?"
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:08.980]   And when the frying pan's hot, we cook,
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:10.780]   but the frying pan is not always hot.
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:14.260]   And if you pour in bang energy and jack 3D,
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.700]   you can't even hear inputs and outputs.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:20.780]   So I think that's such solid, reasonable advice.
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.620]   And really what we're looking at is
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:25.140]   how can we get you to train much more consistently
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.660]   longer and longer and longer?
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:28.940]   You can only go to the well a few times.
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:30.420]   And what I'll tell you is that is,
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.620]   I still love to power clean.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:33.500]   It's like my favorite thing.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.060]   And that 100 kilo power clean
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:38.940]   is heavier than it was when I was 40, you know?
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:41.980]   And I want to pretend like that 100 kilo power clean
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:45.380]   is not a problem, but I actually have to progress
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.260]   and get myself there.
[01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:47.100]   And there are days where I'm like,
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:49.660]   "Oh, 80 kilos is my jam today."
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:52.380]   So I think that's really good advice.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.300]   And difficult for us to say,
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.100]   "How are we measuring success in our training?"
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:59.580]   Subjective experience?
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:00.420]   No, no problem.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:02.740]   Let me give you a baby, keep this newborn alive,
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.140]   and then let's go see how hard your training is
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:04.980]   the next day.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:05.980]   You're going to be terrible.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:07.060]   You haven't slept all night.
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.340]   You're stressed, right?
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:12.900]   So I think what's nice is having some objective measurements
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.180]   around, maybe body composition is one of them,
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:16.380]   if that's important to you,
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:19.060]   but are you getting faster over the course of a week?
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:20.220]   What are you testing?
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.980]   How do we know inputs and outputs?
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:23.980]   And right now we're just doing, we're baking a lot.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.820]   We're making a lot of suicides, right?
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.220]   You know, the old fountain drink
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:29.900]   where you just mix all the things.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:32.220]   It's, you know, they always taste the same at the end,
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:33.860]   like crap, but that suicide
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.100]   where you mixed all the fountain drinks
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:37.660]   is a little bit of what we're seeing in that.
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.140]   And one way of protecting ourselves is saying,
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:42.460]   "Hey, let's make sure you can train tomorrow."
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:43.300]   Suicides.
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:45.100]   I was reflecting on that the other day for some reason,
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.340]   why at a wedding or a party, young,
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:49.700]   typically it's a Y-chromosome associated disorder
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:52.180]   to feel like you had to mix a bunch of stuff
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:54.180]   and then get someone to drink it.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.020]   You're not wrong.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.780]   Non-alcoholic drinks for young kids, by the way,
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:59.140]   but mixing all the sodas, putting M&M's in.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:01.140]   Just something like, "Oh, my male friends are weird kids."
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.860]   - And I think that's what we see a little bit.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:08.140]   And if you, I am a deep coach nerd.
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.340]   I love fitness.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:10.180]   I love fitnessing.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:11.900]   I'll jump into any class, any time.
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:14.140]   Like, sure, let's go, let's see.
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:18.860]   You know, it's so fun, but I need to see,
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.540]   I do get to watch sort of trends come and go.
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:22.700]   Things get very hot.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:24.300]   You know, they get very popular.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.660]   And again, fitness has become a hobby.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:28.540]   It's an amuse, and that's okay.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:31.300]   It's totally okay that gym is a hobby,
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.260]   but that doesn't hint about what's the best way
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:37.020]   to develop capacity, elite capacity,
[01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:39.220]   long-term longevity capacity.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:41.380]   Those things almost don't go together.
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.740]   - Let's talk about hip extension.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.060]   - Oh, bless you.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:48.540]   - As somebody who doesn't like the elliptical
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:51.580]   or stationary bike, but loves the assault bike.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:52.660]   I love the assault bike.
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:54.180]   I don't know why.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.900]   Just feels like really good work.
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.220]   - It is hard work.
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:59.020]   But you're not gonna find me on an elliptical.
[01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:00.740]   - Cadian Bill made it harder with the Echo bike.
[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.980]   Thanks for making it worse, Cadian Bill.
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.300]   - But what is the Echo bike?
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:06.340]   - The Rogue Echo bike is even worse than the assault bike.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.420]   - The assault bike, by the way, folks,
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.500]   is the one with the fan.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:11.140]   And I'm not sure if they put, the fan is for resistance,
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:13.580]   not to keep you cool, but it has that effect somewhat.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.580]   - In the winter, you'll know what the fan does.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:20.100]   - So the Echo bike is a harder assault bike?
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.180]   - It's just like, imagine doing it on fire,
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.300]   uphill in the sand with a headwind.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:26.740]   Then you're like, okay, this is,
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.620]   if you can make it worse, it's worse.
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.460]   - If you have one of these,
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:32.140]   I'm gonna swing by this winter break and try this thing.
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:37.140]   - But I love that because high physiology, low skill.
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:38.700]   That's great.
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:40.300]   - You just described me in a nutshell.
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.260]   - I can take anyone, not have to know anything
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:44.340]   about your range of motion.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:46.860]   I can be like, who are you physiologically today?
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:49.380]   Let me introduce this freakish amount of work
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.860]   in this tiny range of motion that's very safe.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:56.620]   So we can really touch high intensities very safely there.
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.300]   - Yeah, I like it much more than the skier.
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.820]   I'll do the skier every once in a while,
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:01.260]   but I find that the skier,
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:04.060]   if I just sit and stand a bunch of times,
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:07.620]   I'd be like, I can just do this for 15 days.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.100]   Like, is this exercise?
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.020]   And I'm like, am I doing this right?
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:10.860]   I don't know.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.780]   For some reason, it doesn't feel like work.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:13.860]   The assault bike always feels like work.
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:15.140]   Always feels like work.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:16.700]   Okay, so hip extension.
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:18.220]   The assault bike is not hip extension.
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:21.020]   Typically, people tend to be hunched forward.
[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:22.460]   You can get upright, right?
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:23.900]   - Still don't have any hip extension.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:24.740]   - No hip extension.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:27.700]   - Let's talk about if I'm squatting and I stand up,
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.860]   I'm extending the hip.
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:30.820]   - As you stand up.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:32.860]   - Right, I'm going from flexion to extension.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:34.540]   - Yeah, one thing that I think for people listening
[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.220]   that at least is helpful for me
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:38.980]   when hearing about squatting is to think about
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.820]   whether or not it's a deadlift or a squat,
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:42.140]   you can imagine taking your hands,
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.260]   putting your fingers at your hips
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:47.700]   and hiding your hands in that joint
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:49.820]   between the femur and your pelvis as you go down, right?
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:53.260]   Your hands get tucked into the fold between the two.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.380]   And as you stand up, it opens.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:56.380]   So it's hip hinge, they typically call it, right?
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.860]   - And I think what we look at the squat
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:00.940]   and the lunge is very, they're cousins.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:03.180]   And the difference is long lever, short lever.
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:05.260]   And typically how you're holding the weight.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:07.220]   That's the only difference.
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.060]   And sometimes upright torso position.
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:13.260]   But ultimately, we're really looking at what's happening
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:16.420]   with the degree of bend of the knee, right?
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.860]   That's why they're such elegant cousins.
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:22.220]   But if I'm squatting down and I stand up,
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:23.300]   people are like, "I'm working on extension.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.220]   "Working on extension all the time.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:26.180]   "I'm like, okay, now let's continue
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:27.540]   "this extension conversation
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.860]   "and bring that knee behind your butt into a lunge."
[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:31.900]   And that's hip extension.
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.940]   And if there's one thing that I'm seeing
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:36.780]   across so many of the populations I work with
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:39.260]   is we're starting to see changes and erosion
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:42.140]   in this fundamental expression of power.
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:45.140]   The only people we don't see it as our Olympic sprinters.
[02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:46.940]   And you'll see that pockets,
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:48.780]   like we work with the all blacks
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:52.220]   and we're obsessed on maintaining the hip extension
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.980]   of these very strong athletes because it means
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:56.180]   that they can run faster on the field.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.020]   Rugby team.
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:00:57.860]   Rugby team.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:03.220]   Am I correct in thinking that hip extension,
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:07.260]   we can think of as a partially reflecting
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:10.060]   hamstring function where the hamstring is responsible
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:11.620]   for bringing the heel up toward the butt,
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:16.140]   but also for bringing the femur back behind the torso.
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.300]   I realize I'm not using the PT language.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:19.140]   No, no, no, I think what's great is-
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:19.980]   By the way, the PT's online.
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:20.820]   I'm sorry, everyone.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:24.340]   The PT community, the PT's, you guys just crack me up.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.300]   In the field of medicine,
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:29.260]   there's an analogous subspecialty of medicine
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:31.300]   where they have the similar kind of like orneriness
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.420]   and it's, being a PT is very competitive.
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.940]   And so there's a, you don't do this, but the PT community,
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:38.060]   it's like, you can make a cart,
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.940]   you can make a whole sitcom about this.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:42.820]   The attacks often range from significant
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:45.220]   to like cluster around petty,
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.900]   not because they're not knowledgeable,
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:50.500]   but because there's so much nuance in this field, right?
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:52.380]   And it seems that there are a few things
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.060]   that everyone agrees on and then everything else,
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.860]   people love to argue in community, out of community.
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.460]   So anytime I say anything about movement of the body,
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.620]   I wanted us to just say,
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:04.340]   I realize I'm probably not using the correct language.
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.180]   Perfect, I'm going to use that same defense
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:10.020]   of petty clusterness, clustering the pettiness.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.740]   I'm sorry, all the physical therapists out there,
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.060]   I haven't represented you
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.500]   in the way that you would like to be represented.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.300]   I'll say, I'm just talking about my own experience.
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:17.780]   It's just differences in nomenclature.
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.940]   Right, and I'm trying to be very meticulous
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:21.780]   in my language today.
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.140]   I appreciate that.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:25.620]   One of the things that we want to look at is,
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:29.500]   and this is a Philip Beach, Muscles Meridians idea,
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:31.340]   is that there are contractile fields.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:32.980]   And this goes along with,
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:35.220]   if we look at Thomas Meyer's anatomy trains
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:38.340]   of seeing the system as a system of systems.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:41.060]   So we start to look at your back and your erectors,
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.100]   and then we tie that into the glutes,
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.580]   and then we tie that into the hamstrings and tie the calf.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:47.740]   It's kind of a whole, almost wraps around the door,
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.380]   the bottom of the foot, right?
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:50.220]   The plantar surface of the foot.
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:54.300]   So suddenly we're looking at this global system
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:58.460]   that's designed to create this mass extension position.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:02.260]   Locomotion, we start to lock some of those pieces down
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:03.100]   a little bit.
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.580]   But one of the things that we've seen
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:08.940]   is that when you aren't competent in this position,
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.940]   your hamstrings, for example, have to do a lot more work
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:15.340]   because your butt is no longer working on hip extension.
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:17.940]   Your adductors are restricted
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:20.740]   and they're not bringing you back into flexion.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:23.180]   So suddenly what we see is that your hamstrings
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:26.780]   are having to do the work of calf, butt.
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.140]   And when your hamstrings are tight all the time,
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:29.580]   you don't have hip extension.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:33.060]   So a simple test we do is called the couch stretch.
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:36.500]   And all you need to do is face a wall,
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:37.660]   then turn away from the wall.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:39.220]   So you're kneeling on the ground,
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:40.940]   hands and knees away from the wall.
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:44.220]   You're gonna put one of your knees in the corner.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.540]   So your foot is going straight up and down.
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:48.260]   The knee is in the corner of the wall.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:49.260]   And then I want you to see
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:50.540]   if you can squeeze your butt in that position.
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:53.140]   Still hands and knees, except one foot now
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.700]   is kind of in the corner, down the wall,
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:57.100]   going towards your butt.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:57.940]   That's position one.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:03:59.340]   And a lot of people are gonna struggle
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:02.060]   with recruiting and activating their butt in that position
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.500]   because it's what I'm calling positionally inhibited.
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.580]   We don't know what the mechanism is.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:10.340]   - So you're getting the knee back behind the torso
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:12.460]   much as one would if you were sprinting
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:14.060]   and the back leg is extended.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:16.020]   - Really we're just flexing the lower leg.
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:18.060]   We're flexing the lower leg shank, right?
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.420]   That lower limb.
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.380]   Second position is to come up into a high kneeling position.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.100]   So you just bring your knee up until like you're kneeling,
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.380]   except that we have a trailing leg now
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.980]   with a leg that's going up the wall.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:31.580]   - So front leg is sort of a right angle, right?
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:33.820]   Your foot on the ground, right angle.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:36.620]   Rear leg is a knee tucked in the corner
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:40.500]   where the floor meets the couch.
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.580]   Foot is up on the couch.
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:43.700]   - Nope, just on the ground.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:44.540]   - Okay.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.380]   And we'll provide a link to an image of this.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.660]   - Yeah, and I called the couch stretch
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.980]   'cause I created this thing a long time ago
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:51.740]   and I created it on the couch for my young athletes
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.380]   while they were watching TV, right?
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:55.740]   I just needed some hip extension exposure.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:58.260]   But we can do it on the wall, we can do it on the couch.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:00.780]   Ultimately, what we try to see is,
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:01.900]   do you have glute squeeze?
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:03.020]   Can you take a breath, right?
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:05.340]   If your breath starts to get real small in this position,
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.180]   I'm like, huh.
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:07.620]   So every time your knee comes behind your body,
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.100]   you can't breathe anymore.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.380]   How's that working for you when you run?
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.380]   Is that good or bad?
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:13.900]   Seems to me that your breath should remain pretty constant
[02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:15.860]   independent of what your hip does.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:18.540]   So then we like to see if people can come
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.020]   to a more upright position.
[02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:21.860]   So that's kind of position three.
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:23.420]   So a little bit more upright torso.
[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:26.380]   We're starting to increase hip demands
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:28.100]   as the torso comes upright.
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:29.340]   Torso's coming upright.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.020]   The knee is moving further away from the chest
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.460]   on that loaded leg.
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:34.180]   And what you'll see is that most people are gonna be like,
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:36.220]   wow, that's real stiff or I can't even get there
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.100]   or I can't breathe there.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:38.980]   I have to banana back to get there.
[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:40.380]   And I certainly can't squeeze my butt there.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:43.540]   And I wanna tell everyone, this is a low level test.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.900]   The real test is your front foot goes up
[02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.820]   on a 12 inch to 18 inch box.
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.540]   So we're not even in the test yet.
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:51.980]   - With front leg extended?
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:54.220]   - No, front leg just up higher.
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:58.380]   So we elevate the front leg into what's called a hip lock.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:01.940]   So that front leg is suddenly taking my pelvis
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.940]   and rotating it posteriorly.
[02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:06.740]   Knee is running into pelvis.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.100]   Pelvis is like tucking.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:09.700]   And now you're really gonna see what's going on
[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:10.540]   with your hip extension.
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:13.180]   - So this is the equivalent position more or less
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:15.860]   of front knee sprinting.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:19.180]   Like really like jutted up in the air,
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:20.500]   maybe even past the belly button,
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:22.020]   definitely past the belly button.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.380]   Rear leg behind you.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:27.420]   So this is sort of like a cotton mid stride.
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:28.260]   - That's right.
[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:31.220]   And so suddenly we have this nice test
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.180]   that allows us to see in our competency there.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.020]   And I wanna remind you,
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:35.340]   if you do the couch stretch and film it,
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.420]   your knee is actually in hip extension.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:39.700]   It's not, your knee isn't even behind your butt here.
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:42.740]   It's that hard and I'm still biasing it towards flexion.
[02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:45.420]   So what we're seeing is that you have a real deficit
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.260]   of hip extension.
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:49.020]   So that's one way to improve it.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.460]   You can just do the test,
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:53.140]   camp out there, take some breaths, contract, relax,
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.820]   breathe, do your resistant isometrics,
[02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:56.140]   whatever you wanna do there.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:59.460]   So many ways to judge that up, rotate, side bend.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:02.020]   The question is,
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:05.460]   how are you now loading that thing in your life?
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.180]   So we can put a band on you
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:08.900]   and get you do some isometric standing,
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.500]   but show me in your movement language in the gym,
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:15.180]   how you're reinforcing hip extension.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:16.780]   So when we were talking about dead lifting
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.100]   with a tandem stance, still not hip extension, right?
[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:23.020]   I'm extending the hip, but that trail leg is not.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.540]   Rear foot elevated split squat.
[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.700]   Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.140]   We start to get there, right?
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:29.780]   Bulgarians flipping a tire.
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.900]   Like anytime where I need to be able to,
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:33.860]   a big lunge is a good example.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:35.380]   Forward lunge, back lunge.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.540]   Tell me about flipping a tire.
[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:37.860]   So you're talking about flipping a tire,
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.860]   but then at the top of the movement,
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:40.980]   you're doing like a kettlebell swing
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.220]   where you buck your hips forward,
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.100]   like you're gonna try and pee over that Volkswagen.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:45.580]   You're pushing over.
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:46.860]   Don't try and pee at the top.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:47.700]   That's right.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:49.380]   But you're talking about bucking the hips forward.
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:50.200]   That's right.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.980]   Suddenly you're upright and that leg,
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:55.140]   that trailing leg is an extension in a long lever position.
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:56.860]   So we spend a lot of programming.
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:00.700]   One of the best persons at this is Franz Bosch.
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:02.420]   I mentioned earlier, and he has something,
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:05.100]   I've termed like the Bosch snatch.
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:08.540]   So if you imagine being in a double stance,
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.860]   so I'm just like, I'm swinging a kettlebell.
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:13.980]   If I took a plate or a dumbbell, doesn't matter.
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:16.340]   I'm just gonna basically go from a hip hinge.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:18.740]   And as I go overhead with the weight of the load,
[02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:20.020]   whatever's appropriate for you,
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:23.900]   I'm gonna take my front foot and step it up on a box.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:27.620]   So all of a sudden I'm going from a flexed position
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:28.460]   in the hip.
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:29.400]   C-shaped body.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.820]   Right, or upright torso, but hinged.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:33.060]   C-shaped, right?
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.220]   Weird C.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:35.620]   And then, Veltica C.
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.580]   And then I'm gonna step forward,
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:38.700]   and now I'm gonna have that,
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:40.980]   one of those legs is gonna be an extension.
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:44.260]   And so suddenly, now we're adding speed to this extension,
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:45.740]   'cause that's not what we do with reverse
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.400]   rear foot elevated split squats.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.620]   We're not loading that in speed.
[02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:52.540]   So we start to add the speed component to what we're doing,
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:54.460]   and suddenly we've discovered another way
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:55.520]   to challenge our movement.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:57.820]   It doesn't just always have to be heavier,
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:59.300]   it can also be faster.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:02.100]   So I'm basically, if you imagine if I was,
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:02.960]   here's a great example.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.800]   I love pressing.
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.620]   I think overhead pressing is the bee's knees.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:06.900]   It's one of my non-negotiables.
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:07.880]   We're gonna press.
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:10.580]   Seesaw press, overhead press, we're pressing.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:14.340]   But, if I take your front foot and put it up on a box,
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.640]   make sure that back foot is straight
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.560]   with all your toes on the ground,
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.220]   and press from that position,
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:20.780]   you're gonna find out why you don't have any hip extension.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:23.040]   It's gonna be so, you won't even think about the weight,
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.100]   you'll think about your groin exploding.
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:25.940]   So a lot of what--
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:27.780]   Do you recommend people probe that?
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.380]   Oh, yes, absolutely. Those mechanics?
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:30.800]   With very light dumbbells at first.
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:31.640]   No, go press.
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:33.180]   Go find out how well you can press overhead,
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:34.380]   and you're gonna see that, like, wow,
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:37.420]   this tandem stance front foot elevated press
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.380]   is gonna kill you.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:42.180]   Can, there's a movement I do, I'm guessing,
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:45.220]   well, I'm curious if it activates hip extension
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:46.740]   the way I think it does.
[02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:48.860]   Here's what I've been doing that I've found useful.
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:50.900]   I don't know if it's true or not.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.940]   But what I'll do is I'll tie a fairly thick band
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:53.980]   to a pull-up bar.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.100]   I'll squat down, I'll hold it,
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.980]   like I'm holding like a pole in front of me,
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:02.640]   like a pole carrier in a parade or something.
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:05.300]   I'll squat down and I'll jump up,
[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:09.900]   but instead of, but I'll buck my hips forward at the top.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:11.820]   So like feet go out in front.
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:14.660]   It's very unnatural movement, actually,
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.660]   as opposed to jumping and putting my toes down,
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:18.900]   pointing my toes down, my toes are kicking forward.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:21.140]   So I'm trying to mimic the top of a kettlebell swing
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:22.420]   at the top of this movement.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:24.380]   I would say, you know, one of the things
[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:27.380]   that is useful for me as I am asked
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:29.100]   to come and tear through people's programming
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:32.780]   and look for holes in their movement practices,
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:36.500]   we look at fundamental shapes.
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:40.260]   So what's nice is that, okay, hang on, everyone.
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:43.060]   Let me define exercise for you.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:46.160]   Let me just, I'll just give you a little framework.
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.340]   And I'll start by saying, if something inflammatory,
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:49.900]   the shoulder's not that complicated.
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:51.300]   It doesn't do that many things.
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.860]   It goes overhead, it goes out to the side,
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:56.100]   goes in the front, it goes in the back.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.540]   That's what your shoulder does.
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:00.600]   You can bend the elbow, you can twist in all those shapes,
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.820]   but those are the four fundamental primary organizations
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:05.980]   of the shape of the shoulder.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:09.580]   Hip has flexion, extension, right?
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:11.220]   Really, I could go laterally,
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.740]   but that's just a different kind of squat.
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:16.580]   But really, like, am I squatting with the foot really narrow
[02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:18.740]   or am I squatting a little bit wider?
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.260]   So what we can then do is say,
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:23.780]   in these fundamental bookends, these benchmarks,
[02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:25.540]   this is what we call archetype.
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:26.660]   Suddenly I can ask, well,
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:29.940]   how are you loading your overhead position?
[02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:32.620]   So if you're always pressing on a bar
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:34.100]   or pulling on a laptop machine,
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:36.500]   you actually are overhead,
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:39.620]   but you're not in the fullest expression of overhead, right?
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.340]   Which is your arms straight up and down,
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:43.300]   parallel by your ears.
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.580]   - Hands over the top of your head.
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:46.020]   - Stams over your head, right?
[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:47.560]   So what we can then do is say,
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.460]   well, what tools do you like to use?
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:50.380]   Kettlebells, great.
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.180]   That's one of the reasons kettlebells are so great.
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:54.420]   Single arm, I can't hold it out here, it's gonna fall.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:56.460]   I have to finish over my head, right?
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:58.460]   Dumbbell's the same, but the kettlebell is a saw,
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:02.460]   it constrains us to express full overhead motion.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.540]   I can look at, do you have enough interrotation
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.980]   with the hand by the side?
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:08.460]   Are you doing enough pressing-like activities?
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:11.780]   Chaturanga, the finished position of my row, right?
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:13.420]   Bench press, dip, running.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.540]   Those are all movements
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:17.240]   where my shoulder comes into extension,
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:19.020]   whether the arm is straight or bent.
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.440]   So what's nice now is I can say,
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.380]   well, am I distracting those tissues
[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:24.160]   or compressing those tissues?
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:25.380]   Well, you're like, well, what do you mean?
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.140]   I'm like, are you pressing or are you doing a pull-up, right?
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.560]   Pressing overhead or doing a pull-up.
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.660]   That's compressing or distraction, right?
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:34.980]   Very simple ways of looking at these movements.
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.700]   We can say, well, how are you coming there?
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.700]   Did you get there from a snatch
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:40.580]   or did you get there from a front rack position?
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:42.340]   So we can look at start position, finish position.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.900]   And suddenly what you're realizing is you're like,
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:46.340]   oh, I'm starting to understand the root movements
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:49.200]   and root positions that help me improve performance,
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:53.420]   predict future performance, and help me get through pain.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:55.980]   Because if I have people not expressing
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:58.320]   the highest levels of expression of the movement,
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:12:59.340]   that's something we can improve.
[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:00.600]   That's a technique, right?
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:02.220]   It's not just get bigger and stronger.
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:04.320]   It's, hey, let's be more technically proficient.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.780]   So I have all of these ways
[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:08.700]   of looking at the movement selection choices.
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:10.500]   Again, what are you comfortable with?
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.300]   But then I can challenge it with load, make it heavier.
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:14.620]   We can do volume.
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:15.940]   We could add speed.
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:18.160]   We could add cardiorespiratory demand.
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:20.420]   You could do more than five and suddenly you have to do 20
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:21.920]   and we have metabolic demand in there.
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:24.540]   You and I are competing all of a sudden, right?
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:28.240]   Now, suddenly I go from open torque to close torque.
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:30.940]   I go from giving you a barbell to a dumbbell, right?
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:33.140]   I go from open chain to close chain.
[02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:35.060]   Suddenly we're like, holy moly,
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.860]   block practice, random practice.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:41.500]   I have all the tools for me to understand,
[02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:43.180]   are you competent putting your arms over your head
[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:45.100]   or are you exposing these shapes
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:46.340]   under these different domains?
[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:49.000]   And I think when we only look at
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.080]   sort of a few ranges of motion
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.400]   and we only look at load as the way,
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.940]   then we lose all the opportunity
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:56.200]   and richness of programming.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:57.040]   - Got it.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.720]   Well, let me come back to my silly example
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.640]   of the band and the jump thing and say,
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:04.960]   okay, so for getting better hip extension,
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.680]   which is what I think a lot of people need
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:07.520]   is what I'm hearing.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:08.640]   A lot of people are in hip flexion.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.440]   - So you're jumping and then coming up.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.120]   - Yeah, I mean, or, you know,
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.360]   we've seen these beautiful images of certainly not me,
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.040]   but like people doing long jump
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:18.220]   where they're kind of like in an arched position,
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:19.060]   something.
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:19.880]   - Oh, I see what you're saying.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:20.860]   - Yeah, so the idea is,
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:22.580]   because with the band it's safe, right?
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:25.860]   You know, trying to get the hip into extension
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:28.040]   or feet out in front of the jumping.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.960]   - It's a kipping pull-up without a pull-up.
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:31.200]   You're just kipping on the bar.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.440]   - And I don't kip on my pull-ups by the way.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:34.320]   Because I'm a time under,
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.960]   no, I don't kip on my pull-ups.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.940]   I train with Ben Bruno from time to time.
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:41.520]   You kip on a pull-up with Ben Bruno there,
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.220]   you're never gonna hear the end of it, ever.
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:45.540]   So I don't, but I don't anyway,
[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:48.000]   'cause I'm a time under tension guy.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:48.840]   - That's fine.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:50.200]   I'm gonna say that I love strict pull-ups.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.240]   I do more strict pull-ups than you can imagine,
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:54.240]   but if you can't kip, there's something wrong with you.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.160]   - Okay, got it.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.660]   We'll argue about this more offline.
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:00.120]   But I love to sprint.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:02.040]   So that's hip extension.
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:02.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.000]   - Love to sprint. - You can be.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.600]   - Love to sprint.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.640]   And I love jumping.
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.360]   Like I'm a big believer in this maybe true,
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:13.400]   maybe not true idea that as we get older,
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:14.680]   we tend to jump and land less.
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.680]   A lot of injuries come from lack of eccentric load.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.180]   - There's an old saying out of the Soviet system,
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:22.640]   when you stop jumping, you start dying.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:23.680]   - I believe that.
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:26.520]   - And the lowest form could be trampolining.
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:29.340]   The highest, another low form, jump roping.
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:32.100]   Highest form, starting to be really powerful.
[02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:33.380]   I love it.
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:34.300]   You're killing it.
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:37.900]   And what's great now is you just made the switch.
[02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:41.420]   We started describing your training in blocks of positions.
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:43.220]   What position am I training?
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:45.420]   What shape am I reinforcing?
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:48.220]   Right, that's a really not, it's not a muscle.
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:52.100]   Remember your muscles are not wired for movement.
[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:53.900]   Your brain is wired for movement, right?
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:55.580]   You can't, you don't have any selective control
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:56.660]   over a single muscle in your body.
[02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:57.820]   That's a mistake.
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:59.300]   So you're not really working your biceps.
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:02.300]   You're working arm flexion, right?
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:03.660]   In a variety of positions.
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:06.660]   This squat exercise biases my quads more,
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:09.100]   but I'm not actually quadding, right?
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.140]   'Cause that's impossible.
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:12.660]   - Yeah, I think that the misconception,
[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:16.420]   the broad misconception is that resistance training
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:18.380]   is just to build and strengthen muscles
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.980]   in a bodybuilding kind of fashion.
[02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:21.660]   And no disrespect to the bodybuilders, but--
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:22.500]   - No, we learned a lot.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.220]   - But we learned a ton and yet most people
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:28.460]   would probably do well to think about functional movements.
[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:30.340]   In fact, there are a few Instagram accounts
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.480]   that really like to come after, not just me,
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:35.300]   but a lot of people that have talked
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:36.140]   about resistance training
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:37.980]   and all that talk about functional patterns.
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:41.620]   And I have to say, as much as the messaging sometimes,
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:43.340]   I think is a little bit abrasive,
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.020]   I pay attention to these and I have seen
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.740]   some of the before and afters that they'll show
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:49.140]   for people that will incorporate into their training
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:53.060]   like throwing or ballistic movements
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:55.700]   from fully stop sprinting out the gate kind of thing
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:58.980]   and focusing immensely on balancing
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:00.020]   the two sides of the body.
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.780]   And without ever having done those programs,
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:03.900]   I have to say like, yeah, like a lot of these people
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.900]   had some pretty dysfunctional patterns
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:07.560]   and they look like they're doing better.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.420]   And I think it's because I have to assume
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:15.340]   that they're incorporating a much broader range
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:19.420]   of movements, more hip extension,
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:20.540]   working the two sides of the body,
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.260]   all the things that you're talking about,
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.540]   all the things that you're talking about.
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:25.800]   And so I think that the bodybuilding piece,
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:27.840]   I think is a great thing for getting people out the gate.
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:29.940]   I always say the amazing thing about resistance training,
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:30.940]   forgive me for going long here,
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.340]   but I think this is something that
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.160]   if somebody is not naturally inclined to exercise
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.020]   or resistance training,
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:39.920]   resistance training is one of the few forms of exercise
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:42.660]   that because of the blood flow, the so-called pump,
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:47.660]   give people a visual and sensation-based window
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.580]   into the progress they might make.
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:50.420]   - Hell yeah.
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:52.000]   - Right, I mean, this is unlike going for a run
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.900]   and getting to like, at the end of your run,
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:55.180]   you see a little less body fat
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:56.020]   and then two days later,
[02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:58.140]   you've reduced your body fat percentage, right?
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.980]   Like it gives you a window into your future
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:01.580]   when you resistance train that way.
[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:05.340]   - And a gateway into a conversation that's very complex.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:07.180]   This is all I think about.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:08.940]   And people are like, hey, I just want to feel better
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:10.840]   and I don't want to get hurt in my calves when I run.
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.480]   You're like, okay, it can be really simple.
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:14.920]   And also you have a right to look jacked and tan.
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:16.560]   I mean, you can be jacked all you want.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:18.840]   - Mark Bell makes this point every single post.
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:22.320]   - Look, I think there's something that I try,
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:23.880]   we don't ever punch down.
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:26.800]   We just don't, you know, we point to what we do.
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.160]   This is our model.
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.660]   But any model that someone's on the internet,
[02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:32.440]   a model has to do three things.
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:35.520]   It has to explain current phenomenon, right?
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.680]   It has to predict future phenomenon
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:39.960]   and it has to be easily communicated.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.480]   So let me see your model, how it works.
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.560]   How does it explain, if I do your thing,
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:47.880]   will I get better at this thing, right?
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.880]   That's the thing I'm interested in, right?
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.240]   So what I see is, oh, a lot of recursive fun fitness
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.580]   where people feel better,
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:57.320]   but I still have to go over here and squat
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.920]   or I still have to go over here and become conditioned.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.520]   But you can see the truth of needing to expose people
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.160]   to bigger ranges of motion and more skilled movement
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:11.520]   than some of the things we're getting traditionally
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:13.300]   in the gym, right?
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:15.720]   And I think one of the things that we saw
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.800]   with like a pivot towards movement culture, right?
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.960]   Kind of coined by Ido Portal is that what we were seeing
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:27.900]   is that the gym didn't get necessarily better movers.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:31.720]   What we had was people originally doing a skill,
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:33.880]   throwing something, running track and field.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:36.040]   We would train and then go do more of that.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:38.840]   And then what we did is we took the gym
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.720]   or took the sports skill movement out of it
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:44.280]   and we just remained in the gym.
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:46.200]   And you can see the reaction to that as well.
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:47.520]   You're not very elegant.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:49.620]   You can't, don't have any moving solutions.
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:51.680]   You don't transfer your energy very well.
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.800]   You're not, you know, you're not graceful.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.840]   You can't, you have no rhythm.
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:58.540]   So the real key for us is like,
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.260]   I think we wanna put playback in there
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.480]   and you can see what the reaction is to,
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:05.520]   hey, if we're just doing bench press and hack squats,
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:09.720]   maybe that's not making the best mover,
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:11.520]   but it's certainly making a jacked guy who's,
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:14.240]   what we call it, what is it in that movie, "Hot Girl Fit"?
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.600]   Where, you know, it's one of the recent movies
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:20.000]   where the guy is, who's the guy from "Twisters,"
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.560]   that incredible actor he was in, Top Gun.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:24.720]   Anyway, he's swimming and the girl is like,
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:26.080]   "Hey, why are you out of breath?"
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:27.520]   He's like, "I don't do cardio.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.680]   "I just do abs and biceps."
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:30.500]   She's like, "Oh my God, you're hot girl fit.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:35.360]   "Like you have this big engine that looks good with no-go."
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:36.680]   And I wanna make sure that,
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:38.440]   no offense to all the hot girls out there,
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:39.860]   but the idea here is,
[02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:41.880]   what is it you wanna do with your body?
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:45.560]   Let's start there and then we can start to say,
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:46.840]   well, what do you have access to?
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.560]   What's your training age?
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.960]   And it's a nuanced conversation.
[02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:51.560]   It's probably why you should have a coach
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.160]   and develop a coach for the rest of your life.
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:57.760]   But let's not pretend having abs and big biceps
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:00.660]   is gonna make you a good MMA fighter, right?
[02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:02.140]   And you can see why the resistance of,
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:04.220]   "Hey, that made me less athletic."
[02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:05.860]   We wanna be careful of that.
[02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:09.980]   Yeah, I like using the resistance training
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:12.740]   to make me stronger and better at running.
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:13.580]   Yes.
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:16.500]   And that's what's in my mind.
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:17.340]   Yes.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:19.220]   I only ran cross country one season in high school.
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:21.220]   It wasn't very good, but really enjoyed it.
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.540]   But I love running.
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.980]   I've been running for a long time and I'll never be a-
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:27.020]   I ran cross country one year in high school.
[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.400]   Maybe we ran against each other.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.600]   Oh no, you're a year older than I am.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:32.080]   So I wanna, yeah, well,
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:33.260]   I'll tell the story some other time.
[02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:35.860]   It's not, my stories aren't relevant here,
[02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:40.040]   but I use resistance training to be able to run better,
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:43.020]   faster, further without pain for me.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:47.300]   That is what I would hope we look at training for.
[02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:51.740]   Now apply a longevity lens, a durability lens, right?
[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:54.560]   Or as Juliette says, she's like,
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.400]   don't you wanna just be able to pop off the couch
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:58.360]   and go on adventures, right?
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:00.680]   I wanna have a body that's capable of that.
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.160]   I think what we've been pitching in the gym
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:04.480]   doesn't really do that.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:06.080]   And even that, I just want everyone to hear
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:07.800]   and double click on what Andrew just said.
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:09.680]   That framework is that I now have
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.800]   a third party objective measure.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:15.240]   Does my running get better with my training?
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:18.080]   And it's a really great way to evaluate your training.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:18.920]   Am I faster?
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:19.740]   Do I feel better?
[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:20.580]   It's really worked for me.
[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:25.280]   And it keeps me out of any kind of gravitational pull
[02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:26.960]   toward just trying to get more weight
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:28.160]   on the hack squat machine,
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:30.640]   which I enjoy progressive overload.
[02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:33.280]   I enjoy doing movements better with more weight, et cetera.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:37.200]   But I find that the gym just becomes this,
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:41.080]   when it's a closed loop,
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:43.440]   I find that it just becomes this kind of like
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.960]   endless exploration of like, what am I really?
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:47.920]   Also at this age, like I wanna maintain strength
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:49.880]   and build some muscle perhaps, but mostly-
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:50.800]   - Do you wanna get heavier?
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:51.640]   - I don't.
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:52.460]   - Isn't that weird?
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:53.300]   - I don't know.
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:55.340]   - You need as much muscle as you can
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:56.560]   because winter is coming.
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:59.300]   - My goal is to actually get much stronger
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:02.520]   without getting bigger and to keep my endurance going.
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.500]   I like to do one long rucker run per week
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:07.500]   at one shorter run, one sprint type run.
[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:08.420]   I just figure like I'll be-
[02:23:08.420 --> 02:23:12.000]   - Everyone, what you just described for a typical person
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.460]   is doing a long piece, a short piece
[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:16.780]   and a high intensity piece.
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:17.820]   That's right.
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:20.020]   That is really, that's the crack.
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:21.060]   - Yeah, that's what I do every week.
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.540]   If I'm, you know, most weeks and then I'll lift,
[02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:25.140]   you know, legs one day, you know, torso.
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:26.100]   Everyone laughs, torso.
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:26.920]   What kind of thing is that?
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:28.420]   You know, torso, including neck and abs.
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:29.260]   - Let's take it to the next level.
[02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:30.100]   Let's go flank too.
[02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:30.940]   You wanna get torso on flank.
[02:23:30.940 --> 02:23:33.020]   I'm really confused if I work on my flank.
[02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:36.340]   - And then I'll do what could be called distal muscles.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:39.020]   I'll do an extra workout for calves, biceps and triceps
[02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:41.100]   and forearms and grip strength on Saturday.
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.560]   And that combination of things, right?
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:44.540]   This isn't about my training.
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:46.540]   To me, meets the demands of life.
[02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:49.820]   Like I can sprint for the airplane with my luggage
[02:23:50.660 --> 02:23:53.260]   and get there and not cough up both lungs.
[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:54.860]   I can go backpacking.
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:56.300]   Like if you say, hey, let's go backpacking
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:57.460]   or go Grand Canyon. - You can do that.
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:59.540]   - Tomorrow, you're gonna carry 75 pounds sack.
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:00.380]   - What a great test.
[02:24:00.380 --> 02:24:02.060]   - I'll be a little bit sore at night, but it'll feel good.
[02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:03.460]   I'll feel good sore, right?
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:07.980]   We can go to the gym together and I can put, you know,
[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:09.820]   what feels to me like a respectable amount of weight
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.060]   on the hack squat.
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:12.780]   We do some full range glute ham raises.
[02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:13.740]   I can hang from a bar,
[02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:16.180]   but I'm not trying to beat a pull-up record
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.880]   or run a marathon.
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:20.260]   I find that anytime I've gone to the extreme
[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:23.540]   in any one kind of training, I end up injured, sick,
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.380]   and I'm just not interested in that.
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:26.780]   And I like to think, I could be wrong,
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:27.820]   I'm projecting here probably,
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:30.300]   that I'm representative of what most people want.
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.260]   I also wanna be able to overeat a little bit
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:33.100]   every now and again.
[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:34.700]   Like Thanksgiving's coming, a little bit.
[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:37.460]   I also wanna be able to not have to eat all day
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:38.380]   and then eat a big dinner
[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:40.820]   and not dissolve into a puddle of my own tears
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:42.140]   because I'm neurotically worried
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.820]   about something nutrition-based.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.900]   Like I tend to, I basically skip one meal a day
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:47.420]   just by virtue of my schedule.
[02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:49.980]   It's like non-intentional intermittent fasting.
[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:52.680]   And the people who are obsessive about protein will say,
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:53.740]   well, gosh, that isn't as good.
[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:55.980]   But yeah, okay, so maybe I get a little bit less muscle.
[02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:57.980]   I'm not doing, I don't wanna be so neurotic
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:59.500]   about my training that I'm not focusing
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:01.340]   on the bigger missions of my life.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:05.180]   - And notice that what you said was,
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:08.060]   I train so I can have fun.
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:10.420]   And I just wanna double-click on,
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:14.760]   we have sucked the joy and the play and exposure
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.040]   out of training and out of fitness.
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.260]   And now it's, I have to have this VO2 max
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:22.420]   so I'll live to 150 and I have to do, right?
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:25.580]   And you forgot that we, this whole thing
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.540]   is so you can go spend some credits.
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:30.980]   So I like to say the gym and all that really focused training
[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:32.660]   is spending time on credits.
[02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:34.260]   But one of my coach friends,
[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:36.820]   Nicole Christensen says, CrossFit Roots,
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:38.960]   she's like, we don't nature for time.
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.460]   Stop naturing for time.
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:43.140]   Like this, we're surfing so we can surf all day
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:45.480]   and we can surf more waves than the other kids
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:47.220]   'cause you're not fit enough, right?
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:49.180]   I wanna go hike and then ride my bike
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.940]   and play and ski and do all the things
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:51.900]   I wanna do with my body.
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:54.240]   And that made me wanna hold my kids
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:57.660]   or I wanna do my job in this warehouse.
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:25:59.460]   We're starting to train for life
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:01.060]   in a little bit more simple way
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:03.620]   and it doesn't feel like this crazy burden.
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:07.060]   And it also happens to be the best tool
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:09.440]   to understand how you're moving.
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:11.980]   Because my expert coaches can watch you run
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:13.580]   and be like, oh, that's what we're working on.
[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:15.700]   And I'll go right to the thing, right?
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.980]   But for the rest of us, we need to say,
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:19.660]   wow, my shoulder, that bench,
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:22.240]   that fly dumbbell bench was a little bit tricky.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.540]   I'm losing some shoulder extension, right?
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:26.900]   Or at least I'm touching these shapes.
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:29.860]   And that ends up being a really interesting diagnostic tool
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:32.920]   where we can really take a shot at improving function
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:35.340]   and reducing musculoskeletal distress.
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:38.100]   And I think this is the template for it.
[02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:39.540]   - Yeah, enjoying your training
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.900]   and including enjoying training hard
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:43.700]   is one of the best things one can do.
[02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:44.860]   Years ago when I was skateboarding,
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:46.980]   I mean, I ruined skateboarding for myself
[02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:50.020]   because got picked up out of sympathy, to be fair,
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:51.140]   by a couple of sponsors.
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:53.540]   And then got obsessed with the fact that, you know,
[02:26:53.540 --> 02:26:55.140]   I wasn't progressing, then broke my foot.
[02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:57.280]   And, you know, pretty soon I didn't hate it.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:58.620]   I loved it and I loved the community,
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:00.680]   but it turned into something else.
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:03.060]   And had I just taken a step back from it and said,
[02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:05.420]   all right, I'm decent at this, I could get better.
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:07.340]   And I'm just gonna focus on doing it for pleasure
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:09.700]   and make a living some other way.
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:11.740]   I'd probably be doing, you know,
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:13.980]   like, you know, front side inverts and pulls now.
[02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:15.340]   And unfortunately I'm not.
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:17.900]   I'm lucky if I get a nice little front side grind on coping.
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:21.140]   But whereas with fitness, resistance training, running,
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:23.200]   I love resistance training and running.
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.660]   The cup of coffee before my workout
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:26.860]   takes 10 times better because I'm gonna work out.
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:29.580]   I love to use it as an opportunity to listen to music,
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:30.780]   listen to podcasts.
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:32.560]   Like there's so much that's in and around it
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:34.180]   that's still just pure pleasure.
[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:36.780]   Even on the days when I'm like at 95% of output
[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:39.540]   or 100% of output or 80% of output.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:41.700]   I'm like, I just, I'm having so much fun.
[02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:42.540]   - That's right.
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:44.900]   - And I can't wait to get back in there.
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:49.420]   - So when we're, we are looking at society health, right?
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.180]   The first thing we argue,
[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:53.900]   instead of saying what's most important,
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:55.620]   we say, what is it you wanna do?
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:57.420]   And who are your friends are gonna do it with?
[02:27:57.420 --> 02:27:58.980]   And are you gonna do it a lot?
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:27:59.900]   Let's start there.
[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:02.460]   Then we can start to weasel in everything,
[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:04.680]   especially with social isolation,
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:06.260]   with sort of lack of community.
[02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:08.840]   I mean, I feel like sport is the last place
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:10.580]   where people congregate, right?
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:11.700]   Sports, sidelines.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:14.540]   This is the sort of, you know,
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:17.860]   lingua franca of the whole world.
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:20.180]   I've taught on every continent except Antarctica.
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:21.420]   Everyone knows what a pushup is.
[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:22.340]   Everyone knows what a deadlift is.
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:23.860]   It's not science, sorry.
[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:24.700]   It's not math.
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.780]   That's not the universal language.
[02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:27.540]   It is bench press.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:29.760]   Everyone knows and everyone can tell you
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:31.260]   how much you bench in any language.
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:34.900]   So there are some things there that are universal.
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:39.620]   I think when we look at the human as a moving organism,
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:41.700]   then we can really start to not feel crazy
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:43.980]   about how our world is changing,
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:45.980]   but how do we fight back
[02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:48.900]   by setting up more opportunity to move more?
[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:53.100]   And for me, the whole lens ends up being like,
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:54.260]   we basically as we're trying
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:56.340]   to parse through complex problems.
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:59.380]   So I have a world champion who's injured,
[02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:02.140]   two-time world champion, isn't able to finish a tour.
[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:04.180]   You know, the first question I ask them is,
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:06.260]   tell me about your sleep.
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:07.340]   I'm a rough sleeper.
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:09.260]   Oh, tell me more about that, right?
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:11.140]   Because I can't even tell your inputs and outputs
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:12.820]   unless we're getting into sleep.
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:14.700]   Then I say, well, tell me about your nutrition.
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:15.540]   I eat clean.
[02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:16.580]   Great, find that for me.
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:18.300]   I don't even know what that means, clean.
[02:29:18.300 --> 02:29:20.740]   Turns out under-caloried, under-nutrition,
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:22.820]   doesn't get enough macros, doesn't get enough micros.
[02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:24.540]   I'm like, oh, we start to correct that.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:26.180]   We start to collect sleep.
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.460]   When we really start to divide some of the behaviors into,
[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:31.900]   for me as a 51-year-old,
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.800]   I'm obsessed with my tissues not failing.
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:35.780]   Like tearing an Achilles is like
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:37.620]   every physical therapist's worst nightmare.
[02:29:37.620 --> 02:29:40.500]   And I jump rope every day and I have great range.
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:41.660]   I do so many isometrics.
[02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:43.620]   I'm just not gonna tear my Achilles.
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:44.620]   Now I'm gonna tear my Achilles,
[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:46.060]   but I'm not gonna tear my Achilles.
[02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:48.300]   So tissue health is part of that.
[02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:49.900]   So now I have to look at nutrition.
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.040]   I have to look at my blood work
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.060]   and I have to look at my sleep, right?
[02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:56.220]   So that I can really define some of those things
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:00.060]   as that creates a readiness, tissue tolerance, health.
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:01.660]   Then I can be looking at the other things.
[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:04.260]   And that's really, as we start to get, again,
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:07.660]   the framework of sport or framework of play
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:11.260]   creates this place where I can suddenly start to understand
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:14.060]   inputs and outputs and how to take care of this carcass
[02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:15.660]   so that I can do what I want with my body,
[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:17.640]   which is our new definition of mobility.
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:20.620]   Can I do what I want with my body and can I be pain-free?
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:24.620]   - Am I correct in my very non-scientific assessment
[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.080]   of Instagram accounts,
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:31.080]   whereby when I see a 80 to 100-year-old person moving well,
[02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:36.240]   that person tends to be doing something
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:38.480]   sort of gymnastics related.
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.440]   There's this incredible video guy,
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:42.560]   Chinese guy, very tall Chinese guy doing essentially
[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:44.400]   skin the cat and then into a pull-up.
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:46.440]   Skin the cat, people can look it up.
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:48.680]   It doesn't involve actual cats, hopefully.
[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:50.440]   It shouldn't.
[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:54.160]   85-year-old woman sprinting.
[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:56.120]   So we're talking gymnastics type movement.
[02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:58.820]   - Didn't stop. - Sprinting movement.
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:01.940]   Rarely, sometimes it'll be somebody in a gym
[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:04.940]   lifting a heavy weight, but more often than not,
[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.980]   it's gymnastic type movement.
[02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:11.300]   Pull-up, dip, parallel bar, balance beam, sprinting.
[02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:13.900]   Is that what got them there
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:15.780]   or is that just the expression of what-
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:18.180]   - Genetics, do they feel safe?
[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:20.300]   Show me nutrition, show me their training age.
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:24.140]   But what's noticeable there is that we have disciplines
[02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:25.980]   that require greater range of motion
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:30.620]   and skill of body control and high power output, right?
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:32.900]   Huh, so one of the things that we do
[02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:34.540]   in our programming for adults
[02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:37.700]   is I make you sprint once a week, like sprint,
[02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:38.940]   'cause people have not sprinted.
[02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:40.300]   And I don't mean you can go out and run.
[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:41.900]   I don't think you're capable of that.
[02:31:41.900 --> 02:31:42.940]   But I'm gonna put you on a bike,
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:44.180]   I'm gonna put you in control,
[02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:47.940]   and I'm gonna see what your peak wattage is, that sprinting.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.660]   So ideally, I would love you to be able
[02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:51.660]   to do some hill sprints and repeats,
[02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:53.620]   but I don't think you have the tissue tolerance
[02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:54.900]   or the range of motion for that.
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.900]   And I know what the outcome is gonna be,
[02:31:56.900 --> 02:31:58.660]   but I can put you on a bike and say,
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:00.140]   can we hit this peak wattage?
[02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:02.380]   And what you just discovered there was,
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:04.940]   hey, I still need to maintain my ability to move quickly
[02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:07.420]   and have control through great ranges of motion.
[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:12.060]   That is a recipe for why if you did yoga
[02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:15.700]   and did some sprints, you're gonna be pretty badass.
[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:17.140]   You know, that's a pretty good way.
[02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:19.060]   - And why people who just do the elliptical
[02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:23.460]   and the little small dumbbells, they're fooling themselves.
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:24.420]   - It's a lot of busy work.
[02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.740]   There's a lot of busy work out there.
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:28.780]   It makes people feel like they're involved in a program.
[02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:32.820]   Again, the way we wanna take our feelings out of it,
[02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:34.620]   how do you progress those pink dumbbells?
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:36.900]   1,000 reps is 2,000 reps, right?
[02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:38.020]   Show me progression.
[02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:40.860]   Suddenly, I can't progress and regress those things.
[02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:42.740]   The other thing I wanna say is like,
[02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:44.660]   is it making the thing better?
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:46.380]   What are we training for?
[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:51.300]   And you know, I think it feels decorative to have busy work,
[02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:54.060]   and I do all this prehab corrective exercise.
[02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:55.340]   I'm like, hold up.
[02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:56.620]   Why don't we do the thing we're doing
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:57.940]   and regress and progress that
[02:32:57.940 --> 02:33:00.620]   and ask if you have native range of motion, yes or no?
[02:33:00.620 --> 02:33:03.380]   But you know, if we look at the typical person,
[02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:05.140]   especially someone listening to this podcast,
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:06.660]   they don't have two hours in the gym.
[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:10.020]   So if your program is requiring two hours of me, I'm out.
[02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:11.900]   If it requires an hour of me, I might be out.
[02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:14.860]   You know, I'm so busy that sometimes I eat lots of 30
[02:33:14.860 --> 02:33:17.100]   and 40-minute pieces peppered throughout
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:19.580]   plus a lot of other play, and that's good enough.
[02:33:19.580 --> 02:33:21.620]   So we really do need to look at how people
[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:23.500]   are finding themselves in their environments
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:25.660]   to ask, is this appropriate for you?
[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:27.140]   And what's essential?
[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:29.940]   And it turns out a lot of this, you know,
[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:33.140]   20-something playing around videoing yourself in the gym
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:35.660]   is great when you have three or four hours in the gym.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:38.540]   - Yeah, listening to an entire album or podcast
[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:42.980]   or book chapters in sequence, I think is, if I may,
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:47.660]   far more valuable than allowing oneself the opportunity
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:51.260]   to text and be on social media during a workout
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:53.500]   because it just becomes a very distracted thing.
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:56.180]   I think the workout of any kind is also an opportunity
[02:33:56.180 --> 02:34:00.260]   for building concentration, and one can listen to podcasts
[02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:04.740]   or books, et cetera, or an album sequentially through,
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:08.820]   but I find, at least for myself, if I work out in a way
[02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:12.940]   that's interrupted by social media or texting or email,
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:15.340]   because it's available there, that it carries through
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.140]   into the rest of the day, that I'm more distracted.
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:19.660]   - I believe you.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.500]   How about that?
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:22.140]   - I believe you, and that's what's so great,
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:24.140]   is you're like, "Hey, that doesn't work for me."
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:28.780]   You know, I find that my best thinking is done
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:31.020]   under enormous aerobic load.
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:34.100]   Like, I literally am like, "Oh," and I often will jump up
[02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:35.180]   and write something on the whiteboard
[02:34:35.180 --> 02:34:36.380]   and then go back and do my thing,
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:39.460]   'cause, you know, it creates flow state,
[02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:43.340]   and if I'm distracted, I can't really hear what's going on,
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:46.140]   and there's a time when I wanna distract myself, you know,
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.260]   and there's a time when I wanna be amused, so that's fine.
[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:49.980]   You know, I've got a two-hour ride,
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:53.100]   getting ready for a four-day backcountry ski trip
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:56.220]   here in February, but notice,
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:58.140]   I've already been getting ready for it
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:34:59.220]   in the beginning of November.
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:02.220]   I am ready, it's taking me, gonna ramp up,
[02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:05.140]   and so much of my training now is going towards,
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:07.340]   can I successfully do these four hard days
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:08.380]   the way I want to?
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.060]   So some things come down a little bit,
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:12.020]   strength dials down, I change my body composition,
[02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:13.820]   I'd like to be a little bit lighter, I'm playing,
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:15.540]   but there's some times where I have to get
[02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:18.420]   two and three hours in of steady work done,
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:20.420]   and I'm like, headphones, you know what I mean?
[02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:22.220]   So it's okay to be amused.
[02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.300]   You don't have to be a monk doing what you're doing,
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:26.180]   but I really like what you said.
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.020]   I feel distracted.
[02:35:27.020 --> 02:35:30.900]   Yeah, let's use it as a concentration time, right?
[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:32.780]   Let's use this as interaction time.
[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:34.340]   The gym shouldn't be the loneliest place in the world.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:35.900]   If you're not making eye contact and talking,
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:38.380]   high-fiving, get a different gym.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:41.060]   - I would be remiss if I didn't ask you about fascia.
[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:42.860]   You and Jill Miller were some of the first people
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:47.220]   that I ever heard talk about fascia in an elaborate way,
[02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:49.380]   in a way that allowed me to finally understand
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:53.140]   what this incredible aspect of our physiology,
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.940]   the many things that it's doing.
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:56.820]   I realize this is a vast discussion
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:58.580]   that could take several more hours.
[02:35:58.580 --> 02:36:00.180]   - I'm not a fascia researcher.
[02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:02.940]   - Right, and yet I think, as I recall,
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:04.780]   you're one of the first people to talk about
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:07.460]   the relationship, telling people that there's fascia,
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.060]   that we have this thing called fascia,
[02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:12.540]   clearly an important part of our physiology,
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:13.860]   our ability to move.
[02:36:13.940 --> 02:36:18.380]   To what extent do you think that tight fascia,
[02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:19.900]   quote unquote, I'm probably offending
[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:20.940]   many people in this moment,
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:23.340]   tight fascia restricts our movement
[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:26.140]   and that working on fascial release,
[02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:28.220]   or maneuvering fascial-- - How about mobilization?
[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:31.860]   - Mobilization, thank you, can allow us to move better,
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:33.980]   maybe better posture, maybe even feel better.
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:35.500]   And there are a lot of theories,
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:37.900]   some probably wrong, some probably right,
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:40.420]   about what fascia can and can't do for us.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:41.660]   But what are some things about fascia
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:43.300]   that you find particularly interesting
[02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:44.780]   that you'd like to pass along?
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.620]   - I think what we should do is,
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.820]   if you pull fascia out of the human movement equation,
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:52.140]   human doesn't, it fails to stop moving, right?
[02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:54.860]   So the recent, like, we've just discovered fascia,
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:57.660]   we're like, mm, that's not really entirely true.
[02:36:57.660 --> 02:37:02.060]   There's a really, like, 20-year-old set of videos
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:05.180]   by a guy who was, he describes himself as a vasomonaut.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:07.220]   His name's Gil Headley,
[02:37:07.220 --> 02:37:09.500]   and he did these live dissections on YouTube.
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:10.540]   I don't even know if he's still there.
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:13.380]   But he basically did all of this gross anatomy
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:14.660]   for free on the internet.
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:17.460]   And he describes himself as one of the first people
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:21.460]   to really describe fascia as this sort of incredible,
[02:37:21.460 --> 02:37:24.460]   you know, connective tissue network that envelops, wraps,
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:28.860]   you know, stores energy, communicates, is tensionality.
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:32.260]   In full disclosure, I went to school in Boulder,
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:35.140]   and I may have dated a girl who went to rolfing school
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:35.980]   and was a rolfer.
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:37.780]   And Ida Rolf was one of the first people
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:41.300]   to really talk about how can we mobilize fascia with touch?
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:44.660]   So I was introduced to fascia in the '90s
[02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:46.580]   when I had rolfing done on me.
[02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:49.860]   So when I'm trying to help someone think about pain
[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:52.100]   or restore position, and this is overly gross,
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:54.140]   but it'll create a framework for people,
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:56.400]   we ask, is this an environmental problem?
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.740]   Are you poorly hydrated?
[02:37:57.740 --> 02:38:00.420]   Because your tissues need to be hydrated to slide.
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:01.380]   Are you inflamed?
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:03.180]   Like, that's why we talk about nutrition
[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:04.340]   and we talk about sleep.
[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:06.100]   Okay, so we have this environmental piece.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:07.700]   Then I often will say, hey,
[02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:09.280]   do we have just a movement problem?
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.220]   Do you just have crappy technique?
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:12.960]   Like, let's fix the technique first.
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.220]   Let's get you moving to the highest expression
[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:16.860]   of the movement first.
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:18.400]   Hey, turn your foot straighter.
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.900]   Let's re-centrate that joint.
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:23.400]   Can we have a better organization?
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:24.240]   Then we start to say,
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:25.420]   'cause sometimes it's just a movement problem,
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:26.820]   just you needed some cueing.
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:28.860]   We say, is this a joint capsule problem?
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:30.020]   'Cause capsular stiffness,
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:31.660]   the joint capsule is a bag of connective tissue
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:32.860]   that surrounds all your joints,
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:34.580]   and it can account for huge chunks
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.020]   of your range of motion limitation.
[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:37.260]   So a lot of what we do is we,
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:39.420]   after we try to mobilize the joint tissue,
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:40.820]   and again, that's my own bias.
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:41.660]   The way I was trained,
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:43.380]   I was an Australian trained manual therapist,
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:44.840]   this Maitland school.
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:45.680]   Then we say, well,
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.860]   is this just a good old-fashioned muscle restriction?
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.340]   And we call it muscle dynamics,
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:52.600]   'cause that includes high tone, stress, fear,
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:55.020]   but trigger points are a well-documented phenomenon.
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:38:58.620]   Muscles get stiff, they become fibrotic, right?
[02:38:58.620 --> 02:39:00.380]   You could have high tone trying to protect you,
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:01.200]   all those reasons,
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:02.500]   but that still could limit your range of motion.
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:05.140]   And lastly, we say sliding surfaces.
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:07.140]   So instead of kind of talking about
[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:10.080]   all the different layers of dermis and skin and fascia,
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:14.780]   we say, do the things that slide, are they sliding?
[02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:16.620]   So if you grab your skin on your forehead,
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:18.980]   it should slide in all the directions.
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:20.560]   Notice that the skin should slide
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:23.400]   all the directions over your tendons, right?
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:26.300]   If I grab your typical person's Achilles
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:30.060]   and grab the skin over the Achilles, it doesn't budge.
[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:31.740]   It's like they have an exoskeleton
[02:39:31.740 --> 02:39:34.860]   that's that fascial kind of compartment,
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:37.380]   and it's seized, it's adhered,
[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:39.900]   it's bound to the underlying surfaces,
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:42.980]   which creates tissue restriction and higher tension.
[02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:45.100]   So when we're mobilizing these tissues,
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:47.320]   we're trying to keep tissues sliding and gliding.
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:48.620]   That's an easy way of thinking about it.
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:51.140]   Nerves have to run through nerve tunnels.
[02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:54.100]   Taking huge breaths keeps all of those,
[02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:56.780]   you know, aspects of your trunk moving.
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:00.380]   And we just need to be thinking in like a systems approach.
[02:40:00.380 --> 02:40:04.660]   So sometimes if you went and saw an ART practitioner
[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:06.100]   and it didn't solve your problem-
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:07.500]   - This is active release therapy?
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:08.780]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:11.760]   - It may not have been a fascial problem, right?
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:14.540]   If you went and saw someone who only worked on the muscles,
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:16.020]   it may not have been a muscle problem.
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:17.180]   If you went and saw a chiropractor
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:20.660]   and they worked on your joint structures, right,
[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:21.740]   or a good physio,
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:23.860]   it may not be a joint restriction problem.
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:25.940]   If you saw a coach and they couldn't cue you out of it,
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:26.940]   it may not have been a...
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:28.460]   So what we need to do is we recognize
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:30.580]   that if more squats just solved all the problems,
[02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:32.100]   wouldn't we have solved all the problems?
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:34.420]   If rolling on a roller had solved all the problems,
[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:36.100]   seems like we would have solved all the problems.
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:37.420]   So I think what ends up happening
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:40.180]   is we want to put fascia equally
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:41.700]   as an important part of the system.
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:44.980]   And one of the ways that we can directly impact that
[02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:49.480]   in a free way at home is to begin a conversation
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:53.260]   of just some simple myofascial mobilization.
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:55.820]   In fact, myofascial means muscle fascial,
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:57.780]   but there are osteofascial connections.
[02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:01.380]   Does the fascia glide over the bone there, right?
[02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:04.740]   We can look at the tendinous fascial connections.
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:06.740]   And again, do these tissues slide and glide
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:07.860]   the way they're supposed to slide and glide?
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:09.740]   And that's a much easier way to look at it.
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:12.780]   And I'm gonna test and retest, not with subjective pain,
[02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:14.660]   but how is your range of motion
[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:17.020]   and access to your range of motion?
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:17.860]   - Thank you for that.
[02:41:17.860 --> 02:41:21.720]   I've wanted to try rolfing for a long time.
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:22.980]   And then a friend of mine,
[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:25.620]   who's a former SEAL team operator,
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:28.660]   told me that at some point during the rolfing
[02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:31.860]   that he received, that they put a glove on
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:34.780]   and went up his nostril and did some fascial relief
[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:37.560]   on the release, excuse me, on the inside of his nose.
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.380]   And quote, it was the most painful experience he ever had.
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:43.540]   And I was like, all right, well.
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:45.500]   - I don't even know anyone in Naval Special Warfare,
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:47.180]   but they're so soft.
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:48.420]   - Right.
[02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:50.780]   I didn't say that, Kelly said that.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:51.940]   - You know who you are, my friends.
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:56.940]   But I confess, it's not like I avoid pain at all costs,
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:42:03.300]   but that made me think that I might not wanna do rolfing.
[02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:05.860]   I also don't want someone putting their finger up my nose.
[02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:07.300]   So I'm assuming that I could say,
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:11.020]   hey, I wanna try rolfing and I don't need to get,
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:12.380]   because you hear this stuff like,
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:14.300]   oh, there's all this emotional release,
[02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:16.300]   which there are other ways to get that.
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:20.260]   I guess, is it always painful, is the question?
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:21.420]   Does it need to be painful?
[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:24.020]   This statement is pretty severe.
[02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:26.180]   - Let's pull rolfing outside, 'cause I'm not a rolfer.
[02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:27.940]   But let's just say that mobilizing your tissues
[02:42:27.940 --> 02:42:29.060]   doesn't have to be painful.
[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:32.580]   In fact, it's likely that you'll experience some discomfort.
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:35.540]   But let's talk about a couple guideposts for you.
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:37.780]   Number one, you always have to be able to take a full breath.
[02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:41.240]   So if I'm mobilizing you, or you're mobilizing yourself,
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:45.100]   and you suddenly stop breathing, you're going too deep.
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:46.900]   So an easy way for you is to say,
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:48.500]   hey, can I breathe here?
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:51.780]   Number two, I like to have volitional contraction.
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:54.100]   So if I'm mobilizing someone or someone's doing something,
[02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:55.580]   I should be able to flex them out.
[02:42:55.580 --> 02:42:56.660]   I should have control over that.
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:42:58.700]   If the pain or depth or pressure
[02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:00.220]   is putting too much load on the system,
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:02.580]   where I literally lose neuromuscular control,
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:04.420]   what am I doing, right?
[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:07.940]   And then those two pieces, can I take a breath here?
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:09.340]   Do I have control here?
[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:12.260]   Those go a long way to keeping me in the balance.
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:14.140]   And then we tend to not work on a tissue
[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:16.000]   longer than five minutes,
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.940]   just because I wanna get the rest of it tomorrow.
[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:21.140]   And if you give me 10 minutes of work, that's incredible.
[02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:23.860]   We like to put the soft tissue work before we go to bed.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:26.620]   And what we found was that we had better adherence.
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:28.940]   No one's doing anything productive in the 10 minutes
[02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:30.460]   before they go to the bedroom.
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:33.660]   Number two, like a child, when you put a child to bed,
[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:35.740]   you're like, first we take a bath,
[02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:38.100]   then we read the book, and then we go to bed, right?
[02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:39.980]   Your brain is like, I know what comes next.
[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:42.980]   So if you do this rolling or on your soft tissue work,
[02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:46.420]   self-massage, you are training your brain
[02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:47.900]   to know what comes next.
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:51.060]   We find that when people have engaged in massage
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:52.620]   or self-massage, they don't stand up
[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:53.520]   and wanna fight anyone.
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:54.820]   They're very relaxed.
[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:57.380]   If you've ever gone to a spa and had a massage,
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:59.500]   you don't go out and snatch or get into a fight afterwards.
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:00.900]   You're so chill, bro.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:03.580]   So we found is a great way to, as Jill Miller says,
[02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:05.600]   switch on the off switch.
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:07.340]   That's a beautiful way of talking about that.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:10.380]   How do I tell myself to shift out of this,
[02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:13.100]   you know, fight or flight into coming down?
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:16.660]   Five minutes per body part, start anywhere on the leg,
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:18.580]   start anywhere stiff, what's asking,
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:20.660]   can I breathe, can I contract?
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:23.180]   You're gonna see that that's a really simple way
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:24.340]   to start getting some input.
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:26.660]   And not all your tissues are the same.
[02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:28.580]   If you come to me with knee pain,
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:31.800]   I'm gonna wanna be able to look at your positions,
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:34.020]   but I'm also gonna wanna be able to stay on your quads.
[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:35.180]   I mean, my full body weight.
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:38.540]   And if you can't take that, I'm calling that incomplete.
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:40.620]   And those people out there who are gonna be like,
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:42.020]   whoa, that's heavy duty.
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:44.140]   You have not worked with my population
[02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:47.140]   who have monster thighs, are thick and fibrotic,
[02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:48.300]   and it takes real weight.
[02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:50.340]   So we all have different sensitivities,
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:54.060]   but if I respect your ability to take a breath and contract,
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:57.580]   then all of a sudden we're upregulating.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:44:59.940]   What I recommend is you go to Thailand,
[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:02.980]   you get a Thai massage from a 65 year old master woman
[02:45:02.980 --> 02:45:04.860]   who weighs 109 pounds.
[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:08.380]   And when she is working on your quads and you tap out,
[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:10.300]   she's like, no, I'm not done here.
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:11.460]   You felt your quads,
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:14.260]   you're gonna realize how low the bar is.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.100]   - All right.
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:18.660]   Heat and cold.
[02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:20.840]   You were one of the first people that told me,
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:22.060]   hey, listen, cold's great.
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.540]   Cold plunges, cold showers are great
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:27.040]   for shifting your state, for resilience training.
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.260]   - It's fun. - It's fun.
[02:45:30.260 --> 02:45:32.060]   - I swam with Laird's pool this morning.
[02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:33.420]   Did the breath hold cold laps?
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:35.340]   It's fun, I'm gonna put in quotation marks.
[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:38.180]   - Yeah, it's- - Sometimes it's type two fun.
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:40.860]   - It definitely will shift one's state
[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:44.100]   for many hours afterwards, for reasons we now understand.
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:46.340]   But you were one of the first people to point out to me
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:49.220]   that for injuries, oftentimes,
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:51.260]   it's better to perfuse the tissue
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:54.020]   and that heat sometimes, perhaps,
[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:57.580]   is the more favorable tool if you had to pick one.
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:58.420]   - That's right.
[02:45:58.420 --> 02:46:02.760]   So you, I think, have even talked about
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.220]   that there is research to show that cold water immersion
[02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:09.300]   can attenuate training effects.
[02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:11.720]   - If done in the six to eight hours
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:13.780]   after hypertrophy and strength training,
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:17.300]   because of its potent anti-inflammatory properties,
[02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:18.620]   prevents some of the inflammation
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:20.980]   that would prompt the adaptation response.
[02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:23.660]   And put simply, if your goal is bigger muscles
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:24.540]   and getting stronger,
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:28.460]   don't do immersion-based deliberate cold exposure
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:32.100]   in the six to eight hours after your training.
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.700]   Fine to do it on other days, fine to do it beforehand.
[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:36.220]   In fact, athletes at Stanford do that
[02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:39.300]   on the basis of a lot of work from Craig Heller and others.
[02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:41.180]   Fine to not do it at all if you don't wanna do it.
[02:46:41.180 --> 02:46:43.120]   Again, I'm not a, I'm not a,
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:47.580]   I'm not gonna die on the sword of cold plunging,
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:51.300]   but it can attenuate or even prevent those adaptations.
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:53.120]   But at other times, it's a great tool
[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:55.500]   for reducing inflammation,
[02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:57.220]   shifting one's mental and physical state
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:58.780]   in the right direction.
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:00.080]   Look, it always sucks to get in the thing.
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:02.180]   The whole point is you feel much better when you get out
[02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:03.940]   than you did before you ever got in.
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:05.140]   That's the simplest way to put it.
[02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:07.300]   I am a middle-aged guy who wants to be
[02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:10.300]   the best middle-aged mountain biker in my neighborhood.
[02:47:10.300 --> 02:47:14.780]   Is my timing of my plunge going to affect my ability
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:17.540]   to be that mediocre athlete?
[02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:19.340]   No, so stop it.
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:21.580]   People are like, when's the optimal time?
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:23.280]   I'm like, when's it work for you?
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:24.840]   Does it, is that first thing in the morning?
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.460]   Juliette found that if she got hot
[02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:28.580]   and plunged it in the night,
[02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:31.780]   she was like woken up and fired up and ready.
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:33.180]   She's like, I'm not going to sleep now.
[02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:34.660]   And I get hot and cold, hot and cold,
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:36.860]   it's like someone hits the emergency brake, right?
[02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:40.180]   So first of all, when's it work for you, right?
[02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:42.140]   Second of all, if there is a performance concern,
[02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:44.140]   we try to put it as far away from training as we can.
[02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:45.020]   That's what we say.
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:47.080]   Training in the evening, plunge before.
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:49.060]   If you like, you've trained in the morning,
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:49.900]   plunge in the evening.
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:51.160]   Like get cold, that's cool.
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:53.260]   But what you hinted at is the same reasons
[02:47:53.260 --> 02:47:55.420]   why we don't ice injuries,
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:59.700]   because it limits our body's ability to heal.
[02:47:59.700 --> 02:48:00.860]   So it rate limits,
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:03.500]   and it might do it by phasal constriction.
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:05.820]   Your body, eventually your body is going to warm up anyway.
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:07.180]   So one of the things we like to say
[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:10.260]   is your body either heals at the rate of a human being,
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:12.340]   or it heals slower.
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:13.860]   So there's no such thing as a fast healer.
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:15.460]   You're just, oh, you're really good at healing
[02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:17.260]   at the rate of human physiology,
[02:48:17.260 --> 02:48:19.220]   and the rest of us are doing dumb things
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:21.020]   that are rate limiting our healing.
[02:48:21.020 --> 02:48:23.420]   Nutrition, sleep, right?
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:27.540]   When we are talking about anyone after surgery or injury,
[02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:29.660]   our benchmark in the line of the sand
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:31.700]   is eight hours of laying in bed
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:32.720]   without looking at your phone.
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:34.100]   That's minimum.
[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:35.380]   And I don't care if you're sleeping,
[02:48:35.380 --> 02:48:37.220]   'cause resting is the next best thing,
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:40.940]   but I can't actually understand inputs and outputs.
[02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:42.260]   And let me be super clear.
[02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:44.020]   If you're trying to grow a body,
[02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:46.700]   learn a skill, change your body composition,
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:50.820]   get stronger, heal, that all rhymes with eight hours.
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:52.580]   We look seven as our minimum.
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:54.500]   And of course you're a human being, you're going to get by.
[02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:55.700]   I was stressed out last night
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:57.500]   and wanted to come on this show with my friend, Andrew,
[02:48:57.500 --> 02:48:58.340]   and do a good job.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:48:59.820]   Like I didn't get great sleep,
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:02.300]   but I'm a human being, I'm still going to show up.
[02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:05.680]   So what's nice then is we can start to say,
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:08.660]   okay, what can we control in terms of managing
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:12.300]   and upregulating, boosting maximal healing rate for humans?
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:16.220]   And it turns out cold water may not be the best.
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:19.580]   Icing something might suppress prostaglandin release, right?
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:20.860]   Which means that you can think of it
[02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:22.820]   as you have these circulating stem cells.
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:26.620]   And again, sorry everyone, get this just very cursory.
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:28.980]   And we need the chemical signalers
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:31.180]   from the injured damaged tissue
[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:32.600]   to call those things to be.
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:35.060]   But if I ice that and suppress that,
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:37.420]   some of those cells can go swinging on past.
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:40.620]   There was a great study I saw a million years ago,
[02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:43.860]   and it looked at ibuprofen usage
[02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:46.780]   in Australian military tactical athletes
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:48.460]   who had bad ankle sprains.
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:51.100]   And those athletes who were given ibuprofen,
[02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:52.700]   which does the same thing as ice,
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:55.780]   suppresses prostaglandin release, right?
[02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:57.060]   Cuts off some of those chemical signals,
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:00.420]   were back faster than their counterparts
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:02.380]   who did not have the ibuprofen,
[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:04.240]   but they had chronic ankle instability
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:07.900]   because they did not have a sufficient healing response
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:10.340]   because they had shut that healing response down.
[02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:12.620]   So what we find is, look,
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:15.700]   your body will wait until it warms back up.
[02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:18.420]   But if you think you're gonna do angiogenesis
[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:21.440]   and make new capillaries and modulate all these things
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.600]   by slapping a nonspecific ice pad
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:26.540]   for a nonspecific amount of time over a nonspecific tissue,
[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:27.700]   you gotta be kidding me.
[02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:29.580]   And so it's really Mickey Mouse.
[02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:31.700]   Does ice help for margaritas that are warm?
[02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:32.540]   Yes.
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:33.460]   Open heart surgery?
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:34.300]   Yes.
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:35.140]   Right?
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:35.960]   - Waking you up in the morning.
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:36.800]   - Waking you up in the morning.
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:39.580]   Hey, I have a kid who needs a placebo.
[02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:42.280]   I can numb that thing and give my kids some placebo ice.
[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:44.020]   That's great.
[02:50:44.020 --> 02:50:45.660]   Definitely can work for pain control
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.900]   because as soon as you're numb, you can't feel anything.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:50.160]   But what's gonna happen when you pull that thing off?
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:51.000]   We're gonna come back.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.540]   So we have found that we have much better.
[02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:55.400]   And again, instead of saying, that's bad,
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:56.420]   we're turning out and saying,
[02:50:56.420 --> 02:50:58.660]   we have so many better tools now
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:50:59.980]   to manage congestion,
[02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:01.180]   'cause that's really what we're trying to do
[02:51:01.180 --> 02:51:02.540]   with ice and healing,
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:05.900]   is we're trying to stop swelling, right?
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:08.940]   But is swelling a mistake by the body?
[02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:11.060]   And the chances are, it's not really a mistake.
[02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:12.580]   Again, two and a half million years of evolution,
[02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:14.140]   this stuff's pretty awesome.
[02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:16.300]   But what we know is failure to move
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:19.060]   and evacuate that swelling is a problem.
[02:51:19.060 --> 02:51:22.140]   So when we get people on non-fatiguing muscle contraction
[02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:24.980]   NMES devices like the H-Wave or something like that,
[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:28.060]   we find that we can actually decongest
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:31.740]   and keep moving in controlled ways.
[02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:33.460]   And we have much better clinical outcomes
[02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:34.420]   than we do if we ice.
[02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:37.420]   - What about heating pads, hot water bottles, sauna?
[02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:38.460]   Do you sit in the sauna?
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:39.360]   - Yes, I do.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:40.200]   Love the sauna.
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:41.260]   - How often are you in the saunas?
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:42.860]   - Whenever I can.
[02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:44.260]   And sometimes it's short sessions
[02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:45.900]   and sometimes it's super hot sessions.
[02:51:45.900 --> 02:51:48.420]   And sometimes I just get hot and cold a couple of times.
[02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:51.460]   And I try, like you said earlier,
[02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:54.940]   I'm not after some specific adaptation response.
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:57.060]   The sauna is a great way for us to chill out
[02:51:57.060 --> 02:51:57.980]   and hang out.
[02:51:57.980 --> 02:52:00.100]   And sometimes we're bored and we got to make dinner
[02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:00.940]   or move on.
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:01.980]   So I try to sauna.
[02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:04.620]   If there's anything I do, I sauna a lot.
[02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:06.300]   Bigger the engine, the bigger the brakes.
[02:52:06.300 --> 02:52:08.020]   And for me, it's such a big brake.
[02:52:08.020 --> 02:52:09.860]   - You mentioned Laird.
[02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:12.500]   I've seen Laird drag the assault bike into the sauna,
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:14.340]   something most people probably shouldn't do
[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:17.100]   'cause they would die of hyperthermia.
[02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:18.580]   - We call that Restrepo.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:20.860]   It's the worst place on earth.
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:23.820]   - It's an interesting tool though, the heat.
[02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:27.900]   I find that if I get the sauna uncomfortably hot
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:32.180]   and then force myself to breathe super slowly
[02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:35.060]   only through my nose so that I don't actually feel
[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:37.220]   like a burning sensation on the inside of my nostrils.
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:40.220]   And I just do that for 10, 15 minutes
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:43.220]   that it's wonderful stress resilience training.
[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:44.060]   - How great is that?
[02:52:44.060 --> 02:52:45.620]   - But very different than the cold plunge
[02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:47.020]   where you can either muscle through it
[02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:49.420]   or distract yourself or whatever.
[02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:52.100]   In the heat, your heart rate's going up
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:56.700]   and there's this temptation to follow that heart rate
[02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:59.420]   toward a more elevated stress state.
[02:52:59.420 --> 02:53:02.540]   And so I find that you can get very, very hot,
[02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:04.540]   obviously be safe about this folks,
[02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:07.980]   but still maintain a lot of calm.
[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:09.740]   And I think it's a wonderful tool,
[02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:11.260]   but you have to kind of work at it.
[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:12.340]   And I enjoy this by the way.
[02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:13.740]   So people are probably thinking, here you go again,
[02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:15.860]   like why not just enjoy the sauna?
[02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:17.700]   But I like to listen to Gregorian chants
[02:53:17.700 --> 02:53:19.580]   or something in there and do this like very like,
[02:53:19.580 --> 02:53:22.300]   how even and calm can I stay.
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:23.140]   - Oh, I love that.
[02:53:23.140 --> 02:53:24.980]   - At 215 or 220.
[02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:27.980]   And I wear the cap so those higher heats
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:29.780]   don't register to the brain.
[02:53:29.780 --> 02:53:31.020]   - You will drive yourself out.
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:32.700]   Eventually your brain is gonna just,
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:35.500]   what drives me out of the sauna now is I retch.
[02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:37.660]   I actually like feel like I'm gonna vomit
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:38.940]   because I've gotten so hot.
[02:53:38.940 --> 02:53:42.460]   My brainstem is like, bro, you can just override.
[02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:46.020]   So I'm like, got to get out and I get out of the sauna.
[02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:48.420]   And then one of the reasons I love the cold so much,
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:50.460]   which I've been our pool or a cold plunges,
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:51.660]   I can get back in the sauna.
[02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:52.820]   - Right, right.
[02:53:52.820 --> 02:53:54.900]   It's the contrast of, I try to do it once a week.
[02:53:54.900 --> 02:53:56.700]   Sauna cold, sauna cold, sauna cold.
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:58.820]   Once a week, you know, again,
[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:00.380]   not training for any specific thing,
[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:02.220]   except to be able to go back to Jocko's house
[02:54:02.220 --> 02:54:03.700]   'cause I did sauna at Jocko's house
[02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:06.180]   with some family members of his and friends.
[02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:08.780]   And I think they wanted to see when I would tap.
[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:09.620]   - They wanted to crush you.
[02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:11.020]   - So they went, I think they cranked that thing
[02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:16.020]   to like 220, 230 and they caught, he got me on this.
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:18.940]   I ended up down on the floor, you know,
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:20.100]   and they were teasing me
[02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:21.980]   'cause it's obviously cooler down on the floor
[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:23.020]   than it is up top.
[02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:26.260]   And so they call that the Huberman spot, the wimpy spot.
[02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:28.920]   But yeah, he's a beast with the sauna.
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.700]   - Everyone, it's not a contest.
[02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:33.420]   - It is in the willing household.
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:34.260]   I'll tell you, it absolutely is.
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:37.860]   - One of the things I like about the heat and the cold
[02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:40.980]   is that it informs me about my readiness state
[02:54:40.980 --> 02:54:43.160]   because just like my CO2 tolerance,
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.040]   my breath holds are very short when I'm stressed.
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:47.780]   And under recovered.
[02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:51.060]   My heat tolerance drops dramatically
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:52.820]   and so does my cold tolerance.
[02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:54.820]   It's easier to pick up really fast.
[02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:55.780]   I start shivering right away.
[02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:57.740]   I'm like, whoa, I've been in here for 30 seconds.
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:54:58.820]   I'm already shivering.
[02:54:58.820 --> 02:55:00.540]   I'm like, huh, another piece of data that says
[02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:04.160]   maybe I need to make it a 70% day in the gym and move.
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.800]   I don't have to take a day off.
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:07.780]   We believe, Juliet and I believe
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:10.060]   in this thing called desire to train.
[02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:12.020]   We wake up every day like you,
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:15.220]   probably self-medicated with some exercise as kids, right?
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:17.480]   And we start thinking about what we're gonna exercise.
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:18.320]   What are we gonna do?
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:19.140]   We're gonna ride our bikes.
[02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:19.980]   What are we gonna do?
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:20.820]   What are we gonna lift?
[02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:21.640]   Like when we wake up,
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:22.760]   we start thinking about when are we gonna do it?
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.400]   And we wake up on some days and it's not there.
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:27.360]   And what we ask ourselves, is it not there?
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:28.200]   Why is it not there?
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:29.020]   Is it me?
[02:55:29.020 --> 02:55:29.860]   I should be there.
[02:55:29.860 --> 02:55:30.680]   We should go train anyway.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:32.480]   But we really try to listen to that voice.
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:34.520]   And when there's no desire to train,
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:35.880]   it's really strange how it correlates
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:38.520]   with crap heat tolerance, crap CO2 tolerance,
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:39.920]   crap cold tolerance.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:42.840]   And I think it's a nice way of understanding yourself
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:45.160]   from sort of a third party objective measure.
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:46.280]   Especially as you get good at this,
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:47.900]   you're like, wow, that really sucked today.
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:48.740]   - Yeah, I love that.
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:51.880]   I think assessing one's degree
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:55.800]   of kind of forward center of mass for effort is great.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:57.600]   I'm borrowing this analogy from somebody else.
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:59.200]   I didn't come up with this.
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:02.040]   He said, with all things, you're either back on your heels,
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:04.880]   flat footed or forward center of mass.
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:07.040]   And I think we've heard a lot about,
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:08.080]   trying to encourage ourselves
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:09.320]   to always be forward center mass.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:13.200]   What I'm hearing today is that great to do that sometimes,
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.440]   great sometimes to back off,
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:18.640]   but to just explore the full range of,
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:20.020]   for lack of a better way to put it,
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:23.320]   sort of emotional range of motion, you know.
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:24.840]   - Yeah, and remember,
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:27.520]   ultimately all this is supposed to be additive, right?
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.060]   And it's supposed to inoculate me
[02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:33.680]   by creating a framework that makes more durable
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:36.560]   my body and my relationships.
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:38.280]   I mean, we didn't even talk about the fact
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:41.560]   that the sauna is like, it's just glue for people.
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:43.080]   It allows people to come together.
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:45.600]   I think one of the things I've noticed with my male friends
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:47.600]   is that it gives us a place like once a week
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:49.320]   where we get together because it's so hot.
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:51.120]   We're all super vulnerable.
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:52.160]   - The truth barrel.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:56.400]   - We talk with our friends and we kind of share stories
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.600]   and can we talk about our lives.
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:00.480]   And so it creates a framework for that.
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:02.840]   And if that was the benefit of the sauna, I'm in.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:03.960]   Just that alone, right?
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:06.360]   That my wife and I feel more connected
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:07.680]   after taking a sauna together.
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:10.680]   I'm like, oh, who cares about the heat shock proteins
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:11.760]   and Alzheimer's?
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:13.160]   That's probably important too.
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:15.000]   But I like having a lot of bottom things.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:19.520]   And I think it's easy for us to sort of so hyperscience
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:23.320]   and hyper tactic things that we forget the whole point
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.220]   of the brain is to be around other brains.
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:26.060]   That's it.
[02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:27.160]   That's why the brain exists.
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:30.000]   And then those brains go do rad shit in the world together.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.160]   And sometimes it's that simple.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:33.960]   And when we start throwing that filter on,
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:35.220]   it becomes a lot more sustainable.
[02:57:35.220 --> 02:57:37.000]   I'm not interested in being 110.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.280]   I'm interested in being durable enough to take the hits
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:40.560]   on my way to 110.
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:41.720]   - I love that.
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:44.600]   Some of my best friendships have been forged in the sauna.
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:45.440]   - That's true, right?
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:46.920]   - And not by pushing ourselves necessarily.
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:49.600]   Just become the thing, you know?
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:51.160]   - It's so cool.
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:55.160]   I know that some of my New Zealand teams have a kava.
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:57.760]   They call it recovery.
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:00.240]   And sometimes they'll share, have a kava ceremony
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:02.240]   and drink a little kava and then jump in the sauna.
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:04.680]   And boy, it really binds the boys.
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:07.760]   You know, that really creates a down regulation effect.
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:11.880]   I mean, it's, so, you know, I think, again,
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:14.120]   my own bias, because I love this stuff,
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:18.240]   is that I think all of it is about physical input.
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:21.280]   So if we took a sort of macro step back,
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:24.080]   what you say is, what does your physical practice look like?
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:25.320]   Tell me about your physical practice.
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:28.600]   Well, I get up and move my body and I try to eat a fruit
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:30.160]   and some protein before I get out the door.
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:31.280]   And I walk all day long.
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:33.360]   And I try not to sit in one period of place
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:34.660]   for a long period of time.
[02:58:34.660 --> 02:58:37.240]   And then I get home and if I'm lucky enough to exercise,
[02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:40.000]   I do, and then I sat on the floor and I roll a little bit,
[02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.440]   but that's a full practice.
[02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:44.600]   You walked, you got sunlight, you know what I mean?
[02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:46.600]   And that, I think, is a much better way
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:48.440]   of thinking about this versus sort of,
[02:58:48.440 --> 02:58:51.600]   let me add another line of code to your programming
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:54.960]   where now you're doing three sets of 10 in this thing.
[02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:57.320]   What are your thoughts on nutrition?
[02:58:57.320 --> 02:59:01.040]   You seem to be pretty balanced about this.
[02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:02.400]   Before we started recording,
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.600]   you were talking about some meatloaf recipes
[02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.280]   that sound pretty amazing.
[02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:07.320]   Clearly, you love food.
[02:59:07.320 --> 02:59:08.680]   I'm not gonna say I'm the best at meatloaf,
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:10.900]   but I may be seven out of 11 times
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:12.840]   bamboo terrace bench champion.
[02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:15.820]   I'm gonna get a tattoo, but it's fine.
[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:18.000]   You enjoy food.
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:19.480]   I love food.
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:23.200]   So you like to eat and you cook a bit as well.
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:28.880]   Most people feel, I think, kind of overwhelmed
[02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:30.160]   that the discussions about nutrition.
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:31.500]   Now we're trying to get a gram of protein
[02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:33.700]   per pound of body weight, which I subscribe to.
[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:35.580]   But if I'm supposed to spread that out across the day,
[02:59:35.580 --> 02:59:37.480]   sometimes I'm doing that, sometimes I'm not.
[02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:39.040]   I like fruits and vegetables.
[02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:40.640]   Do you feel like a failure because you didn't have a gram?
[02:59:40.640 --> 02:59:43.960]   I mean, honestly, it can feel for people like,
[02:59:43.960 --> 02:59:45.480]   oh, I didn't do it.
[02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:48.640]   No, I think if people make getting high quality,
[02:59:48.640 --> 02:59:50.600]   high protein to calorie ratio foods
[02:59:50.600 --> 02:59:53.240]   as the foundation of their diet,
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:55.980]   and then eating some vegetables and eating some fruit.
[02:59:55.980 --> 02:59:57.680]   Whoa, bro, what about the peels?
[02:59:57.680 --> 02:59:58.520]   You're gonna kill people.
[02:59:58.520 --> 02:59:59.960]   And then, I love that spot.
[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:01.440]   Bananas, dangerous, son.
[03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:03.520]   I'll eat the orange peel if it's a really good orange.
[03:00:03.520 --> 03:00:04.360]   I will.
[03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:06.520]   I mean, I've gotten some wide eyes at meals
[03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:07.960]   where I'll take the lemons out of my drink,
[03:00:07.960 --> 03:00:09.080]   I'll just eat the whole thing down.
[03:00:09.080 --> 03:00:09.920]   I don't care.
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:10.840]   Someone will tell me why it's gonna kill me,
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:14.120]   but I don't eat the seeds, but I'll eat the peel too.
[03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:17.240]   So some vegetables, fruit, and then some starches
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:22.120]   per energetic requirements and/or real life.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:24.420]   Like, I'm not gonna stay away from the sourdough bread
[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:25.860]   because I don't need a starch there.
[03:00:25.860 --> 03:00:27.480]   I'll have a little bit of it.
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:30.820]   I feel like we've lost our rational approach to eating
[03:00:30.820 --> 03:00:34.000]   because people feel these quantifiable metrics
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.900]   of calories and protein, they're important, clearly.
[03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:39.660]   But I've always known you to be somebody
[03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:43.500]   who's very balanced about the occasional ice cream,
[03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:45.420]   yes, steak, but also vegetables.
[03:00:45.420 --> 03:00:48.900]   I mean, A, why do you think that the nutrition conversation
[03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:52.020]   has gotten so distracted, even contentious?
[03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:53.460]   And B, what do you do?
[03:00:53.460 --> 03:00:57.100]   And if you were gonna raise a kid, you've raised kids.
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:58.700]   If you were gonna raise a kid and say,
[03:00:58.700 --> 03:01:02.820]   "Here's what balanced nutrition looks like to you."
[03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:04.220]   Okay, I'm not calling you a nutritionist.
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:06.220]   I'm saying to you, how do you see this picture?
[03:01:06.220 --> 03:01:07.500]   - Well, what I wanna point out
[03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:08.980]   is that if we're gonna have a conversation,
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:12.420]   remember my real job, day job, is high performance.
[03:01:12.420 --> 03:01:14.220]   I'm gonna have to talk about body composition.
[03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:15.940]   I'm gonna have to talk about fueling.
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:17.420]   Do you have enough carbs on board
[03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:19.140]   to do what we're gonna do?
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:22.260]   Are you eating to recover, to reduce the session cost?
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:24.860]   How do we minimize the physiologic cost
[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:26.380]   of this training and this competition?
[03:01:26.380 --> 03:01:28.500]   And that's all wrapped around nutrition.
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:30.780]   I already hinted at, I'm gonna have to talk
[03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:32.460]   and ultimately ask you to get a blood panel
[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:34.780]   and make sure that you have everything on board
[03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:36.660]   so that your tissues are tissues
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:38.260]   and can handle the loading we're prescribing them.
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:42.740]   So I didn't wanna get into nutrition at all
[03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:44.580]   because it's always about body composition for me.
[03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:47.700]   And I'm like, that's the most boring reason.
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:52.380]   Like we, Shawn Stevenson, wrote a beautiful book
[03:01:52.380 --> 03:01:54.980]   about creating a table culture
[03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:57.100]   and a culture around eating for your family.
[03:01:57.100 --> 03:02:00.460]   So for me, the functional unit of change is the household.
[03:02:00.460 --> 03:02:02.100]   That's the place where I wanna make
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:03.380]   and put all my energy and time.
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:04.540]   That's how we'll transform society,
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.340]   one household at a time.
[03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:07.740]   But sitting down with your kids,
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.500]   the research around eating with your kids
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:12.260]   like twice or three times a week is phenomenal, right?
[03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:15.580]   Like cooking is beautiful.
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:18.420]   I have to become more nuanced
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:21.180]   because if I have a team I'm working with,
[03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:25.380]   like we had a tournament two weeks ago at Stanford,
[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:29.780]   we played four games and that's four collegiate,
[03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:33.540]   nationally ranked teams that were playing badasses.
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:36.420]   How do I fuel those women?
[03:02:36.420 --> 03:02:37.260]   How do I get them?
[03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:38.340]   What do they wanna eat?
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:39.740]   What makes them feel good?
[03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:40.980]   What makes them feel bad?
[03:02:40.980 --> 03:02:42.380]   How do we balance all of that?
[03:02:42.380 --> 03:02:47.020]   Like I found out that putting food on a table
[03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:49.580]   with a tablecloth increased calories.
[03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:51.700]   Again, as a high performance for me,
[03:02:51.700 --> 03:02:54.780]   I'm like, how are the ways that I can be thinking about this
[03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:57.460]   from a practical standpoint?
[03:02:57.460 --> 03:03:01.700]   My personal thing is that we focus on trying to create,
[03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:03.420]   this has been really useful for Juliet and I,
[03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:05.620]   an objective measure, 0.8 to one grams of protein,
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:07.500]   which means I don't measure anymore.
[03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:08.340]   - Per pound of body weight.
[03:03:08.340 --> 03:03:09.980]   - Yeah, I'm 51 years old, per pound body weight.
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:11.180]   So what does that mean?
[03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:13.540]   It means that I really try to prioritize protein every meal.
[03:03:13.540 --> 03:03:14.380]   Super simple.
[03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:15.200]   And I try not to eat one protein.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:16.960]   I try to eat all the proteins, right?
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:18.260]   That's probably better.
[03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:20.980]   I try not to choose personally very fatty proteins
[03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:22.900]   because my genetics don't really support it.
[03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:26.100]   If I wanna see triglycerides and things go through the roof,
[03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:28.700]   then I'll, you know, watch me eat eggs and butter and steak,
[03:03:28.700 --> 03:03:31.020]   like keto gives me diarrhea.
[03:03:31.020 --> 03:03:35.700]   So what I'll say is I try to go for leaner proteins there.
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:37.740]   And then on the fruits and vegetables,
[03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:39.940]   because I think we have a real problem
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:41.260]   with not enough micronutrients,
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:42.460]   again, talking about tissue health,
[03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:44.520]   and definitely not enough fiber.
[03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:45.900]   Those are huge problems.
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:49.120]   And if I get 800 grams of fruits and vegetables,
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:52.340]   this is a nutrition strategy promoted by our friend,
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:55.380]   E.C. Sienkowski of @OptimizeMeNutrition.
[03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:58.700]   She put this 800-gram challenge based on some research,
[03:03:58.700 --> 03:03:59.980]   and it changed everything.
[03:03:59.980 --> 03:04:02.260]   Because suddenly I was like, "Oh my God,
[03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:03.100]   "I gotta eat more food.
[03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:04.740]   "I have to eat more fruits and vegetables."
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:08.060]   And I was stuffing myself with fruits and vegetables,
[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:09.120]   getting enough protein that I was like,
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:11.360]   "Oh, I guess there's no room for a cookie."
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:13.260]   You know, and what I really liked about that,
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:16.300]   it was agnostic about your cultural preferences.
[03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:17.820]   It didn't matter if you were a vegan,
[03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:18.860]   didn't matter if you're a vegetarian,
[03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:19.860]   didn't matter if you were a carnivore.
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:21.600]   You wanna do carnivore plus berries?
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:22.860]   Knock yourself right out.
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:26.540]   It gave people permission to have their food identities,
[03:04:26.540 --> 03:04:28.860]   but it also met the minimums.
[03:04:28.860 --> 03:04:31.380]   And then we can dose up and dose down
[03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:33.460]   based on what your performance needs are.
[03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:35.940]   - And this is 800 grams, not of carbohydrate.
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:37.780]   This is 800 grams of- - Of fruits and vegetables.
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.180]   It's like four big apples.
[03:04:39.180 --> 03:04:40.020]   - Gotcha.
[03:04:40.020 --> 03:04:41.900]   - A banana is like 80 to 100 grams.
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:42.740]   - Okay.
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:43.980]   - Yeah, if you wanna be real dangerous,
[03:04:43.980 --> 03:04:46.420]   you ate eight bananas today, you could die.
[03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:47.700]   I mean, you could die.
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:51.880]   - And a big salad with, you know, less cucumber, tomato.
[03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:54.520]   - Probably, probably two to 300 grams.
[03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:56.440]   - Okay, so then you'd also wanna get some fruit,
[03:04:56.440 --> 03:05:00.320]   maybe another, maybe some cruciferous vegetables, et cetera.
[03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:01.400]   - Check this out.
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:04.080]   Again, I'm just gonna do some boy math here.
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:06.600]   Starbucks cookie, delicious.
[03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:07.440]   - Really?
[03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:10.600]   - 300 calories, I'm just gonna call it delicious, right?
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:13.720]   A pound of cherries is 230 calories.
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.840]   So eat a pound of cherries and tell me you're like,
[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:17.440]   "Ah, I still want something sweet."
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:19.380]   A pound of melon, what is it, like 220 calories?
[03:05:19.380 --> 03:05:21.240]   A pound of melon?
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:24.980]   So calorically, not very dense, right?
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:26.800]   But nutritionally, super dense.
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:30.700]   So we end up loading a ton of more food on
[03:05:30.700 --> 03:05:32.600]   and it really does prioritize those things.
[03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:34.540]   And from a performance standpoint,
[03:05:34.540 --> 03:05:36.880]   one of our friends is this incredible nutritionist
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:39.420]   at Michigan football.
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:41.300]   Abigail is amazing there.
[03:05:41.300 --> 03:05:45.620]   And she will tell me about how she's using nutrition
[03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:47.300]   as intervention for sports performance.
[03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:50.040]   And she'll have men come up to her and say,
[03:05:50.040 --> 03:05:52.980]   "Abigail, I pooped today."
[03:05:52.980 --> 03:05:54.420]   And she's like, "Yeah, that's great.
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:55.340]   "You know, you should poop every day."
[03:05:55.340 --> 03:05:57.040]   And they're like, "No, no, no, you understand?
[03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:58.780]   "I pooped yesterday too."
[03:05:58.780 --> 03:06:03.180]   And it's the first time these kids have pooped consecutively.
[03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:04.580]   They don't poop regularly.
[03:06:04.580 --> 03:06:07.860]   And I think, again, if I'm just trying to get out
[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:10.580]   in the weeds and talk about what's normal and not normal,
[03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:13.060]   we should talk about you didn't eat fiber.
[03:06:13.060 --> 03:06:15.940]   And she's like, "Wait until you poop twice in one day."
[03:06:15.940 --> 03:06:17.440]   And they were like, "That's crazy.
[03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:19.060]   "I've never in my whole life."
[03:06:19.060 --> 03:06:21.540]   And what was the difference is they started eating fruits
[03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:22.940]   and vegetables and fiber.
[03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:25.700]   And when we start to create those benchmarks,
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:27.820]   it's a lot easier for me to see inputs and outputs.
[03:06:27.820 --> 03:06:29.540]   And then we can argue about,
[03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:31.780]   can you choke down a hundred grams of carbs an hour?
[03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.420]   'Cause you're my elite cyclist.
[03:06:33.420 --> 03:06:36.920]   I think you'd be shocked at how a lot of my athletes
[03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:39.100]   have changed their relationship around food
[03:06:39.100 --> 03:06:42.060]   because it serves their needs.
[03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:44.220]   It's not their identity around control.
[03:06:44.220 --> 03:06:46.580]   And something that Julie and I have been very cautious of
[03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:48.440]   is if you have two daughters, just speaking,
[03:06:48.440 --> 03:06:51.820]   we're really concerned about creating dysfunctional patterns
[03:06:51.820 --> 03:06:53.260]   or relationships to food,
[03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:56.860]   because in this fitness space, it can be real gnarly.
[03:06:56.860 --> 03:07:02.060]   - Yeah, I see the progression from sitcoms of the type
[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:05.700]   that we grew up on to reality TV shows, to social media,
[03:07:05.700 --> 03:07:10.100]   where social media can do so much good education-wise,
[03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:11.780]   et cetera, connection.
[03:07:11.780 --> 03:07:14.680]   But it's basically a reality TV show
[03:07:14.680 --> 03:07:16.660]   that everyone's been able to cast themselves in
[03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:18.060]   if they want.
[03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:21.640]   And certain characters are casting their physique.
[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:24.140]   Certain viewers are casting their outrageous behavior.
[03:07:24.140 --> 03:07:27.660]   And we're all in this reality TV show called social media.
[03:07:27.660 --> 03:07:30.180]   - I think that's really the best way to describe it.
[03:07:30.180 --> 03:07:31.700]   - When people start to feel like,
[03:07:31.700 --> 03:07:33.460]   oh, wow, these people are getting attention
[03:07:33.460 --> 03:07:34.780]   for this reason or that reason,
[03:07:34.780 --> 03:07:37.080]   it creates a gravitational pull
[03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:38.660]   toward people behaving a certain way.
[03:07:38.660 --> 03:07:40.620]   And then obviously some of that
[03:07:40.620 --> 03:07:42.180]   can be really self-destructive.
[03:07:42.180 --> 03:07:45.060]   - Do you win health?
[03:07:45.060 --> 03:07:46.620]   I mean, this is a great question I ask people.
[03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:50.940]   So like you shredded down super dysfunctional eating,
[03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:52.560]   can't go out and eat with friends.
[03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:54.580]   You don't drink anything with calories.
[03:07:54.580 --> 03:07:57.860]   Like it's really gnarly to be hyper lean.
[03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:00.180]   And then what I'll say is when you took your shirt off,
[03:08:00.180 --> 03:08:01.060]   did you win Instagram?
[03:08:01.060 --> 03:08:02.060]   Did you win?
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:04.820]   Because you got another 60, 70 years on this planet.
[03:08:04.820 --> 03:08:06.340]   How does that work?
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:07.380]   We don't really diet.
[03:08:07.380 --> 03:08:10.020]   We'll manipulate macros to take weight on
[03:08:10.020 --> 03:08:13.260]   or put weight off players in season, out of season.
[03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:14.820]   You know, we'll have really good athletes say,
[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:16.020]   I think I should lose four pounds
[03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:17.180]   the next two weeks for this thing.
[03:08:17.180 --> 03:08:18.700]   And I'm like, hold up.
[03:08:18.700 --> 03:08:20.820]   I'm not gonna put you in another stressor
[03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:22.280]   when we're trying to like,
[03:08:22.280 --> 03:08:24.660]   let's go ahead and talk about body composition
[03:08:24.660 --> 03:08:26.060]   after the season.
[03:08:26.060 --> 03:08:31.060]   But ultimately when we really get people on board
[03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:33.500]   with how food has the potential
[03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:35.620]   to enrich their relationships,
[03:08:35.620 --> 03:08:38.500]   how fun it is to cook, how fun it is to prep,
[03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:40.520]   how fun it is to serve other people,
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:42.780]   then we have this really different relationship
[03:08:42.780 --> 03:08:45.660]   with feeling and that's really remarkable.
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:48.140]   But it is really easy to say I won.
[03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:50.980]   And now I'm like, okay, so this 90 day fast,
[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:54.100]   there are so many fitness things out there
[03:08:54.100 --> 03:08:57.700]   where they start with a fast or brutal calorie restriction.
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:00.980]   And I'm like, that's your jam to get people lean fast
[03:09:00.980 --> 03:09:02.980]   is just to slam off the calories.
[03:09:02.980 --> 03:09:04.460]   We know what's gonna happen.
[03:09:04.460 --> 03:09:07.860]   How many people have done some kind of 30 day, 90 day thing
[03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:10.540]   and the next day it's like, they're off the rails.
[03:09:10.540 --> 03:09:12.540]   So if you're doing some body recomp
[03:09:12.540 --> 03:09:14.160]   and then you're off the rails for me,
[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:16.060]   I'm like, I don't think that was very good
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:19.020]   because this is a long season we're playing.
[03:09:19.020 --> 03:09:20.460]   - I think I have to be careful here
[03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:23.100]   because I realized this gets into some issues.
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:26.160]   When I did an episode about anorexia,
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:27.620]   I learned that first of all,
[03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:30.500]   anorexia has existed for centuries.
[03:09:30.500 --> 03:09:32.780]   This idea that it's more prominent now with social media,
[03:09:32.780 --> 03:09:34.420]   actually the numbers don't bear out.
[03:09:34.420 --> 03:09:38.020]   What does bear out is that it is the most deadly,
[03:09:38.020 --> 03:09:42.600]   the most deadly by far of all the psychiatric illnesses.
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:47.600]   It leads to death in a far greater percentage of cases
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:49.400]   than any other psychiatric illness,
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:51.860]   including bipolar where people often commit suicide,
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:55.780]   a much higher percentage of people commit suicide
[03:09:55.780 --> 03:09:57.760]   who are bipolar, et cetera.
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:00.220]   So it's a really serious thing.
[03:10:00.220 --> 03:10:04.180]   And yet we assume that social media has made that worse,
[03:10:04.180 --> 03:10:06.020]   but there's this now cluster
[03:10:06.020 --> 03:10:07.560]   of all these different eating disorders
[03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:10.260]   that don't qualify as full-blown anorexia nervosa,
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:11.460]   sort of like ADHD now,
[03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:13.500]   we understand people are having attention deficit issues
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:16.100]   that might not be clinical ADHD,
[03:10:16.100 --> 03:10:17.420]   but that cluster around it
[03:10:17.420 --> 03:10:19.580]   and like people's adults and children's inability
[03:10:19.580 --> 03:10:21.460]   to hold their attention on an idea or a topic
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:23.200]   for any appreciable amount of time.
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:24.580]   So it's a very serious thing.
[03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:27.740]   I love that today you've talked about
[03:10:27.740 --> 03:10:29.460]   enjoying your training,
[03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:32.060]   like really enjoying your training, all aspects,
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:33.580]   the resistance part, the cardiovascular part,
[03:10:33.580 --> 03:10:35.220]   the mobility part,
[03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:37.020]   in the evening, getting down on the floor,
[03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:40.860]   also enjoying eating with people, enjoying the sauna.
[03:10:40.860 --> 03:10:43.220]   I mean, I think people see the big guy that you are,
[03:10:43.220 --> 03:10:45.220]   the amazing track record you have
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:46.740]   of working with all these incredible athletes
[03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:49.340]   and you're quite accomplished athlete yourself.
[03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:52.100]   And I think this is the first time for me anyway,
[03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:55.380]   that I realized like you are thinking about
[03:10:55.380 --> 03:10:57.340]   how to make this whole thing pleasurable
[03:10:57.340 --> 03:10:58.740]   and mesh it with real life,
[03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:01.020]   which I'm realizing now shouldn't come as a surprise
[03:11:01.020 --> 03:11:03.340]   because you have a family, a flourishing family,
[03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:05.300]   in addition to a flourishing business
[03:11:05.300 --> 03:11:07.500]   with the ready state and so forth.
[03:11:07.500 --> 03:11:10.060]   I think if there's one message that really comes through
[03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:10.900]   over and over again today,
[03:11:10.900 --> 03:11:14.300]   it's like, how can you make fitness and nutrition
[03:11:14.300 --> 03:11:17.140]   and health part of your life,
[03:11:17.140 --> 03:11:19.300]   but not let it take over your life or your mind
[03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:20.960]   in a way that isn't healthy?
[03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:24.160]   Yeah, thank you for that.
[03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:25.580]   And if that's coming across at all,
[03:11:25.580 --> 03:11:28.140]   I think we're doing a better job.
[03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:29.860]   And I would say certainly tempered
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:31.700]   as I've gotten more reasonable.
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:33.420]   You know, I think we get older and you can see
[03:11:33.420 --> 03:11:35.260]   a little bit more of the horizon
[03:11:35.260 --> 03:11:37.300]   and you start to wrap your hands around,
[03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:39.100]   how are we going to solve these problems
[03:11:39.100 --> 03:11:42.340]   in these different places and what is sustainable?
[03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:44.180]   You know, I really think that that's,
[03:11:44.180 --> 03:11:47.060]   we see quick inputs and outputs
[03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:49.140]   that are high levels of sports performance.
[03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:52.620]   And simultaneously, again, I wanna take those lessons
[03:11:52.620 --> 03:11:55.760]   and transmute them to my own household
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:58.460]   in a really sustainable, fun way.
[03:11:58.460 --> 03:12:02.060]   The nutrition piece is such a dangerous one.
[03:12:02.060 --> 03:12:04.380]   And young right now, Julia and I are very obsessed
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:07.100]   with youth sports and spending time with seeing
[03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:10.060]   if we can improve that experience for families.
[03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:11.940]   So they come out unharmed.
[03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:16.420]   And, you know, REDS, Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport,
[03:12:16.420 --> 03:12:18.540]   you know, is where we start to see that kids
[03:12:18.540 --> 03:12:20.820]   are not eating enough to fuel activity
[03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:22.420]   and their growing body simultaneously.
[03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:24.780]   And it's really hard on their physiologies.
[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:27.420]   And it starts to show up with lost periods.
[03:12:27.420 --> 03:12:29.820]   It starts to show up with stress fractures, right?
[03:12:29.820 --> 03:12:31.420]   And we start to see sort of this,
[03:12:31.420 --> 03:12:35.300]   some degradation in sort of the body's tissues,
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:37.860]   but can really crash a lot of problems.
[03:12:37.860 --> 03:12:40.060]   And, you know, Stacy Sims is probably the first person
[03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:41.540]   to really put it on my radar of,
[03:12:41.540 --> 03:12:43.300]   hey, you're a physio coach.
[03:12:43.300 --> 03:12:45.740]   I need you to become an expert
[03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:47.020]   with the people that you're working with.
[03:12:47.020 --> 03:12:48.460]   You know, are you eating enough support?
[03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:51.740]   And I see some of the elite women I work with,
[03:12:51.740 --> 03:12:53.940]   elite women, really battle,
[03:12:53.940 --> 03:12:55.860]   this is what the body I need to get paid
[03:12:55.860 --> 03:12:57.340]   and to win world championships.
[03:12:57.340 --> 03:13:00.460]   And that's not the body that people want on the Instagram.
[03:13:00.460 --> 03:13:03.100]   And, you know, should I have a salad after this training?
[03:13:03.100 --> 03:13:04.500]   I'm like, we just played for three hours.
[03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:06.100]   No, you're not gonna eat a salad.
[03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:07.780]   I'm like, go get this big ass burrito.
[03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:10.380]   And then we'll talk about your salad next, you know?
[03:13:10.380 --> 03:13:13.140]   - So it sounds like the athletes are under eating.
[03:13:13.140 --> 03:13:16.020]   - Yes. - And my understanding anyway,
[03:13:16.020 --> 03:13:17.700]   the statistics- - Also under fueling,
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:18.820]   which I know is confusing,
[03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:22.160]   but, you know, potentially not thinking about food
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:23.620]   at the right times.
[03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:26.380]   - And within the general population of non-athletes,
[03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:27.640]   especially youth, however,
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:30.620]   it seems that people are over-consuming calories.
[03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:34.380]   So there seems to be two populations clustering out here.
[03:13:34.380 --> 03:13:36.980]   - This reminds me, we have a rule at our house for dinner.
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:39.140]   We have a three vegetable rule.
[03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:41.460]   This is from a woman we work with, Margaret Garvey,
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:44.100]   who cooks a protein, whatever that is,
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:45.900]   and has also three vegetables.
[03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:47.740]   And that's where she starts.
[03:13:47.740 --> 03:13:51.260]   And I have one daughter who is like a gourmet chef.
[03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:54.520]   Georgia is just a total bad-ass, you know, G.
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:55.360]   And then I have Caroline,
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:56.900]   who is the pickiest human being on the, like,
[03:13:56.900 --> 03:13:57.980]   "Is it brown? I'm not eating."
[03:13:57.980 --> 03:13:59.920]   You know, and she's getting better.
[03:13:59.920 --> 03:14:02.160]   But when we had three vegetables,
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:04.780]   suddenly what we saw was that she might eat one, right?
[03:14:04.780 --> 03:14:06.220]   And we could start to have exposure.
[03:14:06.220 --> 03:14:09.340]   But I think if we crowd out some of the,
[03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:12.220]   'cause we don't wanna have a restrictive house, right?
[03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:16.620]   But, you know, if we crowd out some of the other foods,
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:18.500]   we found that it was a lot easier for us to say,
[03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:19.780]   "This is what we're eating.
[03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:21.820]   And we eat this together as a family."
[03:14:21.820 --> 03:14:23.540]   And then if there's other foods,
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:25.060]   I mean, your teenagers are gonna leave the house
[03:14:25.060 --> 03:14:25.980]   and eat whatever they want.
[03:14:25.980 --> 03:14:26.980]   Just be clear, everybody.
[03:14:26.980 --> 03:14:29.940]   So you might as well stuff 'em with the good stuff at home.
[03:14:29.940 --> 03:14:34.180]   - I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about supplements.
[03:14:34.180 --> 03:14:37.300]   These days, we hear a lot about creatine.
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:38.980]   Creatine, creatine, creatine.
[03:14:38.980 --> 03:14:41.620]   I like creatine, been taking it for years.
[03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:42.840]   We'll occasionally do a washout
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:45.020]   where I just kind of let a bunch of water out of my body.
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:46.220]   Why not? And then get back to it.
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:47.860]   I don't do it for any specific reason.
[03:14:47.860 --> 03:14:48.700]   I just do it.
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:49.660]   - I travel and forget to bring creatines.
[03:14:49.660 --> 03:14:50.500]   I'm like, "Okay."
[03:14:50.500 --> 03:14:51.320]   - Yeah, but most of the time,
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:52.620]   I'm taking five to 10 grams a day.
[03:14:52.620 --> 03:14:55.020]   Okay, we've heard about the body benefits,
[03:14:55.020 --> 03:14:56.080]   the brain benefits.
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:00.380]   For athletes and just "exercisers,"
[03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:02.620]   the typical person listening to this podcast,
[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:04.580]   do you recommend creatine?
[03:15:04.580 --> 03:15:07.140]   What are some of the things that in your household,
[03:15:07.140 --> 03:15:09.060]   I'm getting this picture, and I've been in your home,
[03:15:09.060 --> 03:15:11.540]   and I will say that the spirit in your home
[03:15:11.540 --> 03:15:13.340]   is a wonderful one.
[03:15:13.340 --> 03:15:15.500]   Brian McKenzie and I showed up more or less unannounced
[03:15:15.500 --> 03:15:19.220]   at one point, and it's a delightful thing.
[03:15:19.220 --> 03:15:20.540]   Like, people's spirits are up.
[03:15:20.540 --> 03:15:21.660]   - It's a space station.
[03:15:21.660 --> 03:15:23.660]   It's a space station of stoke.
[03:15:23.660 --> 03:15:25.820]   And if you want to be part of it, you can come in.
[03:15:25.820 --> 03:15:26.660]   - Thank you.
[03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:28.740]   It's a great environment,
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:30.980]   and it was very warming to see that
[03:15:30.980 --> 03:15:32.180]   and the way that you embrace
[03:15:32.180 --> 03:15:34.060]   all these different aspects of life.
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:36.000]   It's busy, and it's hectic, and it's fun,
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:37.440]   and people care for one another,
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:38.800]   and they're direct with one another,
[03:15:38.800 --> 03:15:40.100]   but in a way that's really supportive.
[03:15:40.100 --> 03:15:43.340]   It's really, in my mind, a great model for a home,
[03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:45.220]   and it's really, it stayed with me,
[03:15:45.220 --> 03:15:46.620]   and it's really a pleasure to reflect on it.
[03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:47.540]   - High five, J-Star.
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:50.460]   Yeah, it's a team effort in there for sure.
[03:15:50.460 --> 03:15:53.900]   So, I'll just ask this.
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:57.460]   What supplements do you think are,
[03:15:57.460 --> 03:16:00.300]   if not necessary, then highly desirable for most people,
[03:16:00.300 --> 03:16:01.460]   and then for athletes?
[03:16:01.460 --> 03:16:03.100]   And maybe, 'cause we get this question a lot now,
[03:16:03.100 --> 03:16:05.140]   especially after Stacey came on the podcast,
[03:16:05.140 --> 03:16:08.740]   for the female athletes you work with in particular,
[03:16:08.740 --> 03:16:12.540]   are there supplements that add on to that initial batch?
[03:16:12.540 --> 03:16:14.940]   - So, I think we can divide these things
[03:16:14.940 --> 03:16:18.980]   like into food-like things, right?
[03:16:18.980 --> 03:16:19.820]   And then sort of performance.
[03:16:19.820 --> 03:16:22.420]   - Yeah, like whey protein is just a protein replacement.
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:26.500]   High quality, high protein to calorie ratio.
[03:16:26.500 --> 03:16:28.500]   - That's right, and if you don't handle whey,
[03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:29.460]   like my athletes, I'm like,
[03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:31.100]   "Let me introduce you to these vegetarian proteins."
[03:16:31.100 --> 03:16:33.460]   And that's because you're having a hard time
[03:16:33.460 --> 03:16:35.860]   timing your meals or just getting enough protein,
[03:16:35.860 --> 03:16:37.540]   'cause sometimes you just don't feel like it.
[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:39.600]   So, great, great utilization there.
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:45.220]   For Caroline, she gets omegas at night,
[03:16:45.220 --> 03:16:46.260]   'cause she doesn't wanna have
[03:16:46.260 --> 03:16:48.380]   any accidental fish burp at school.
[03:16:48.380 --> 03:16:51.180]   She's a teenager, so she takes 'em before she goes to bed.
[03:16:51.180 --> 03:16:54.060]   And we're really interested in brain health.
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:56.580]   And there's some early research,
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:16:58.060]   and again, not my expertise,
[03:16:58.060 --> 03:17:00.980]   that I've heard of, read about, talked to people about,
[03:17:00.980 --> 03:17:03.780]   that vitamin D, creatine, and omegas
[03:17:03.780 --> 03:17:06.780]   might help attenuate symptoms of concussion
[03:17:06.780 --> 03:17:08.420]   if they get hit, right?
[03:17:08.420 --> 03:17:11.780]   So, post, pre, so those things are on Caroline.
[03:17:11.780 --> 03:17:14.140]   She gets creatine every day, she gets an omega every day,
[03:17:14.140 --> 03:17:15.580]   and she gets vitamin D.
[03:17:15.580 --> 03:17:17.180]   And some of that is,
[03:17:17.180 --> 03:17:19.140]   probably gets enough vitamin D during the summer,
[03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:20.820]   'cause I could pull it out,
[03:17:20.820 --> 03:17:23.980]   but we live in northern climes, and they're indoors,
[03:17:23.980 --> 03:17:25.980]   and there's good research.
[03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:27.580]   I think Dan Garner had a great piece
[03:17:27.580 --> 03:17:30.420]   just talking about vitamin D supplementation in the military
[03:17:30.420 --> 03:17:34.420]   and the decrease of risk of fractures in the foot
[03:17:34.420 --> 03:17:35.760]   just with vitamin D.
[03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:38.260]   So, that's the start for me.
[03:17:38.660 --> 03:17:40.300]   I take a good multi,
[03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:42.900]   because I'm like, I'm just gonna cover the bases, you know?
[03:17:42.900 --> 03:17:46.380]   And then you can look,
[03:17:46.380 --> 03:17:48.980]   I think the next sort of valence of interest is,
[03:17:48.980 --> 03:17:49.820]   have you had a blood panel?
[03:17:49.820 --> 03:17:51.620]   How are your vitamin B levels?
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:52.900]   Is there anything we need to do
[03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:54.660]   based on your environment or your genetics?
[03:17:54.660 --> 03:17:58.740]   And then I think it gets real in the weeds past that.
[03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:01.740]   And again, play around with that.
[03:18:01.740 --> 03:18:04.380]   One of my super smart friends was like,
[03:18:04.380 --> 03:18:06.820]   I think you should take a statin,
[03:18:06.820 --> 03:18:09.940]   a small dose statin once a week.
[03:18:09.940 --> 03:18:11.460]   And I was like, all right.
[03:18:11.460 --> 03:18:13.620]   So, I was like, better take some CoQ10 with that.
[03:18:13.620 --> 03:18:15.220]   It's an experiment I'm running, right?
[03:18:15.220 --> 03:18:17.380]   Downsides are low, I'm getting my blood panels,
[03:18:17.380 --> 03:18:18.820]   talk to my physician.
[03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:21.020]   But so, CoQ10 is on the menu for me,
[03:18:21.020 --> 03:18:22.420]   just to make sure I don't have anything.
[03:18:22.420 --> 03:18:26.140]   And so, I think suddenly what we should be looking at is,
[03:18:26.140 --> 03:18:29.100]   how do I round out, my family doesn't eat fish,
[03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:30.780]   so we're not getting enough sort of omegas
[03:18:30.780 --> 03:18:33.580]   from those sources, and no one will eat walnuts,
[03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:34.660]   but I'm the only one eating walnuts.
[03:18:34.660 --> 03:18:37.260]   So, how do I round out my nutrition
[03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:38.940]   with some supplementation?
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.740]   And is there a benefit for some other things
[03:18:41.740 --> 03:18:44.980]   that with my genetics or with what's going on,
[03:18:44.980 --> 03:18:49.980]   like JSTAR has a mutated MTHFR gene, right?
[03:18:49.980 --> 03:18:55.300]   And so, we're always watching B vitamins for her, right?
[03:18:55.300 --> 03:18:56.540]   So, because we know that. - Poor methylator.
[03:18:56.540 --> 03:18:57.740]   - Right, poor methylator, exactly right.
[03:18:57.740 --> 03:18:58.740]   - JSTAR is his wife.
[03:18:58.740 --> 03:19:01.740]   - That's right, sorry, JSTISL, CEO.
[03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:03.460]   - You guys have such an awesome relationship.
[03:19:03.460 --> 03:19:05.300]   You guys have poked fun at one another,
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.180]   you're clearly awesome companions to one another,
[03:19:08.180 --> 03:19:10.100]   and you do great, great work together.
[03:19:10.100 --> 03:19:12.700]   - I am the broken anchor of the relationship, I like to say.
[03:19:12.700 --> 03:19:17.420]   She is, you know, what's really interesting is I have,
[03:19:17.420 --> 03:19:19.860]   I'm a little bit like you, I think I'm excitable.
[03:19:19.860 --> 03:19:22.180]   I get obsessed with things, it's super fun,
[03:19:22.180 --> 03:19:24.660]   go down rabbit holes, I like to experiment.
[03:19:24.660 --> 03:19:27.420]   And JSTAR is like the true North,
[03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:30.220]   like, no, that sounds fishy, we're not doing that.
[03:19:30.220 --> 03:19:31.820]   You know, like I came home one time
[03:19:31.820 --> 03:19:34.220]   and I was like, you know what,
[03:19:34.220 --> 03:19:35.660]   this cow's milk is out of here.
[03:19:35.660 --> 03:19:37.580]   Our family's only drinking goat milk.
[03:19:37.580 --> 03:19:39.580]   I only had the best goat milk, I just had the best goat milk.
[03:19:39.580 --> 03:19:41.860]   And Juliet was like, sure, that's gonna last.
[03:19:41.860 --> 03:19:43.620]   And I gave some goat milk to Georgia
[03:19:43.620 --> 03:19:45.660]   and she's like hucked it across the room, she's a baby.
[03:19:45.660 --> 03:19:48.140]   And then I drank the goat milk and like vomited
[03:19:48.140 --> 03:19:50.340]   into the sink and I had goat milk on my lip.
[03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:53.340]   And Juliet just is so patient by saying,
[03:19:53.340 --> 03:19:55.340]   huh, I wonder if that's a good idea.
[03:19:55.340 --> 03:19:57.420]   I wonder if we'll stick around, so.
[03:19:57.420 --> 03:19:58.580]   - So she's the rudder.
[03:19:58.580 --> 03:19:59.900]   - She is 100% the rudder.
[03:19:59.900 --> 03:20:01.700]   She is a three-time world champion, everyone.
[03:20:01.700 --> 03:20:05.140]   She's a rower at Cal and she is my training partner.
[03:20:05.140 --> 03:20:06.820]   She's the greatest training partner I've ever had.
[03:20:06.820 --> 03:20:09.620]   We use training as another way of spending time together.
[03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:10.860]   - I love it.
[03:20:10.860 --> 03:20:12.860]   Thanks for sharing a little bit of the picture of your home.
[03:20:12.860 --> 03:20:14.740]   It matches exactly my experience.
[03:20:14.740 --> 03:20:15.580]   - Chaos.
[03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:20.580]   - And chaos, a little bit of chaos and a ton of love.
[03:20:20.580 --> 03:20:23.420]   And I've been quoting him a lot lately.
[03:20:23.420 --> 03:20:24.900]   I cannot take any credit for this,
[03:20:24.900 --> 03:20:29.900]   but Naval, who's, you know, famous on various podcasts.
[03:20:30.620 --> 03:20:33.780]   He says, you know, what are we really shooting for in life?
[03:20:33.780 --> 03:20:37.880]   It's a fit, energetic body.
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:39.260]   This is Naval, not me, by the way.
[03:20:39.260 --> 03:20:44.260]   He said fit, energetic body, a calm mind and resources.
[03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:48.380]   We gotta have resources and a home full of love.
[03:20:48.380 --> 03:20:52.100]   So I don't know from, you know, that's the list.
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:53.620]   - Spend the rest of your life working on those
[03:20:53.620 --> 03:20:56.200]   and you're gonna have a really, it's gonna be really fun.
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:59.140]   And I just wanna remind people, you hear me say it again,
[03:20:59.140 --> 03:21:03.460]   that this should all be enjoyable and it is fun to track.
[03:21:03.460 --> 03:21:06.740]   It's also, you know, which devices am I wearing right now?
[03:21:06.740 --> 03:21:09.140]   I'm not wearing a single device, you know,
[03:21:09.140 --> 03:21:11.580]   'cause I wanna feel and sometimes I track
[03:21:11.580 --> 03:21:13.220]   and sometimes I don't track.
[03:21:13.220 --> 03:21:14.060]   How am I feeling?
[03:21:14.060 --> 03:21:16.940]   And ultimately everything is really coming down to
[03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:20.300]   how do I come to understand my own process
[03:21:20.300 --> 03:21:22.860]   and my interaction with the world process?
[03:21:22.860 --> 03:21:25.140]   I think I'm getting better at 51
[03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:27.580]   of knowing I don't need six cookies
[03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:29.660]   and I really need to get more fruits and vegetables
[03:21:29.660 --> 03:21:32.820]   and sleep, and I don't need a device to tell me that.
[03:21:32.820 --> 03:21:34.420]   - Love it.
[03:21:34.420 --> 03:21:37.820]   Well, Kelly, Dr. Starrett,
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:39.940]   thank you so much for coming on here today
[03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:41.660]   and sharing with us so much wisdom.
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:43.460]   We covered so much, you covered so much.
[03:21:43.460 --> 03:21:47.540]   I mean, pelvic floor fascia, cold heat, movement patterns.
[03:21:47.540 --> 03:21:49.060]   You give us a ton of practical tools,
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:52.100]   getting down on the floor, sit stand and on and on.
[03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:56.620]   But a small portal into the vast amount of knowledge
[03:21:56.620 --> 03:21:57.740]   you have in that head of yours.
[03:21:57.740 --> 03:21:59.820]   And I just have to say that, you know,
[03:21:59.820 --> 03:22:03.380]   it's been a delight today because these little bits
[03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:05.660]   have come through about who I know you to be
[03:22:05.660 --> 03:22:07.740]   in the rest of the world.
[03:22:07.740 --> 03:22:08.580]   This is the real world.
[03:22:08.580 --> 03:22:10.020]   We just happen to have microphones in front of us,
[03:22:10.020 --> 03:22:11.140]   the rest of the world.
[03:22:11.140 --> 03:22:12.780]   And you've been at this a while,
[03:22:12.780 --> 03:22:16.580]   this business of trying to help people figure out
[03:22:16.580 --> 03:22:19.340]   best ways to move, how to be a better athlete,
[03:22:19.340 --> 03:22:21.620]   how to, you know, improve one's fitness,
[03:22:21.620 --> 03:22:26.260]   how to take a rational, fun, hardworking approach at times,
[03:22:26.260 --> 03:22:28.700]   but also fun, playful, recreational approach
[03:22:28.700 --> 03:22:31.940]   to this really key aspect of our health
[03:22:31.940 --> 03:22:33.380]   and many key aspects of our health.
[03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:35.740]   So I just want to thank you for coming here today,
[03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:37.500]   for doing the work that you do.
[03:22:37.500 --> 03:22:41.220]   And, you know, you are one of the real ones, as they say.
[03:22:41.220 --> 03:22:42.860]   - Oh, my brother, thank you so much.
[03:22:42.860 --> 03:22:44.340]   - And you walk the walk.
[03:22:44.340 --> 03:22:46.860]   You're strong, you can go far, you have fun doing it.
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:49.580]   You're a great husband and dad,
[03:22:49.580 --> 03:22:51.220]   and you've been a great friend to me.
[03:22:51.220 --> 03:22:53.100]   So thanks for coming on here.
[03:22:53.100 --> 03:22:54.620]   Let's get you back again.
[03:22:54.620 --> 03:22:56.780]   And just thanks for being you.
[03:22:56.780 --> 03:22:57.820]   - My pleasure, any time.
[03:22:57.820 --> 03:23:00.380]   And thanks to all the great Huberman,
[03:23:00.380 --> 03:23:01.500]   people that make this thing possible.
[03:23:01.500 --> 03:23:03.460]   It's really a thing.
[03:23:03.460 --> 03:23:04.300]   Thanks for brother.
[03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:05.180]   - Thank you.
[03:23:05.180 --> 03:23:07.060]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:23:07.060 --> 03:23:08.460]   with Dr. Kelly Starrett.
[03:23:08.460 --> 03:23:09.860]   To learn more about Kelly Starrett
[03:23:09.860 --> 03:23:11.300]   and the work that he does with his wife,
[03:23:11.300 --> 03:23:13.340]   Juliet Starrett at The Ready State,

[03:23:22.660 --> 03:23:25.100]   of exercise physiology and the protocols
[03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:26.620]   that can best serve you in your fitness,
[03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:28.100]   athletic and other goals,

[03:23:41.300 --> 03:23:43.380]   who is a true world expert in this topic.
[03:23:43.380 --> 03:23:46.180]   And it covers all the things you could possibly imagine
[03:23:46.180 --> 03:23:48.400]   related to fitness and exercise
[03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:50.860]   to meet your fitness and exercise goals.

[03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:21.760]   I do read all the comments.
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:22.900]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:24:22.900 --> 03:24:24.100]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:24:24.100 --> 03:24:25.700]   It's my very first book.
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:27.140]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:24:27.140 --> 03:24:29.260]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:24:29.260 --> 03:24:30.460]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:31.580]   for more than five years,
[03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:33.940]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:24:33.940 --> 03:24:35.460]   of research and experience.
[03:24:35.460 --> 03:24:38.540]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:41.020]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:43.460]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:46.860]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:24:46.860 --> 03:24:48.940]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:24:48.940 --> 03:24:52.820]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:24:52.820 --> 03:24:55.160]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:24:56.960]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:24:56.960 --> 03:24:58.720]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:01.440]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:03.440]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:06.360]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:09.320]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:11.120]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:12.260]   And on all those platforms,
[03:25:12.260 --> 03:25:14.380]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:25:14.380 --> 03:25:15.880]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:17.320]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:19.420]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:20.720]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:24.380]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:25:24.380 --> 03:25:25.560]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:27.120]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:28.640]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:30.600]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:32.000]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.200]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[03:25:34.200 --> 03:25:36.200]   one-to-three-page PDFs.
[03:25:36.200 --> 03:25:38.480]   Those one-to-three-page PDFs cover things like
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:40.720]   deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:42.760]   We have a foundational fitness protocol.
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:45.120]   We also have protocols for optimizing your sleep,
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:46.400]   dopamine, and much more.
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:48.760]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:51.880]   Simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the Menu tab,
[03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:54.200]   scroll down to Newsletter, and provide your email.
[03:25:54.200 --> 03:25:56.600]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:57.880]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:00.560]   for today's discussion with Dr. Kelly Starrett.
[03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:02.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:04.980]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:07.560]   [upbeat music]
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:10.140]   (upbeat music)
