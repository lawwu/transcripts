[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Lately, you've been talking a lot about New Calvinism, Pastor John, a phrase which appears
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.680]   to have been coined back in 2007 or 2008 by Crossway Books titling committee, as they
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.120]   were thinking about subtitles for Colin Hansen's book, Young, Restless, Reformed, a journalist's
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.960]   journey with the New Calvinists. And the phrase was born. And it's a phrase that has become
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.060]   part of our vocabulary over the years since. And obviously, this New Calvinism is built
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.440]   on a long legacy of Old Calvinism. So explain this further for us. And in your mind, Pastor
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.720]   John, what's new about New Calvinism?
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.320]   Well, the first thing I would say is that what the New Calvinism has in common with
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.640]   the Older Calvinism is a thousand times more important than what makes it different. That's
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.520]   the most important thing to say, probably. The truth is not new, and the truth is the
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.900]   root and the ground of all the applications, new and old. But the doctrines of grace, summed
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.240]   up into five points, the five soul laws of the Reformation, the sovereignty of God over
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.760]   all our suffering, the supremacy of an infallible scriptures, overall tradition, all these are
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.080]   common and supremely precious, old and new. That's the first thing I would say. The commonalities
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   that define the truth dimension of Calvinism, old and new, are vastly more important than
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.200]   the distinctions. Here's the second thing I'd say. Any attempt to describe the New Calvinism
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.440]   as distinct from the old is almost certainly going to run into historical contradictions,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.200]   because the Older Calvinism goes back so far, so many centuries, and has found expression
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.120]   in hundreds of different forms and cultures and emphases and strategies and personalities.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:18.440]   As soon as you say such and such is new, someone with a good historical nose is going to find
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.520]   an example in history that shows it's not new. And so I'm not eager to claim newness.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.960]   And the third thing to say is, well, you are using the term, Piper, so come on. Why are
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.760]   you using it then? What is new about the New Calvinism if you're going to keep using the
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   term? And so here's, I jotted down seven things that I think we can say give good warrant
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.760]   to the term New Calvinism. Number one, the New Calvinism has a strong complementarian
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.320]   flavor with an emphasis on the flourishing of men and women in relationships where men
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.520]   embrace the call to robust, humble, Christ-like servant leadership. Now that has been true
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:21.480]   for 99% of Reformed people and Reformed history. And the only reason it stands out as new is
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.760]   because in the last 50 years, many Reformed people have turned away from that part of
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.240]   the history. And so ironically, in being a conserving element at this point, the New
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   Calvinism looks new over against a lot of the trajectories of the older Calvinism that
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.920]   have become egalitarian. Number two, the New Calvinism feels new because so much of it
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.840]   embraces contemporary forms of music and worship. In principle, that's not new. Isaac Watts
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.640]   in the 1700s was quite avant-garde in his hymnology, but it feels new because there
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.600]   are strong traditions of Calvinism who resist this trend. Number three, there is a strong
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.320]   Baptistic element in the New Calvinism. Now, historically, Baptists have been mainly Calvinistic
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:32.220]   over the entire history of their life from the 17th century, but they have seemed like
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.000]   stepchildren historically, and today they don't, and that feels new. Fourth, the New
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.560]   Calvinism includes significant numbers of Charismatics and Non-Charismatics. Historically,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.000]   that's new. Number five, in the New Calvinism, Jonathan Edwards seems to play a historically
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.920]   unusually large role over against, say, John Calvin on the historical spectrum. That's
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:13.880]   a newer development. Number six, the New Calvinism is vibrantly engaged in the world of internet
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.400]   with hundreds of energetic bloggers and social media activists and Twitter users. Now, that's
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.320]   totally new. I mean, that just didn't exist, and it's no fault of the older Calvinism because
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.040]   there was no opportunity to use it. Number seven, there is a strong emphasis in the New
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:43.240]   Calvinism on multi-ethnicity of the church and a passion for racial harmony and diversity,
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.920]   and even more amazing, the convictions of God's sovereignty, this big God theology,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.880]   for breaking out in ethnically indigenous ways that have not been managed by anyone
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:11.400]   on the earth. And I think, historically speaking, the scope of that diversity is probably new.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.760]   So those are my seven, I think that was seven, marks of newness. But I'll end again by saying
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.480]   again what the new has in common with the old is all important. Truth is always the
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.520]   root that can break out again and again in new ways from generation to generation, and
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   holding fast to that, spreading that is what I care most about.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.920]   Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John. And speaking of New Calvinism, where did all these Calvinists
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.440]   come from? That was the question. That was the topic of our discussion in episode number
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   237 in the Ask Pastor John podcast series. Find episode number 237 along with 300 other
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.840]   episodes in the Ask Pastor John app, which is a free download for the iPhone and the
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.080]   Android. And in the iPhone version of the app, we recently added a search bar at the
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.520]   top of the screen, which makes it really easy and convenient to navigate the entire podcast
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   archive.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.480]   Tomorrow, we will return to talk about the prosperity gospel again, specifically how
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.780]   to discern a subtler version of the prosperity gospel message that can creep into the sermons
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.120]   that we hear today. I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you tomorrow.
