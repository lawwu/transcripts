[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360]   I'll take it off because it's true
[00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.840]   that once you get used to this feeling
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.400]   of not having the pull,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.920]   it's like there's been a rope around your neck that's gone.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   It's a feeling of freedom.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.960]   First, it's stressful.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.920]   It's like stressful to think like, what am I missing?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.000]   And so I do have this pretty solid bedrock knowledge
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   that you can survive.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.200]   Like you can be an effective person
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.040]   without having access to your email or Slack
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.240]   or the internet or whatever, like at any moment of the day.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.060]   Like the world can operate.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.240]   They created the iPhone without an iPhone.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120]   It's possible to do all kinds of wonderful things,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.480]   but that feeling at first is stressful.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360]   And then maybe the next feeling is boredom.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.480]   Another manifestation of boredom is that time slows down.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.400]   You actually get more lifetime
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.480]   because your time is going a little bit slower.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720]   I found that it slows down in a really good way
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.920]   when we create barriers.
