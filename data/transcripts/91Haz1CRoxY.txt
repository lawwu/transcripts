[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   welcome welcome everyone i'm joe i'm from the startups team here at anthropic and we're so
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.640]   thrilled to have all of you here today we have a breakout of six amazing founders that have really
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.080]   found product market fit building on cloud across a bunch of different industries across agentic
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.840]   coding across design across music generation and a lot of these startups have really seen that
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.840]   zero to multi-million user journey within the past 12 months and i know in this crowd there's a lot of
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.280]   you know really great founders too and so we want all of you to stay until the end of the session
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.760]   we have a little surprise for all of you to be able to spin up quicker uh on claude four um in
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.360]   our new family of models so without further ado i want to bring up kevin uh who is the ceo and
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.120]   co-founder of tempo labs awesome thanks joe everyone nice to meet you as she mentioned
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.600]   my name is kevin one of the co-founders of tempo and it's an honor to be here i'm to kick off i
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:27.040]   have a video uh that'll give you a little bit of a taste of what temple is all about
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   so
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   awesome so uh what is tempo at tempo we're building cursor for pms and designers uh tempo is a new type of
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   ide that feels more like a design tool like figma than it does vs code and the whole idea behind it is to
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.440]   to give designers and pms the ability to collaborate with claude uh and to create you know the first
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.040]   draft of pull requests and in many cases uh the actual end-to-end pull request uh kind of pulling the
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.360]   engineer out of the loop in some cases but if anything making the process of working on code
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.280]   collaborative as it stands today it's really non-engineers don't you know collaborate too much
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.000]   on code so i'll show you a bit of a live demo of what that looks like uh this is tempo uh tempo as you can tell
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   uh you know has three tabs product uh a prd tab a design tab and a code tab so imagine you're a pm right
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   you generate uh airbnb app with uh claude and you're like okay great this looks you know it's a it's a it's
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.480]   a quick and dirty prototype demo uh and then you pass it off to your designer and your designer looks at
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.560]   uh the real airbnb and it's kind of like hmm this is kind of off i need to get it pixel perfect so uh you come in
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.160]   in here and you realize that uh you know you spent some time working on this new animated uh tabs header
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   so you can see you know just like the it's nice and pretty just like the core uh airbnb uh so what i
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.120]   can do now is i can uh drag and drop this right into my header over here uh give that a second there you
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   go we've got it in the header uh and then what i can do is just rearrange this to get it in the middle
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.120]   um and again every change that i'm making is actually you know you can see editing the original
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.920]   source code in the correct position um so okay so we're kind of like starting to make some progress
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.760]   now clearly these little new badges are not great you know whenever whoever designed or created that
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.720]   didn't do a great job so why don't we fix that up really quick um so i'm going to open up my uh dom
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   tree over here which shows me everything that's in the dom i'll find the new badge and i'll just click
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.440]   delete just like i would boom okay we're getting somewhere close looks you know half decent now
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.040]   let's compare to airbnb okay we've got some work to do clearly claude thought we need this little
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.800]   text header i'm just going to delete that like i normally would in a design tool traditional design
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.960]   tool like figma i'm going to delete this over here and then i am going to let's compare again
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:47.280]   i'm going to move my uh the ellen to my property grid here to the center i'm going to add a little bit
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   of gap between them and then maybe here i'm going to remove this uh tailwind padding and then i'm going
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.520]   to compare to core airbnb and then the site that i built in tempo and now you get an idea of how you know
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.920]   pms designers can collaborate together with claude and then again i can enter a commit message push
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.680]   this to uh to github and actually the really cool thing is that this actually this code isn't running
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.520]   locally on my machine it's actually running on a docker container in the cloud so this whole thing is
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.280]   collaborative i can send a link to someone just like figma and they can come and collaboratively code
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.120]   with me and with claude there you go tempo is again it's an ide for designers and developers uh to
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.400]   collaborate together on code we already have a number of customers and have been growing extremely extremely
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   quickly uh and what we're seeing for customers that adopt tempo is designers truly are turning into
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.800]   design engineers and we're seeing that you know approximately 10 to 15 percent of front-end pull
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.520]   requests are actually being able to be opened by designers directly they're often able to do pixel
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.480]   pushing themselves without involving an engineer they can just work with tempo and with claude directly
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.600]   and in in about 60 percent of pull requests we see that a a sizable chunk of the front-end code has
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   been generated by designers by pms and by claude and it actually accelerates it's useful code that
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.920]   accelerates a true front-end engineer uh in their process of going to production and so that's tempo
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.680]   we are in the we're imminently about to release support for claude 4 so i invite you all to uh give it a
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280]   shot uh and uh empower your pms and your designers to start to collaborate with your engineers on code thank you
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   howdy everybody um my name is andrew file i will start uh with a little bit of a past history i build
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.800]   and sold software business for more than two billion dollars so i ran a team of more than thousand people
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.360]   and despite doing that i could tell that only about two to five percent of our ideas ever came to life
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.280]   because the majority of the time we spend on fairly routine work and the larger is the company the more of
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.600]   that routine is in your uh kind of uh the the bigger that routine makes part of your of your day job so
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   i fundamentally believe that uh we can automate at least 90 percent of that routine work giving
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.200]   us opportunity to move 10 times faster and bring more of our ideas to life and um i personally uh believe
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.680]   that a lot of their of this transformation will happen this year and we're uh actually observing it
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.120]   as we speak including today i think that uh this week actually demark demarks their transition into the
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.080]   next generation so how only 12 months ago the whole industry was on the first generation of ai coding
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.240]   assistance so a code completion it kind of uh was a very nice convenience but not a game changer to to
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:38.720]   anybody and then october last year um thanks to entropic we got um cloud 3.5 and that was a game
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.280]   changer and that allowed um us and zencoder and uh cursor and windsurf and a lot of other players to
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:52.160]   build true coding agents inside of your id so that opened up a completely new uh use cases completely new
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.360]   scenarios we saw usage skyrocket uh 10x 100x and we saw people uh being able to do amazing things that they
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.240]   haven't been able to do before and part of that revolution was um the model support for tools
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.640]   and environment because behind a lot of those generational changes there are some technical
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   capabilities that kind of unlock all of that right uh there was also move in the models from coding
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.800]   quote unquote like olympiad style stuff to true software engineering and that was uh very very very
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.880]   important and then uh obviously context matters um software repositories are quite large so it's good to
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.400]   to have a larger support and i think that uh in this year we'll actually see transition to the next
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.240]   generation uh for me one of the biggest enablers there is verification uh so i'm super excited about
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.520]   something that we haven't yet talked uh at this conference today is computer use we saw rapid progress
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.760]   in those models and they allow us to build uh proper verification and verification is key to scaling
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.560]   ai uh and kind of delivering more fully autonomous cycle and then the other thing is uh in real life in actual
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.200]   uh production work uh where you got multiple people engaged and multiple teams engaged uh typically
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.280]   a lot of the time is wasted doing what i call in between uh kind of passing the ball and so when we
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.800]   think about the problem we think about software development life cycle as a whole uh not just about the
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:23.520]   coding and that's a big part of our dna and so super happy to announce a couple of weeks ago
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.400]   uh came with zen agents so taking that concept of um coding agent and extending into custom agents that
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.360]   you can share across your whole organization with full support for mcp with specialized coding tools
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.400]   and whatnot but you can basically deploy them across your whole sdlc from their uh work on your prd
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:50.880]   to to the actual coding to verification to code reviews and whatnot so that's super exciting and i'll just
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:58.560]   basically show you a quick video and we'll be good to go
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:28.320]   and we're looking forward for entropic to bring us mcp
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.560]   registry uh but while that's not available we offer you ours so we got a hundred um i believe
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.320]   about 100 mcp servers out there and obviously you can configure your own and also as we launched that
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.920]   zen agents we were excited to launch the community aspects of it so there's an uh mit licensed github
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.200]   repo where you can commit your agents and if we approve your pr uh everybody will will see them so
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   we're excited and think that that can help kickstart the creativity process in a lot of organizations and
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.560]   kind of take it beyond the basic coding use uh truly across the whole software development life cycle so
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.440]   thank you all
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.880]   hi my name is jordan i'm the head of ai engineering at gamma and at gamma our mission is to help bring your
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:20.400]   ideas to life whether that's presentations documents websites or even social media carousels we do all this
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.640]   so we can help us through ai to help build these things for you
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.680]   and we love quad uh throughout gamma's kind of history of using ai there's been
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:36.480]   two moments where a model upgrade has made significant impact to our key metrics around user
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.560]   satisfaction for deck generation the first was when sonnet 3.5 came out and the second was when
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.320]   sonnet 3.7 came out we actually saw an eight percent increase in this metric which is something that we
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.440]   spent hundreds of hours trying to prompt engineer around and could not get such improvements
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:00.080]   and one of the big reasons for this was around web search so the built-in tool in sonnet that we can
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   natively use web search for and not have to use the third-party service
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.600]   so i'm going to show you the difference what web search made in gamma by showing two decks generated
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:16.480]   with gamma one with web search and one without so this is gamma gamma used ai to generate this it used
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:24.320]   sonnet 3.7 but it did not use web search and as you can see got a lot of things wrong this conference
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.280]   isn't january 22nd 2025 it's not three days i don't think these are the right speakers
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:41.440]   so let's see what we can do with web search so in gamma you can create a entire presentation web page
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:49.120]   document anything from a single sentence so i'll type in code with claude conference 2025
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.800]   and it's going to first create an outline for me it's going to search the web to figure out what
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   should be in this outline and it will inevitably find details about the code with claude conference
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.240]   and put them there so as you can see we're already off to a better start where we have the correct dates
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:16.400]   we have real technical sessions we have the right location so this looks much better for us
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.160]   and i've even gone ahead and created an an anthropic theme that we can use
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   so now that we have the outline generated gamma will take that outline and it will take the other
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.600]   information it has and create an entire presentation for us with hopefully the correct details so let's check
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   so i think already we're off to a better start it has the right date has the right location
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.720]   it tells us the schedule
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:05.520]   and overall this provides us a much better starting point if we were to say make a presentation or a
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.400]   website about this conference it's not going to be perfect but it'll get you to a point where you have
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.640]   the correct information and you're at a good starting point to actually finish your presentation
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:25.200]   so this one change from sonnet 3.5 to 3.7 with with web search was a huge lift for us
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.320]   and we're very excited to continue to use claude and to continue to see these improvements
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.320]   lastly we are hiring so if you are an engineer or product or designer and are interested in working
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.880]   at gamma you can go to careers.gamma.app thank you hi my name is amar goyal i'm the ceo and co-founder
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.520]   of bitto we're building the hopefully the world's best ai code review platform
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:15:00.000]   so as we all know we're using all these cursor windsurf cloud cloud code to write massive massive
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.240]   amounts of code the amount of code that developers are writing we think is going to go up 10x over the
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.560]   next year or two but what that means is that you know vibe coding which we all talk about does not
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:17.040]   equal vibe engineering how do you get code that's scalable reliable performant fits into your architectural
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.920]   design patterns and that's still left to the code review process but code review is not going to
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.320]   scale teams have trouble keeping up today it's not going to scale for 10x the amount of code
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.240]   bitto's built an ai code review that plugs into github gitlab bitbucket works with over 50 languages
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.920]   our focus is really especially with sonnet having a really high quality model that provides a human-like
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.360]   code review focuses on the critical things our biggest thing is really about more signal and less
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.640]   noise how do we provide you actionable important suggestions let me show it to you so we've got a
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:58.240]   pr here this is gitlab that works kind of the same in all the platforms so once you create a pr
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:05.360]   bitto's fired bitto gets called and we first start by summarizing your pr this doesn't require
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.640]   any documentation or any comments we just look at the diffs we look at your code and we summarize it
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.400]   then we give you a quick kind of overview of what we found in the pr so here we found three
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:22.880]   actionable suggestions some things about missing resources a cache implementation that needs to be
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:29.120]   impacted and then a class cast exception error which we'll talk about next we provide a change list this
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.400]   change list gives you it's kind of a double click on the summary summarizes the key changes in your pr and
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.120]   then looks at what are the diffs that comprise that so you as a reviewer you get a quick
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.520]   double click on what actually matters in this pr now let's go through a couple of these suggestions
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.080]   so this first one is really about this resource management resource manager class is talking about a
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.400]   permanent resource leak if you don't fix this so we give you a detailed code suggestion
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.120]   which you can then one click apply as a commit or you can batch those commits
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:07.920]   the next suggestion that we'll look at really briefly is this non-thread safe static cache implementation
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.320]   and so we again we've given you a code suggestion we're suggesting a concurrent hash map instead of a
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.760]   hash map to avoid race conditions now let's talk a little bit about this third suggestion which i think
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:26.080]   is really important and highlights how we use sonnet so we really use sonnet to provide that human-like
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.120]   code review and those reasoning capabilities we've done a lot of work to really understand your code base
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.480]   and that's where sonnet kind of comes in so if you look here what we've got is this network data fetcher
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   class it has been cast to a link list this is java if you're not familiar with java i'll just kind of
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.280]   walk you through it but really what's happening here is that this data uh you can see there's a data
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.120]   processor constructor that then cast something to an array list which is going to cause a class cast
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:01.520]   exception in production now how did the how did we find this well what bido has done is that it looked
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   through the code and said hey for this network data fetcher you were trying to instantiate this data
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.200]   processor object this data processor object then well what is that we went and looked crawled your code
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   understood it through abstract syntax trees a symbol index and sonnets reasoning and said hey this is cast
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.120]   as an array list and so now this array list you know is going to collide with this link list and going
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.160]   to create an exception in production this is probably an error that most humans wouldn't even find let
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.120]   alone you know most systems now if we want to shift this left we can even bring this to your ide so here's
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.800]   the same changes in your ide you can easily kind of right click and say hey i want to review my local
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.960]   changes stage commits etc run review those local changes the same agent runs in your ide again being driven by sonnet
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.800]   um and we provide the the output and then you can one click apply those suggestions
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:01.040]   uh so that's uh that's a little bit about how it how it works uh maybe i'll just mention one last thing
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:09.680]   so we have hundreds of customers and you know the question is well what impact is this really having
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.880]   so prs are closing in one-tenth a time so that pr that used to close take 50 hours to go from open
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:22.640]   to merge now goes open to merge in five hours these are three companies hundreds of engineers and bito's
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.720]   providing 80-ish percent of the feedback that a pr receives so we're taking care of the vast majority of
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.520]   the work and it's really being driven by the fact that ai provides that feedback in three minutes or four
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.560]   four minutes instead of one or two days thank you
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:47.680]   let's talk about something different so my name is hike and i want to talk about refusion so refusion
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:54.480]   is a generative music startup here in san francisco and we work on training frontier music models
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.480]   and then create an incredible product experience for crafting and exploring the art of music and our
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.960]   song lyrics writing pipeline is powered by claude so our core thing that we train is a
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.040]   diffusion transformer we train this from scratch and we think it's the most creative music model
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.080]   in the world we train it for quality for diversity for speed for controllability
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.560]   and as a fun anecdote this square of pixels here represents 30 seconds of music in our latent space
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:33.120]   um it's kind of crazy to think about how compressed that is but uh writing fantastic song lyrics is a
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   crucial part of great songs um and current llms are um good at a very many things but writing good
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:46.640]   song lyrics they're they're still pretty cringy um but claude is the best for sure and we built an agent
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:52.000]   called ghostwriter that's essentially meant to help you write and refine song lyrics as an artist
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.280]   and basically focusing on you know diversity humor taste what flowing with the music itself and this
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.680]   is a crucial tool um in our product uh it's been used tens of millions of times now to to write song
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:13.600]   lyrics so let's go demo some stuff if we pop over to my computer so this is our home page refusion.com
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.960]   check it out it's really fun there's a lot of amazing music to explore on here um i will
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:32.640]   just punch in something here uh let's say experimental indie trip hop about the feeling of getting better
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:41.520]   after being really sick there's a song concept pop in a couple of those um in the meantime let me just
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.040]   play a song and there's a there's a ton of really deep editing workflows here for getting in stuff but also
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.120]   just getting started you can just type something in and start listening to music and go from there
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.840]   so let me just play a song from the the home page and then we'll go back and listen to what we made
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.240]   don't downplay my brine i've been clocking kills since the ink dried on that line you ain't copping
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.760]   these souls now limited supply too many laws left cold in the breeze then they mama selling gumbo just
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.120]   to cover the fees please flip the corner cash the equity that's the creed but most is crashing out
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.280]   living life on the speed in the dry cool breeze thick hair like alicia keys told god your manifest me
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.160]   queen take it out fill the closet let us stun on the scene but i'm cut different ain't a rapper who
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.440]   i run my steez news all right so let's listen to some of the songs here we've got the reawakening
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.640]   let's see what the lyrics look like here written by a ghostwriter with claude
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:53.120]   my muscles forgot what they're meant to do
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:00.480]   the ceiling fan spins in slow motion while i gather strength to move
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:14.240]   fingertips press against the mattress testing if i can hold my way pretty good let's see dawn fade
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.240]   so whenever ghostwriter generates we have uh kind of an iterative process of thinking about the
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.280]   concept of a song ideating about actually the context of the genre you're writing for because
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.800]   say the lyrics of a drum and bass song are super different the lyrics of a you know a folk song
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:45.200]   that might be storytelling um and that process of just trying to get something that actually fits with
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:52.160]   the music is actually really hard and subtle and requires a lot of iteration and refinement so an example
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.040]   of some of the kind of deep editing stuff we can do here so we can do remixing to create variations to
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   extend from a certain section to replace a section actually to swap the stems like the vocals and the
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.760]   sound while keeping the other one the same and even capturing this idea of a vibe which is like a short
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.040]   audio snippet that you can then use the prompt instead of text so you can mix and match these things
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.480]   and just get really deep in your refinement and then with ghostwriter let's say if we were to use a
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:30.400]   prompt here um we were to use the lyrics here actually throw them up then we could type in here like
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:43.680]   add a spoken word intro in french and just pop that in and start start iterating so yeah that's the that's the
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.960]   app and the product and it's it's a really fun experience and um claude's claude's definitely the
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.920]   best for this kind of stuff so yeah come talk to me come talk to henry if you're interested in music and uh
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:04.960]   thanks um hey everyone i'm drew from the co-founder and ceo of create uh we're an ai text to app builder
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.160]   that lets anybody build working software products um on the internet and uh the exciting thing about
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.560]   create is it's an ai agent that can take in just natural language prompts and go end to end uh on
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.520]   building things so we got our start in web apps and claude is one of the base models that powers a lot
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:30.320]   of our code writing for the agent um but we're really excited about um our new mobile app builder
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.240]   that is for the first time letting people actually build mobile apps and so today i thought i'd just
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.640]   go ahead and show it off so i'll switch over to the live demo um and we're in beta but uh somebody just
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:50.240]   actually emailed me an idea a few weeks ago for a family memory app that lets people uh basically
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:59.920]   store their memories on their phones uh upload their uh different images and oops live demos
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.080]   uh store their different images and uh get going on building their family memory app so let me actually
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:22.800]   go create a new project and type this in and say make an ios app for this
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   and as you type creates agent starts getting to work um it's going to start building out all the core
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:38.000]   pages um as well as the back-end functionality for what you need um and so it will also pull in other
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:45.440]   integrations you can you might need to use um and go ahead and get set up i uh i am actually going
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:51.040]   to go ahead and switch to some pre-loaded things so the basic idea is you prompt uh and you're able
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.880]   to actually generate full applications um the cool thing about create oh there we go starting to build a
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:03.920]   little bit um is that um it also comes built in with back-ends and front-ends and everything you kind of need
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:10.160]   from the uh from the database to the actual core off um and so here it's actually building out my family
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.960]   memory's front-end but then in a second you'll see that also issues the like schemas uh for the database
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.760]   and goes ahead and deploys a full database and hooks up all the functions needed to talk to this front-end
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.840]   we are really excited about the fact that non-technical users in the hundreds of thousands are starting to
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.520]   pour into create to actually fully build apps um without needing to go to the id and truly just
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.720]   work from prompt land um and so one of the biggest things that we've been working on is actually the
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.520]   ability to also fully submit from create as well um create after your app is done then goes ahead and
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.560]   submits your app straight to the app store and builds a build for you um there's actually an app we
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   built uh in a day um you can just in one click publish it and submit to the app store and this
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:02.160]   will go ahead and kick off a build um we actually already started uh got this app in the app store
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.480]   so if anyone here wants to download it and play with it it's an ai app that lets you very quickly take
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.720]   drawings and turn it into uh ai images called draw daily um and then in the beta the thing that's been the
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:18.560]   most exciting uh for us is just seeing all the cool apps that are being created so we just hosted a demo day
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:24.320]   and this is william and he is making an app to help you memorize meaningful connections
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.840]   and details of people's lives and pull it up and so you just talk to the app and it pulls up
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:39.520]   special information about your contact info and and helps you remember anything for sales calls or
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:47.280]   anything else you want or we also had a student at berkeley who's building the scholarship app that he's
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.440]   always wanted um where he's constantly filling out grants um and unable to kind of do it automatically
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.520]   and so he's building scholar gpt and a lot of these like the core agent of how they built we're using
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.840]   you know prompt caching tool calling a lot of the core primitives that anthropic makes available to
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.000]   actually get them to success and just to show a few more um blaze is actually a basketball coach
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.840]   and for the first time ever he's using create to get rid of all of these spreadsheets and drills he does for
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   his uh coaches and instead uh you build a full player coach app that lets them uh download uh drills uh put
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:33.600]   their lesson plan out and then uh see animations on in the app of how they uh should be uh getting used
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   and then finally uh we've also had personal finance apps being created um so like a personal ai money
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:47.600]   coach for gen z with full rag um that also has a claude powered uh assistant that can figure out your
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.560]   monthly income and give you personalized financial recommendations and so part of what we were like
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.480]   most excited about is just the explosion of who and how uh software will be made um when you give people
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:07.120]   of these tools and very excited to partner with uh claude to power all of this thank you
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   Thank you.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:38.100]   Thank you.
