[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm going to share with you that what I'm going to share with you today is something that I feel very strongly with,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   but I haven't always felt strongly about.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   This is actually something that I kind of just bumbled into when I was working as a financial planner.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is something that I didn't really get, and it was pure happenstance that my financial planning software
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   would run a sales illustration page for me in the plans.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I started looking at it, and then I looked at it, and then I looked at it every time,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and I realized it was probably one of the most valuable tools that I could use with financial planning.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That page was actually the lifetime value of income.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Now, this page did a couple of things.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Often what it was used for, actually, in the software that I used,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   is it was used as a page for establishing the sale of insurance products that would cover the value of your income.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   For example, it would take what you're making today, and it would project it forward until the date of retirement,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   which I had run in the plan, and then it would usually grow it at whatever rate of inflation that I had set.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Let's assume I'd set a 3% rate of inflation.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It would take that number of your income currently, and it would grow it at 3%,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and it would say what the total value is of that income.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That was great, and then it would follow it with a discounted value.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It would say if the total value of your lifetime income is $2 million,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and we're coming back a certain number of years,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   it would discount it and take a present value calculation and say,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   "If we had, say, $1.2 million and we could invest it at 6% for income,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   we could replace the value of your income."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Now, this was actually for a very long time how life insurance and life insurance agents
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   calculated the amount of life insurance that was appropriate for you.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   The idea would be in the past.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   We do it a little bit differently now, but the idea would be,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "Well, if you're going to earn, say, $3 million,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and if I can replace that with $1.5 million of life insurance today,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and if I can invest that and replace your income,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   then I've replaced your financial value for your family."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   That used to be how planning was done for life insurance.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Today we use a needs analysis approach, which I like a little bit better.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I think it's a little bit more specific, but it's certainly a--
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   the lifetime value of income approach is certainly a valid way to do it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I don't have any problems with that.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I prefer it over the multiple of income approach,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   which is the way that you hear much bandied about,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   which is buy 10 times your income or 15 times your income
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   or 8 times your income of life insurance.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That is, in my opinion, the worst way to do it, but it's better than nothing.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Better to have some life insurance than nothing.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So, hey, if it gets people to buy life insurance, I'm okay with it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But what I started to look at it and see the value of that page
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   is it would actually allow me to understand what somebody's income was.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now, purely by happenstance, the financial planning software that I would use
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   would insert this page immediately following somebody's balance sheet,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   their income--excuse me, their assets and their liabilities and their net worth.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And when I started going through it, what would happen is oftentimes,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   especially with the demographic that I started working with
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   when I was a young planner, I didn't know a lot of rich people
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and I wasn't probably qualified to do planning for them very well
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   until I learned a little bit more.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And so I was working with a lot of people who were broke.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And their balance sheet would show that they were broke.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And oftentimes, if the number at the bottom of the page, the net worth number,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   would either be very low or it would be negative.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And what I learned is I was always a little bit depressed
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   presenting a number that was negative, and it was usually due to student loans.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Because when I started, I was 23 years old.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I had a lot of young clients who were in their mid to late 20s.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And it's not hard for a mid to late 20 person,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   especially if they've gone to college and taken out student loans,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   to have a low income number--excuse me, a low net worth number,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   a negative number because of the student loans.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   There's not a corresponding asset that shows up on the balance sheet
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   that offsets that number.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   So I would lead with the balance sheet, and then I would present next--
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   on the next page, the lifetime value of their income.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And I would always try to encourage them and say,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   "Look, look, look how much your income is worth."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And then finally what I realized is that that was the key number
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   that was missing on the balance sheet.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   After all, the reason somebody's net worth was negative
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   was because they'd gone to college usually,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and they had $50,000 of student loans.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Well, the hope and the idea and the ideal for most of those people
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   was that by investing, quote-unquote, into a college degree,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   they were going to be able to earn a higher wage.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And so it was actually that next page, the lifetime value of income,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   that would demonstrate that they had gotten a good investment.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   They'd gotten a good--getting a good return on their money.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So then I learned to change my language a little bit,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and I learned to demonstrate that to my clients and say,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   "Look at the value of your income.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   If we just do a few things correct, you can build wealth."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And once I cracked that code, I did that with every client,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and what I learned was I loved to do it, and the clients understood it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Because what it focused on was not where they were today,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   but rather it focused on the few simple steps that they needed to do
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   to make good progress toward their goals.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Let me give you an example here so that you understand more clearly.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Assume that I'm doing planning for a young couple,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   a man and a woman are both age 30,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and assume that this couple, each person has $50,000 of income.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So it's about the median income in the United States of America.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I think it's about $52,000 currently. I like $50,000.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So you've got $50,000 of income for each,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   so multiply that times two, that's $100,000 of household income.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Now assume that the balance sheet looks like this.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   This would be a fairly average middle class, probably a median balance sheet.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Assume that they own a $180,000 house.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   They own $30,000 worth of cars.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   They have $5,000 in a savings account,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and let's just say they have about $5,000 in a 401(k).
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now that's the value of their assets, about $220,000 total,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   primarily in house and cars.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Also assume that there's a $150,000 mortgage,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   $20,000 worth of car loans, and $15,000 worth of student loan debt.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So that would put liabilities of $185,000.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Now on paper, this couple has a $35,000 net worth,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   but the problem is that that is primarily found in their home, their home equity.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   $30,000 of the $35,000 is actually house equity,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and the challenge with having house equity is that most people who have house equity feel poor
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   because you can't access it, myself included.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Too much money in house equity and not enough money in cash.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So you can't access it, so it doesn't really make you feel that great.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So even though this couple that I've described is probably doing pretty well
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and they're doing better than many people in society,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   they certainly don't feel rich by any means.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And to have a net worth of $35,000 does very little to make them feel rich.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Now what if I talk about their income, however?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And let's figure out how much their income is worth.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   In this scenario, assume that this 30-year-old person has a $50,000 income
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and assume that they are going to increase their income by 3% each year.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   This is just going to be simple cost-of-living adjustments that are keeping pace with the rate of inflation.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But look at the difference in the numbers.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   They start with $50,000 and then a year later they receive a 3% increase,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and so they're earning $51,500.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   A year later, another 3% increase, compounding, they're earning $53,045.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And this happens each year.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And fast forward and let's just say it's over a 40-year career from age 30 to age 70.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Do you know what the total value of that income is?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   $50,000 income compounding at 3% annually from age 30 to age 70 would be $3,933,164.88.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Let's call it $4 million among friends.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And that's for one spouse.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What about the other? What if they both work?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well, it's about $8 million, $7,866,000 times two, and that's at a 3% growth rate.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Now, compare how you would feel in that situation as a member of that 30-year-old couple
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   when I'm sitting there and demonstrating to you that you have a net worth of $35,000,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   of which $30,000 is locked up in home equity, so you really feel broke.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And I'm pointing out to you, however, that you can enjoy a household income of probably about $8 million
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   between now and the age of 70.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Pretty amazing, right?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Super depressing if you--well, not super depressing.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Moderately depressing if you focus only on net worth.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   But if you look at the value of that income, it should do a couple of things.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Number one, it should be encouraging to you.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And that's key.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   When you're young, you should be looking forward--well, any time, you should be looking forward
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and looking at your income and be encouraged by that.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And two, it should cause you to ask the question of saying, "What do I need to do with that income
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   to make sure that I have some of it in my pocket in the fullness of time?"
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And that's key.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Because when I'm doing planning for a 55-year-old couple or for a 45-year-old couple,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   oftentimes that 45- or 55-year-old couple might be in exactly the same net worth statement as that 30-year-old.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That's what statistics show.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   When you start looking at what the average person has saved for retirement,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   it's not that far off from that age 30 that I explained.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But the problem is they don't have 40 years of income in front of them.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   They only have 20 years of income in front of them.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   So however many years of income you have in front of you, I want you to focus on that number
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and ask yourself, "What do I need to do with that number to make sure that some of it stays in my pocket?"
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now, remember that this client here has $220,000 of assets and $185,000 of liabilities.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Now, how easy would it be for this person to become really, really rich
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and acknowledge the fact that they have got $8 million of expected income over their lifetime?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   $8 million of expected income over their lifetime.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And all they got to do is pay off $185,000 of debt and pile up a few million bucks for themselves.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It should be pretty doable, right?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's very doable.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   $8 million of income, $185,000 of debt.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   We got to pay off the debt and we got to set aside a couple or three or $4 million for ourselves.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That is really doable.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But it's only doable if you don't spend all that money.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   It's only doable if you actually set aside some of that income and actually invest it wisely.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But it should be a bit haunting to look at that number and recognize that I'm going to earn $8 million.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It's disgraceful in that scenario, barring catastrophic events,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   it's disgraceful to not wind up with at least a million or two tucked away.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   In the land of abundance that most of us live in,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   we should be ashamed of ourselves if we don't at least tuck some of that money aside.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   It's too easy in the land of abundance that we live in to not do that.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Now, I'm not saying that you're going to feel it all up front.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The problem is we don't feel these numbers all up front.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Rather, we see the income numbers.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   We don't see the $4 million total income number.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   We only see the $2,900 net income number that flows into our bank account each month
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   from one of those $50,000 jobs.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   What I'm doing here, I'm just taking $50,000 divided by 12.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   That comes out to be $4,166.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Let's just plug in, say, 70% to account for employment taxes at 7.65%
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and account for a net effective tax rate of 7.65% to be--excuse me--of--I can't do podcast math--22.35%.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   22.35% effective income tax rate, state, local, and federal.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   I'm just using a 30% total tax rate.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Again, $50,000 divided by 12 is $4,166 times 70%.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Then what's worse is if you divide that by 2, let's say you're paid bimonthly,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   you wind up with a $1,500 paycheck.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   It's $1,458 paycheck.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   That doesn't feel like all that much money.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   But if you don't effectively manage the $1,458 net paycheck,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   you don't ever get to pile up the money.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   So what I'd encourage you to do is to start thinking in terms of the lifetime value of your income
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   in the context of your financial plan.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   First, calculate it.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So sit down and make a spreadsheet for yourself
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and calculate how much is your lifetime value of your income.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   If you're good with math, you can do this on a calculator.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   All you need to do is you need to take the number, inflate it,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and then take the total value of those payments and calculate that.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   If you want to do it in Excel spreadsheet, it will be easier for you
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   because you can just change it and you can clearly see it.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   If you don't know how to make an Excel spreadsheet,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I've prepared a very simple short video presentation of me doing that in preparation for this show.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   That spreadsheet is free. It's online.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's available for the patrons of the show.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   So if you'd like access to that, just make sure you become a patron of the show,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   You can do that for as little as a buck a month,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and you'll have access to that spreadsheet.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I've done it with Google Spreadsheets, which is a free online spreadsheet program that you can use,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and I'll just show you how to set that up.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Very simple. Most of you could be able to do it for yourself,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   but if you need to know how to do that, just find that on the Patreon feed for that,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/patrons, and then click on "Patron" and then click on "Activity."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So calculate for yourself what is the lifetime value of your income,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   and then start thinking in terms of that number,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   thinking in terms of what you can do with that number.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Now, there are some bonus things that you can do,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and these are natural corollaries of that lifetime value of number.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Let's figure out how do we get this higher.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Well, I can think of three ways that you can increase your income.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Number one, the higher the starting value of income, the better.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So the higher the first wages that you start with, the better,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   because over time that will compound over a lifetime.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Number two, the higher the annual increase on your wages, the better,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   because then your compounding will grow more over time.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And number three, the more years of income, the better.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And all of these things are extremely valuable to recognize
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   because these are the things that are under your control.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Let me give you a couple of examples.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Let's keep my scenario constant,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and let's say we're starting with $50,000 of starting wages
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and 1.03%--excuse me, 3% of annual increases.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And let's calculate what the total value of a lifetime wages would be
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   if we could start at a higher number.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   $50,000, our total earning power for a 40-year career from age 30 to age 70,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   is $3.9 million.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   What if we start at $55,000?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Well, now at $55,000, we're at $4.3 million.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   So that's a difference of $400,000 of total lifetime income
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   for just a measly difference of $5,000 of a starting point.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   $400,000.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So if all you did was start at a slightly higher rate
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and simply save that extra $5,000 per year,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   that will make a dramatic difference in your long-term financial security.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   What if you increase the annual growth rate?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Well, I'm going to drop it back to $50,000,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but now instead of increasing wages at 3% per year,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   let's increase wages at 5% per year.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Remember, wages at 3% is basically $3.9 million.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   What would it be at 5%?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   $6.4 million.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So just simply increasing the rate of annual increase from 3% to 5%,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   which 5% is extremely doable,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   you raise your lifetime earnings from 30 to 70 from $3.9 million to $6.4 million.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   That's an extra $2.5 million of earned income.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That's dramatic, isn't it?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   What if you extend the amount of years?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Let's drop this back to 3%.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And let's just say you're starting at $50,000,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   3% annual increases,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and now instead of working over a 40-year career,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   you work over a 50-year career.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So whether this is from 30 to 80 or from 20 to 70 or something like that,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   you're starting at $50,000.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   The difference between age 70 at $3.9 million to age 80 is $5.8 million of earnings.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Working an extra 10 years, you earn an extra $1.9 million by working an extra 10 years.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   It's amazing, huh?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Now the key--and I'm going to talk about how to do each of these things--
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   but the key to wealth is by focusing on your income
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   and then doing intelligent things with it.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But all three of those things are adjustable, and you can impact them.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So as an example here, let's assume--
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   so let's start with starting with an income.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   We all know about, "Well, hey, if you can earn more money, then that's even better."
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   So that's initially why college degrees have become so important in our culture
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   is because the idea is if I go to college,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   yes, I'm deferring my income for a number of years,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   but now when I get out, I'm going to start at a higher wage.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Let's say you start at the age of 30, and you earn $60,000 instead of $50,000.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And let's say that instead of earning a 3% annual increase, you earn a 6% annual increase.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And do you know how much that is at age 70?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It's $9.9 million.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So just changing that, starting at $60,000 instead of $50,000,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   increasing wages at 6% annually instead of 3% annually, that's $9.9 million.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Now here's what's intriguing about this.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   A, multiply that times 2, that's $20 million of earned income.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   For an average median earning--that's slightly more than median income.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   For a mostly average, almost median earning household
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   that's just simply working over a 40-year career,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   starting at a slightly higher wage,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   and increasing annual income at double the rate of inflation
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   through the application of skill and intelligent career advancement.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's $10 million for an individual and $20 million for a couple.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   What if you did it over a 50-year career instead of a 40-year career,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and you worked from 30 to 80?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Well, now for an individual starting at $60,000 per year,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   increasing income at 6% per year over a 50-year career,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   that's $18.5 million of earnings.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Couple, $37 million of earnings.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Massive numbers. Massive numbers.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Now, I recognize that many of you don't necessarily have a desire
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   to work for a 50-year career, and that's fine.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I recognize that many of you aren't earning $60,000 per year
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   or aren't compounding your income at 6% per year,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   but all of these things are doable,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and I'm going to cover some reasons why you might choose to do it
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   or not choose to do it as I go through them.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But my point is these numbers get massive,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and the starting point of any wealth plan is commanding a high income,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   increasing that income steadily and substantially,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and earning that income for as long a period as possible.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   That's it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So how can you do this?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Because I want to give you some tools.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   So these three things, number one, the higher the income, the better.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Focus on starting from a position of strength
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   and focus on earning higher wages from as early a point in time as possible.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So again, college degrees is the most common way,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   but that is not the only way,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and that's becoming an increasingly less effective way.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   But as a simple example,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   consider the starting income of a neurosurgeon versus a general medical doctor
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   versus a frontline fast food worker.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Their starting incomes are substantially different.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Why?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Because they have to invest more up front,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and their income is higher because of that earlier investment
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   because if they weren't able to get the higher wages,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   it would be foolish for them to make the longer investment of time,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   so they have to earn it out over a lifetime period.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So anytime you can start at a higher rate through education,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   that can be valuable,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   and a college degree might be the ticket.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Advanced college degrees might be the ticket.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Also, I say look for a high skill or high education industry.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Skill matters.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Skills matter.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   We're paid for skill and skills.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   We're also paid for knowledge.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   The work that I do in creating this show is a combination of knowledge,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   where I need to demonstrate and apply specific financial planning knowledge.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's also a combination of applied skills,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   where I need to learn and apply interesting skills
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   to create interesting and entertaining content that the audience will respond by listening.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It's the same in your business.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   You need to apply skill and knowledge,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   and natural ability is important.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Knowledge, skills, and ability is what we get paid for.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Another way to earn a higher income is, I would say,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   focus on a difficult industry.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Hard work pays.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I learned this, thankfully, when I was a kid,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and my dad said, "If you do hard jobs, you get more money."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The older I've gotten, the more I look around and realize
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   that by doing hard jobs, I get more money.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Now, when I was young, I learned this doing construction,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and I realized at a time when I was doing construction work
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and I had friends that were doing retail work,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   they were earning minimum wage,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and I was earning far more than minimum wage.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   But when I looked at the difficulty, and not even necessarily a skill level,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   because I didn't have any major skills,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I just looked at the difficulty of their job versus mine.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   They were working in an air-conditioned store,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   hanging out, folding clothes at a clothing store,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and I was sweating and carrying boxes of tile to a tile job
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   and mixing up buckets of mud,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   and I realized hard work pays.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So Joshua's tip, if you want to make more money,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   look for the hardest job you can find and learn how to do it.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You'll make more money.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Always look to start with a higher income amount,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and that will result in a much higher total lifetime earnings.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   That's step one. Start at higher wages.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Number two, the more you can increase your income each year, the better.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   There are a couple ways to do this.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Number one, you could start with steady increases.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So going from 3% to 6%, if you do that every year,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   that can be fantastic over a lifetime.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Assume that you're just going to get 3% increasing,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   because in order to keep all things being equal from a technology perspective,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   in order to keep employees,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   an employer is going to have to maintain their wages with inflation.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Now, generally, this is why human costs are the biggest expense line item
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   in most companies' budgets.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   So anytime an employer can automate you and outsource you,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   that's going to be very much in their interest for their own profit.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   So we can't necessarily control for that.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   But assuming that is controlled for,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   in order to retain employees over time, not every year,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   they're going to have to maintain wages with at least inflation.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So there's probably going to be a pretty good, consistent way
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   for you to maintain your wages just with inflation.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   But you can get over inflation by building knowledge and applying it,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and by gaining and applying skill, and by enhancing your abilities.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And that is very doable and very controllable.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Just look for saying, "What is the knowledge that I need?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   What are the skills that I need?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   What are the abilities I need to develop?"
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And stay current with those things and improve them.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Work hard, do a great job, be productive.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Look all the time you're at work.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   There are studies that show that the average worker,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   when they're at work, works drastically less than the amount of time
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   that they're actually being paid for.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I'm hedging just a little bit because I don't remember the average numbers,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   but my guess is that it's probably less than 50%.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   That the average person at work spends less than 50% of their actual time
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   on the job actually working.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   I don't know that number.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I didn't look it up in preparation for this show, so I could be wrong.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But my guess is probably around that number.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   If any of you can show data one way or the other,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   prove me wrong or prove me right, put that in the show notes for today's notes.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   But if you only did one thing, I'm convinced if you only did one thing,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   the entire time that you're at work, you work hard,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   you're probably going to command double the rate of inflation of annual increases.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Because the average worker simply does not work while they're at work,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   if you just work, that sets you apart.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So if you start at 8, get there at 7.50 so you can be prepared to start work at 8.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And if you finish at 5, finish at 5 and leave at 5.15 so you can work till 5.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Instead of spending time talking, browsing ESPN.com or whatever your version of your--
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   whatever distracts you, work.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Focus on actually working.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Easier in some jobs than others.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   If you have a job where you're paid on a piece rate,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   whether you're a driver and you're driving per mile
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   or whether you're producing something, then it's easier there to measure your work.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   I just think of many offices that I've worked in,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I just noticed that it seems like the average person doesn't spend that much time working.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Even if you do spend time working, work on the things that are most important.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   So congratulations by working when you're at work.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Number two, work on the things that are most important.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Focus on the highest value-added activities first, not on the lowest.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And that could do a whole show on that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   I won't do it, but I just say that.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Focus on building steady increases.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Then you've got to make sure that you're in an industry or a position
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   where you will be rewarded for those increases in output or increases in production.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Joshua's pro tip, avoid working in a government bureaucracy.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I've-- all of the friends of mine who are government workers,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   there's not really much point in working in a government bureaucracy,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   at least if you expect your income to be affected by your work.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   The income is legislated, and because it can't be unfair,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   it has to be within a certain range.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And so there's very little incentive for you to increase your output.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So if you-- that can be a great move from a lifestyle perspective.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   If you want to have a lifestyle where you don't do much work for more money,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   then look for a government or a bureaucratic position.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   But if you want to be paid for your output, look for a position where that's rewarded.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   That's why I loved sales.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   That's why I love sales still, is I want to be paid not for--
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I want to be paid for results, not for time.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I want to be paid for making things happen.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I want to be paid the true value of my work.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   So I'd like that work to be measured in a way where I can know that.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   So 2A, 2 is higher the annual increase the better.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   A is make steady increases and increase those over time.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   2B is big jump increases.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And this is one of the biggest un-pursued forms of action
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   that people don't really think about.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Constantly be job hunting.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Constantly be job hunting.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   One of the useful little metaphors that I think of is I'm self-employed.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   All of us-- I run my own business.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   All of us run our own businesses.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It just happens to be that the current high bidder,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   your one and only contract is the company that you're working for
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   if you're working in a salaried position.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   That came out clumsily, but hopefully you get my point.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Don't see your employer as XYZ corporation.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   See yourself as your employer.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   You're running your own business,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   and you're just hiring out your services to whoever the highest bidder is.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Employers are constantly bidding against each other for employees.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   The most difficult thing that employers have to do is find and attract
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and develop quality human talent.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   That is tough.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   So you need to be constantly looking and marketing yourself
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   to different employers and figuring out
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   are there some opportunities to change.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   If you've been stagnant and your income has just been increasing
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   by small percentage points for a few years,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   be hunting and be looking for saying,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   "How can I make a 20% increase?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   How can I make a 50% increase?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   How can I double my pay?"
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   If you are effective at your job,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   it might be possible for you to go in and tell your employer
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   while negotiating salary that you would like a 50% increase,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and you might be able to justify it such that your employer
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   will pay you that money.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   But it will be far easier if you can go to another job
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   or another position at another company
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and speak to a different employer
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   and negotiate for a salary or a pay structure
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that is 50% higher than what you're currently doing.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So constantly be hunting for a better opportunity
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and look for those big jump increases.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I think it would be silly to transition from one job
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   where you're earning X amount to another job
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   where you're earning X amount plus 5%.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And the reason would be because now you have to go
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and you have to build out your reputation,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   you have to build out your history,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   you don't have any seniority,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   you don't know who the people are that you're working with,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   you don't know those things.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   So you have to start that process all over again.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   But if you can go from X to X plus 50% at another opportunity,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   that would be tremendous.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   So be constantly on the job hunt.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Be constantly building and developing a network of people
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   that you can work with, that you can be connected with
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   so that you find out about the jobs
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   long before they're ever posted.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   I'm convinced at this point in 2015
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   that companies only ever post jobs
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   to cover their butt legally speaking.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Or if they do post a job, it's probably the last of the last.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's the last--like they're desperate for somebody
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   so they've got to post a job.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Because the challenge of figuring out how to wade through--
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   how on earth do you--
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   put yourself in the position of a hiring manager.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Let's say you post a job
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and you get 300 applications and resumes.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   How on earth do you have any chance
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   of wading through those 300 applications
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   and feeling confident with your decision?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Wouldn't it be better to be able to fill the position
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   before you need to advertise for it?
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I can't prove that data.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   If any of you know of data that would demonstrate it,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   but from my knowledge and understanding of
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   even the job hunt world,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   that's probably a pretty accurate guess.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   So the best jobs are never going to be advertised.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   You need to build a network.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Let me give an example for myself.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   There are a number of jobs that I could probably
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   advertise for right now for my show,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   things I need help with.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I need a podcast producer.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   I need somebody who can help me
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   by actually listening to the show,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   editing my audio,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   helping to edit some of the content
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   which gets too long-winded,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   where maybe I ramble or a guest rambles.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I need somebody who can splice things together,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   who can handle the technical aspects of
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   actually going out and putting the audio files together,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   who can upload stuff.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   I need a writer who can write my show notes for me
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   because that gets in my way.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I need somebody who can help me with my website,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   with my marketing development,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   with the technical side of some of the businesses
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   that I'm working on.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I can provide the content,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   but I need someone who can help with that.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I need somebody who can help me
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   just with my daily schedule,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   who can help me connect with guests,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   who can help me handle my email.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   I need somebody who can help me with my bookkeeping
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and my accounting.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I need some--
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I probably need more than that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I need somebody who can help me with all of these things
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   because, frankly, for me,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   the only things I should be doing
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   is reading, writing, recording, and speaking
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   because that's what I do better
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   than anyone else in the world does,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   and I should be able to hire those other things done.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   The problem is that it is so incredibly difficult
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   to have any idea of how on earth
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I could find and vet the right people
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   that I make the classic mistake
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   that most entrepreneurs make,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   which is just bumbling along doing it all myself
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   because I don't--
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   it's having done it before
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and having been forced to do it again.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I have to go and, you know,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I have to advertise for a job.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I've got to put a listing out there.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I've got to make it public in some way,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   and then I've got to collect enough applicants,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and it's very tough to feel confident
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   when you're just going to, you know,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   pick the first one,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   so that means I've got to interview
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   a certain number of people,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   and there's no way to gather from somebody's interview
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and just from a thing on paper
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   if they're actually going to work with it,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   work with you.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Then I've got to establish the paperwork,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and I've got to go through,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and I don't want to do that multiple times,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It is a major hassle,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and so in some ways it's easier,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   although it is short-sighted,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   it's easier to just keep bumbling along
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   doing it myself and doing it poorly.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   But if I came across the right person
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   or I were recommended the right person
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   who knew, even if that person knew nothing,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   but if that person were highly recommended
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   for the quality and the content of their character
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and for their skill base,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   hired immediately.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   That's what has been the most effective for me.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Now, I'm just one tiny entrepreneur
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   with a barely starting business,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   but I don't know any entrepreneur
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   who's any different.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I'll tell you, one of the best things
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   about being in sales,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   like I was in full-time professional sales,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I got offered more six-figure job opportunities
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   than I ever would have dreamed of
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   simply because the people that I was selling to
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   said, "Joshua, man, you're doing a great job.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Can I hire you?"
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And I've had a list of backups for a long time,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   backup plans.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   You know, if I ever get fired, call this person.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And that is so valuable,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   but that only happens through exposure,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   through building that network,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   through doing it proactively.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Harvey McKay wrote that book,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "Dig your well before you're thirsty."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   So if you want big jump increases,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   be out and available and be known.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Establish yourself as a leader
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   so that opportunities come to you.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Simple example I would say to you is be recruitable.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I always like to joke about this with financial advisors
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   because--and you talk to and ask a financial advisor
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and see if this isn't true.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I think the majority of us experience this.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   When we get into the industry,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   we have to go out and make phone calls
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and find out who we're going to work for.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   So we start interviewing all around,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and what you find is all of a sudden,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   you've got to get in here, you've got to get in there,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   you've got to test an interview here,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   you've got to see if this one works,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   if that one works.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And so you're just--it's a lot of work,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   and you're trying to figure out,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   "Where do I get established?"
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   And depending on your qualifications,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   sometimes you get offers and sometimes you don't.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   But if you're starting with no industry experience
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and no credentials,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   no--just qualifications other than I'm willing to work,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   it's tough to get started in a good position.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   It's really tough.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   But I'll tell you, as soon as you put the letters CFP
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   after your name on your LinkedIn profile,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   it's like your phone doesn't stop ringing,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and you'll start to get at least one call a month--
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   excuse me, one call a week from a recruiter.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Your email fills up with options,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   with your LinkedIn inbox.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I can hardly ever go in there anymore
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   because it's so scary,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   and I just kind of ignore the whole thing
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   and I pretend that the inbox doesn't exist.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   And everybody is out to get you.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Now, this is--it gets you in a good way.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   They want--you're about to be recruited,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   and it becomes exhausting to deal with the recruiting calls.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Now, I think they're valuable.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   I think they're incredibly valuable
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   as far as the potential of working with a recruiter.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   But a simple thing I would say is be recruitable.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Be the kind of person that the recruiters are looking for,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   and then when the timing is right
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and the opportunity is right,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   they'll help you out.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I had a rule.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I tried to take--I didn't--
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   I never take LinkedIn things
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   because that requires too much effort for me,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   but I took all the phone calls
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   because you never know.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   So get yourself into a position where you're recruitable,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   and then take the recruiting calls.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   You never know what kind of deal you might be offered.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Just tell the recruiter--
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I've had a couple of recruiters as clients.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's a tough business,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   but it's also a very rewarding business.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Just be straight with the recruiter.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Tell them what you want.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   A lot of times what you can do,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   if you have a recruiter
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   who doesn't have the right opportunity,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   just tell the recruiter,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "Here's what I'm interested in.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "Here are the parameters that I would be willing to accept."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And that recruiter,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   when they come up with another opportunity,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   will turn around and share that opportunity with you.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   It's tough to be a matchmaker in the recruiting business,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and so they want to have files of people that need workers,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and they want to have files of workers
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   depending on what they need,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   and that's where the best choices are.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So be recruitable.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Establish yourself as a leader in your industry
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   so the opportunities come to you.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Another example would be be an entrepreneur.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   An entrepreneur's skill sets
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   will often transfer from one business to another.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   So once you've established yourself in one business
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   and you know how to do that,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   then there can easily be a transition to another business.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Next, look for industries where competition is low.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   For the life of me,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I can hardly figure out
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   if anybody wants to be an attorney or a doctor.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And there's others too,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   but why does anyone want to be an attorney or a doctor?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Because the competition for those scenarios
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   is so incredibly high
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   that you have no chance of getting in
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   unless you are an extremely bright,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   dedicated, focused person.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And then as an extremely bright, focused, dedicated person,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   you're going to face a lifetime of competition
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   for extremely bright, motivated, focused people.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Why don't you just turn and go where competition is low?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   As an example, years ago I read about --
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I keep these lists of jobs,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and there are a couple of the ones that come to me.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Years ago when I read Tom Stanley's books on millionaires,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I read all his books.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   I read Millionaire Next Door,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and then I went and read his Marketing to Millionaires
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and things like that.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   One of the things that he pointed out to me in those books
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   -- the Millionaire Mind, I think, was another one --
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   is he talked about how many low-class, so-called low-class,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   industrial jobs have millionaires that are running them.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Take somebody who would be the average graduate
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   from a high-end medical school
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and put them into an industry
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   that is probably not known for very smart, focused, intense people.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Rather, it's more known for people
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   who are just simply doing the next thing
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   and working and looking to make another buck.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   And, man, the success potential is massive
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   compared to competing in this highly competitive field.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I read in his books years ago about junkyard owners,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   and I've proved it here in my town.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I started trying to figure out a way
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   to network in with junkyard owners.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   I started asking the incomes, "You know what?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   The average well-established scrap dealer
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   or junkyard owner in your town
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   makes over a million bucks a year,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and you'd never know it."
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Now, that might be an industry
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   that's saturated with competition,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   but what's another industry that you can look at
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   where your competitive environment
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   is not very professional,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   where your competitive environment is low?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Another one, an example, years ago,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   I called on an executive
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   in Wayne Huizenga's operation down in Fort Lauderdale,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and this person had been with Wayne Huizenga as the guy.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   He was most famous for, I think, waste management
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and Blockbuster, a billionaire down here in South Florida,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   well-known, owns the, what are they called now,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   the Miami Dolphins or Miami Marlins.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Anyway, big shot down here in South Florida,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and I was just interested that
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   one of the foundational companies
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   that he grew and built was waste management.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Blue-collar industry, grew this company,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   had a family background in it,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and built it and made a lot of money on it.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Another one that I've always had on my radar screen
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   was daycare centers.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Years ago, I read a manual for how to start
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   and build daycare centers,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and one of the major points of the manual was
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   that there's little need for,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   there's not a lot of competition in that field.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   A lot of the organizations were small, local,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   a lot of them were run by ladies
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   who weren't focused on it as a massive business,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   but were rather focused on it as a
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   sideline way to make some income.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   That's the type of scenario where you can bring
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   some hardcore entrepreneurial talent and focus
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   to that industry and have some massive growth.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I would always rather be a junkyard dealer
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   than an attorney myself,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   at least if that were my plan to get rich.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   If I'm doing it for other reasons, fine,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   but if it's my plan for getting rich,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   then look for a junkyard and run a junkyard business.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Don't go be an attorney.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Look finally on this section here of big jump increases,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   look for exponential growth and leverage opportunities.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Usually this is going to be found in
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   leveraging other people's work.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   If you are making widgets,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   you might be able to get better at your widget making over time,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   but it's probably going to be a linear growth,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   and if it is a geometric growth,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   over time it's going to slow because there's going to be
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   some limit somewhere on your ability to make widgets.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   But if you can build the widget making machine,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   and then you can make more machines
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   so that widgets are made all night while you sleep,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   or if you can build the organization
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   that hires people to make the widgets,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   now you have the exponential growth
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   and leverage opportunities.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   That's where the serious growth is.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Go back to my income.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Let's say that you were doing something like
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   following the 1,000% formula that I've talked about
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   in past shows, which is going to play a role
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   in actually tomorrow's interview.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Let's go back to my starting income,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   and let's just say this person is making $50,000 per year
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   over the course of a 40-year career,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   and they go from 3% annual increases,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and remember that's $3.9 million,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   to 20, let's go with 25% annual increases
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   because they can apply it to a business.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   You know what that number comes out to be
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   at a lifetime earnings of 70?
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It goes from $3.9 million to $1.8 billion,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   billion with a B, billion.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   You say, "That's impossible." Is it?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Aren't there people who have started
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   earning $50,000 a year at their first job
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   and who've earned over $2 billion
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   during the course of their working lifetime?
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   There's not many, but there are some.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   How did they do it?
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Leverage, business leverage.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   And that leverage can be found in,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   you know, the big, just can be found
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   in leveraging other people and building large businesses.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   It can be found in finding a unique market opportunity
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   and capitalizing on it.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   There's lots of ways to do it.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   So look for those not only big jump increases,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   but those shoot for the moon increases.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Look for the big ones with big leverage.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Look for the, even the risky long shot opportunities.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Some of those risky long shots pay off.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Some of them don't.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Be careful, but some of them do.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   And remember that 1,000% formula.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   If you're interested in that, you can find that.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It was one of the early episodes of the show, episode 10.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/10/10.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   You'll find that one where I go over
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Brian Tracy's 1,000% formula that just totally impacted me
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   when I first heard it when I was in high school or college.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   I can't remember.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   It made a massive difference in my life.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   The idea is that you can increase your income by 1,000%
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   over 10 years simply by increasing your effectiveness
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   and productivity by 1/10 of 1% every day.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   That's a formula that works.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I've actually got an interesting example coming on tomorrow's show.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   I'm going to share with you an interview with Michael Kitsis.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   He is a financial planner extraordinaire.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   One thing you'll hear in that interview, listen for it,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I actually trapped him into answering the 1,000% question.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   In that interview, I talked to him about his history with conferences,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and he kind of bumbled his way into it, as you'll hear in the interview.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Then I asked him how much he reads, how much he writes,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   how much time he spent doing these things.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Then I trapped him and I asked him about his 1,000% formula.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   I asked him if he was making 10 times more income
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   than he was making 10 years previously.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Tune in tomorrow to hear the answer.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   I think you'll find it interesting.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Look for ways to increase your annual income.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   That's step two.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Step three, finally here, the more years of income, the better.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Now, this might have impact on either end of your career
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   and probably on both.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   If you can start earlier, that's better.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   The question, can you start earlier?
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   If it's too late for you to start "earlier,"
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   can you help other people start earlier?
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   I have this dream, as you know from listening to the show,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   why on earth do people wait until the age of 30 to get their careers established?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Why don't young men and women have their careers established at 15?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Why are people only earning $100,000 through entrepreneurship at the age of 30?
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Why aren't they earning $100,000 through entrepreneurship at the age of 15?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   If it takes 10 years to learn a business and they start at 12 or 10,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   then why can't they be learned and be the leaders in their business by 20 or 22?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Why not?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Some businesses you can't, some businesses you can.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   But why not start earlier?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   So can you help your kids get started earning as quickly as possible?
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Why is 22 the magic age at which you graduate from college?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Or 23? Why not 18?
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Go back and look, I challenge you,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   go back and look at the academic achievements of past generations.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   If you heard that your great-great-grandmother graduated only from the sixth grade,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   go back and research what the sixth grade exam was that your great-great-grandmother graduated with,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   or the eighth grade exam that your great-great-whichever,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   however many greats your grandmother, your ancestors, graduated with in eighth grade.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   And I'll tell you, I'm not sure I could have actually passed that exam at the age of 18.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Go and look at what the age-banded and age-based achievements are today
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   and compare them to the past.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Now, certainly many students can succeed in today's environment.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Many students can start at 18 or start at 22 and do extremely well.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   But if you care about the ones that you're in contact with,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   that you're helping and that you're mentoring,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   do you think you might owe it to them to challenge them a little bit?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   I wish I'd been challenged a little bit more.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   I wish I'd been challenged to, by the time I was 18, to have my college degree done.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   And if nothing else, and I could start at 18 or 20, let's say I finish my college degree by 18,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   then I went on a walkabout around the world for two years,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   and then I came back and started at 20, even that would make a difference in my career.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   So can you get started now without waiting for formal credentials,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   and can you help your kids or other young men and women that you care about
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   get started with their earning and their learning as quickly as possible?
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   On the flip side, you can work longer.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   And this is a powerful thing that most people don't realize.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   And in fact, this is the number one way that most people will,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   depending on the United States of America and probably the world,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   to be able to sustain their lifestyles.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   They're simply going to have to work longer.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   It is not possible for the average person to retire in comfort at the age of 65.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   So what you see, working longer.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   The AARP in the United States has this whole program of redefining your life's goals
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   and redefining your life's vision at the age of 65.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   So I say if that's the case, then why don't we just plan for that?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Remember, back to my example here, let's assume that someone is just earning this $50,000
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and they're making 3% annual increases.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   The difference between working from 30 to 70, that's $3.9 million of income,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   and 30 to 80, that's $5.8 million of income.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   It's a big difference.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   That's an additional almost $2 million of income that you can earn from 70 to 80.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   And the reason for that is because those are the years at which you're at the highest paid, maybe,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   because there are some substantial problems with this model.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   And you need to be thinking about them in advance if this is what you're going to do.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Most people aren't at the highest years of their earnings from 70 to 80.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Sadly, many people are in very low earnings at that period.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   You've got to make sure that if you're going to plan on this or if you're going to consider this,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   you need to be looking for work that you'll be able to do for longer.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   This can be a real problem for people like laborers or any job where physical strength is a factor.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   I've worked in a fair number of construction environments,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   and you very rarely see an 80-year-old construction worker.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   There's a reason for that.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   If you're in the construction trade, you better be working.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   If you're going to plan to be working longer than, say, 50 to 60, you either better,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   A, be in incredible health, B, be running the company, or C, be focusing on finding a new opportunity.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   So make sure you're doing work that you can do for longer.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   This can also be a problem if your industry or your company has some kind of mandatory retirement program.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I've had a couple people close to me face this.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Their company has a mandatory retirement program at 65, and they're forced out, like it or not.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   It can be a major problem because at many times, men and women who are 65 years old are in the prime of their life.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   They've accumulated the knowledge, the wisdom, the experience, the education that they need to be extremely successful.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Physically, they're doing great. They've got a broad network.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   They're respected and admired as a leader in their industry.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   If at that point in time, you face mandatory retirement, that can be a real problem.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   So make sure that's not staring you down.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Look for work that you'll want to do for longer.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   If you hate your life and hate your job, you're not going to want to do it an instant longer than you have to.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   You're really not.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   So challenge.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Can you find work that integrates with your lifestyle, that doesn't compete with your lifestyle?
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Can you find work that gives you satisfaction and enjoyment for its own sake, a sense of purpose, a sense of mission,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   and still allows you to do well by doing good?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Make sure that you're thinking about that.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Because if you hate your job, hate your business, hate your life, you're not going to want to do it.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   You can't reap that extra $2 million of earnings.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   But if you love it, it can make a massive difference in your wealth.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   That can be set out much earlier than age of 70.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Look for work where your age and your wisdom will be an advantage to you rather than a disadvantage.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Ageism is a real thing.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   It's severe.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   I had the privilege of working with some clients in their mid-60s, and I've learned just how severe it can be.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   All the laws in the world don't do any good.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Maybe they do some good.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   All the laws in the world do little good.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   I'll hedge my statement a little bit.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   It doesn't matter if there's a law against ageism.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   If somebody doesn't want to hire you, there's always a way around the law.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Now the question is, can you find a scenario where your age is a real benefit for you?
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   This is one of the things that I loved about the field of financial advice.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   The older you get, as long as you can satisfy your retirement succession plan, where if you die,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   your clients have the confidence that there's a whole team of younger advisors that they know and they like,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   the older you get, the more benefit you have, that you have more white hairs and you can give more wise counsel.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Now that's probably not always true, but it certainly can be true.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   So think about that.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   If you face the potential for ageism in your industry, you need to be planning ahead to make sure that you overcome that.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Look for work where your lifetime knowledge and experience will accumulate and deliver great dividends of value in your older years.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Probably the most famous example of this in our society is Warren Buffett.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   It's his lifetime knowledge and investment experience give him a real edge over people.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   As long as he surrounds himself with a team of young, current people, he can bring that wisdom
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   and they can bring the perspective of a different generation and they can make a powerful team.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   And his grandfatherly image is a real benefit to him in his marketing efforts as compared to somebody who's just that young, brash, unproven person.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   When you get into the depths of the financial crisis and good old Grandfather Warren walks in with his checkbook out ready to write checks,
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   people are glad that he's there and they're glad that he's got some white hair.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   When good old Grandfather Warren writes something in his letter, everyone takes it as their gospel.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   That's different than when someone who's just equally smart, it doesn't have the experience and the platform that he's built.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Some 30-year-old hot shot investment person writes it, doesn't have nearly the same weight that it does for him.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   So plan ahead if you're going to work longer.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   Plan ahead because it can be a real benefit for you.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Those are the primary thoughts that I wanted to share with you.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   So your homework, here would be what I would say is your homework.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   A couple of things.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Number one, what is the expected value of your lifetime's worth of income?
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Simple to do this.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Look at how old you are, look at how long you expect to work, and then calculate in how much you expect your income to increase each year.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Again, you can use a financial calculator for this, you can calculate it by hand, you can use a spreadsheet.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   The spreadsheet is the simplest way.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   And then look at that number and say, "Is it enough?"
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Are you encouraged by that number?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Let's say that you're $200,000 upside down, you have a negative net worth, but you have millions of dollars of expected income.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Be encouraged by that and recognize that all I've got to do is throughout the course of my lifetime, make some simple steps and some simple changes,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   and I'll be able to apply this income to this scenario and it'll change over the coming decades.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Or if it's not encouraging, then figure out, "What do I need to change in this situation?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   What are the variables that are going to make the difference for me?
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   Maybe I'm making $30,000 a year."
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Well, guess what?
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   You can make more.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Might require some planning, might require some job hunting, might require some all kinds of things.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   You need to learn a whole new skill set, find a whole new industry, get established to move to another place.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   But you can go from $30,000 to $60,000 in reasonable time.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   Maybe your problem is you're just stuck in a place where there's not really much increase.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Speaking with somebody that's recently, loves teaching, is a teacher in a government school, loves teaching.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   There is zero chance whatsoever that he can make enough money to support his family going forward,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   simply because of the mess that it is, and he's riding on the wall.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   In that situation, he's got to get out of that profession.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   He's got to have the ability to keep current in a world where demand is going down and wages are stagnant.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   So what variables should you focus on?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   What's going to make the biggest difference for you?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Figure that out, write it down, and you'll be able to get started with your own unique plan.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   I hope this has been useful for you.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Did my best.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Income makes a big difference.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   Income is the biggest driver in your financial plan, and I hope these thoughts are helpful for you.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Check back tomorrow for the Michael Kitsis interview.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   I think you'll really enjoy that.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   And listen, now that I'm giving you a heads up, listen in advance for his journey to increasing his income,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   and listen for the application of that 1,000% formula.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   What you might want to do is go back and listen to episode 10 before actually listening to that interview tomorrow
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   so you're refreshed on the details of that 1,000% formula.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   You can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/10.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   If you need help actually sitting down and calculating the spreadsheet,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   remember that if you are a patron of the show, there's a simple video that I've set up for you,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   and you'll find it on the patron feed.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   You can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Just go right there and click on "Activity," and you'll see the video set up for you.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   That's a screen capture.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   It's me showing you how to actually set this up for yourself using a simple, free Google spreadsheet.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   You can do this in Excel.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   It's very simple and straightforward, but that should help you to actually be able to see the lifetime value of it.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   If you'd like to become a patron, follow that same link, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   and you'll find all the extra goodies that I've been setting up at different levels.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   For example, if you're in the $10 a month amount and up,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   I'll be scheduling our monthly Google Hangout before the end of the month.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Those of you who've gotten in now, you're getting an awesome deal
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   because you're getting a lot of access to me with small numbers of people.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Currently in the future, I expect those numbers to go up,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   but you're going to have tons of time to ask me anything you want,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   and I'll give you any answers that I can do.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   If you're an irregular, make sure you check the Facebook page for that bonus episode that I posted today
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   with the details of why I actually went to Dallas.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   And then for those of you, John, my single, at the moment, $200 and up supporter,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   I'll be getting you information on the details of our mastermind call this week,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   and John's got a great deal. It's just him and me, and he gets a ton of time.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   If you'd like to join him, I've got room for four total people at the $200 and up level,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   so I've room for three more people at this level, and you'll be able to have access to me.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I'll be catching up on all your private questions in the Facebook group today.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   That's it for today's show. Thank you so much for listening.

[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person, and I make mistakes.
