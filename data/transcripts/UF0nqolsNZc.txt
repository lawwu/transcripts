[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.260]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.160]   Today, we are going to discuss light
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880]   and the many powerful uses of light to optimize our health.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.680]   We're going to discuss the use of light
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.280]   for optimizing skin health, appearance, and longevity,
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.640]   for wound healing, for optimizing hormone balance,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.680]   and for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.000]   and even for offsetting dementia.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.540]   One of the reasons why light has such powerful effects
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.240]   on so many different aspects of our biology
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.800]   is that it can be translated into electrical signals
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.080]   in our brain and body,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.600]   into hormone signals in our brain and body,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   and indeed into what we call
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.560]   cascades of biological pathways,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.720]   meaning light can actually change the genes
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.680]   that the cells of your bodies express,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.120]   and that is true throughout the lifespan.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.760]   Today, I will discuss the mechanisms
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.640]   by which all of that occurs.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.480]   I promise to make it clear for those of you
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.360]   that don't have a biology background,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.320]   and if you do have a biology background,
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.080]   I'll try and provide sufficient depth
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.040]   so that it's still of interest to you,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.260]   and I promise to give you tools,
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.240]   very specific protocols that are extracted
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.640]   from the peer review literature
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660]   that will allow you to use different so-called wavelengths,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.280]   which most of us think of as colors of light,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.600]   in order to modulate your health
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.980]   in the ways that are most important to you.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.980]   For those of you that are thinking
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.800]   that the use of light to modulate health
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.680]   falls under the category of woo science,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.120]   pseudoscience, or biohacking,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.820]   well, nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.140]   In fact, in 1903, the Nobel Prize was given
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.700]   to Niels Vinson, he was Icelandic, he lived in Denmark,
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.800]   for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of lupus.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.140]   So there's more than 100 years of quality science
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.680]   emphasizing the use of light,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.960]   and as you'll soon see,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   the use of particular wavelengths or colors of light
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.360]   in order to modulate the activity of cells
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   in the brain and body.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.380]   So while it is the case that many places
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.360]   and companies are selling therapies and products
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.520]   related to the use of flashing lights and colored lights,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.440]   promising specific outcomes
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.820]   from everything from stem cell renewal
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.040]   to improvement of brain function,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.420]   and some of those don't have any basis in science,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320]   there are phototherapies that do have
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.480]   a strong foundation in quality science,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   and those are the studies and the protocols
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240]   that we are going to discuss today.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.100]   But I thought that people might appreciate
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400]   knowing that over 100 years ago,
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160]   people were thinking about the use of light
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.640]   for the treatment of various diseases
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.780]   and for improving health,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.080]   and indeed, many of those therapies are used today
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.440]   in high quality hospitals and research institutions,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.100]   and of course, clinics and homes around the world.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220]   One of the more exciting examples of phototherapy
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.420]   in the last few years is the beautiful work
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.240]   of Dr. Glenn Jeffrey at University College London.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.260]   The Jeffrey Lab is known for doing pioneering
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.360]   and very rigorous research
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   in the realm of visual neuroscience.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.680]   And in the last decade or so,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.960]   they turned their attention to exploring the role
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.740]   of red light therapy for offsetting age-related vision loss.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.060]   What they discovered is that just brief exposures
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.960]   to red light early in the day
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.920]   can offset much of the vision loss
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   that occurs in people 40 years or older.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.780]   And what's remarkable about these studies
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.560]   is that the entire duration of the therapy
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.320]   is just one to three minutes done
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.080]   just a few times per week.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.360]   What's even more exciting
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.960]   is that they understand the mechanism by which this occurred.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.260]   The cells in the back of the eye
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.180]   that convert light information into electrical signals
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.000]   that the rest of the brain can understand
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.800]   and create visual images from,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   well, those cells are extremely metabolically active.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   They need a lot of ATP or energy.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   And as we age, those cells get less efficient
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   at creating that ATP and energy.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.960]   Exposure to red light early in the day,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.060]   and it does have to be early in the day,
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.900]   allowed those cells to replenish the mechanisms
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.960]   by which they create ATP.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.660]   I'll talk about these experiments
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.520]   in more detail later in the episode and the protocols
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.080]   so that you can apply those protocols should you choose.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.720]   But I use this as an example of our growing understanding
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   of not just that phototherapies work, but how they work.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.840]   And it is through the linking of protocols and mechanism
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.100]   that we, meaning all of us,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.600]   can start to apply phototherapies
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400]   in a rational, safe, and powerful way.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   I'm pleased to announce
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.080]   that I'm hosting two live events this May.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600]   The first live event will be hosted
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.280]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.880]   The second live event will be hosted
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.280]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.760]   Both are part of a lecture series
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.880]   entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.600]   during which I will discuss science
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.760]   and science-based tools for mental health,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.560]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.980]   And I should point out that while some of the material
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.640]   I'll cover will overlap with information covered here
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.280]   on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120]   and on various social media posts,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.280]   most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.160]   from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.680]   So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.040]   Portland on May 18th.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.120]   You can access tickets by going to Hubermanlab.com/tour,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.600]   and I hope to see you there.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.280]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.660]   that this podcast is separate
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.980]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.080]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.760]   to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.480]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.300]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also called AG1.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.240]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.680]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.340]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.400]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.660]   is that it covers my foundational vitamin,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.520]   mineral, and probiotic needs.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.960]   It also has adaptogens and things like zinc
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.680]   for immune system function,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.440]   but the probiotics are one of the key features in there.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.740]   I've done several podcasts on the gut microbiome,
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.600]   which are these trillions of microbiota
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.040]   that live in our digestive tract
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   and that are crucial for our immune system,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.460]   brain function, and so on.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.640]   One way to enhance our gut microbiome
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   to ensure that it's healthy
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.800]   is to make sure that we get the correct probiotics,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.300]   and Athletic Greens has the correct prebiotics
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.600]   and probiotics that ensure a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.060]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.860]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.180]   to claim a special offer.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.720]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.760]   that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.160]   while you're on the road, so in the car and on the plane.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.060]   I should mention that Athletic Greens is delicious.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.880]   I love the way it tastes.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.960]   I mix mine with some water
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.480]   and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.660]   The special offer is the five free travel packs
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.580]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.600]   Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.080]   for a tremendous number of biological functions.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.480]   Many of us who get sunlight get enough vitamin D3.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.560]   Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.500]   do not get enough vitamin D3.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.480]   So the year supply of vitamin D3 also has K2,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.400]   which is important for cardiovascular function,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.040]   for calcium regulation.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.720]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.060]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.620]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.380]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.660]   Nootropic is a smart drug.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.500]   And personally, I'm not a big fan
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.260]   of the concept of a smart drug,
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.180]   at least not the way that most people talk about smart drugs
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.480]   or nootropics, for the following reason.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.580]   Being smart involves various things.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.580]   There is creativity, there's focus,
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.540]   there's task switching, and so on.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.860]   And each one of those involves different operations
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.320]   in the brain, different neural circuits,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   different neurochemicals have to be deployed
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.380]   in order for us to, for instance, be very focused
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.100]   or for us to be very creative
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.380]   or for us to be able to switch tasks easily.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.700]   Thesis understands this.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.060]   And for that reason, they've developed custom nootropics
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.560]   that are aimed at getting your brain and body
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.020]   into particular states for particular types
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.940]   of work or physical activity.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.080]   In order to accomplish that,
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.700]   they've created unique blends of high quality ingredients.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.460]   And each of those blends is designed
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.660]   to get your brain and body into a particular mode,
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.240]   such as focus, clarity, or motivation.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.300]   I've been using thesis nootropics for over six months now.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.340]   And I have to say, it's been a total game changer
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.280]   and very unique from the experience
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.120]   of using sort of what I call catch-all nootropics.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.880]   So with thesis, it's really directed
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.940]   toward particular brain body states.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.780]   I should also mention
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.100]   that they tailor those custom blends to you.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.920]   So by taking a quiz on their site,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.260]   they will tailor the blend to you and your specific needs
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.620]   and the things you don't want.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.460]   So if you want to try
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.220]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.860]   you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.100]   You'll take a three minute quiz
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.140]   and thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.420]   to try in your first month.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.380]   And then based on the outcomes with those,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.480]   they can update your formulations for you.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.500]   That's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.160]   and use the code Huberman at checkout

[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.660]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.340]   Element is a properly balanced electrolyte drink
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.320]   that has no sugar.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.820]   When we get our electrolytes in the proper ratios,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.480]   the cells of our brain and body can function optimally.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.020]   Many people are surprised to find
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.120]   that when they increase their sodium intake,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.100]   provided that it is in proper balance
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   with potassium and magnesium,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.040]   they can think more clearly.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.240]   They recover from exercise better and they have more energy.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.460]   There is no surprise as to how that all works however.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.500]   Every cell of your body requires the electrolytes
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.900]   to function and in particular,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.460]   the neurons of your brain and body
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   require sodium in order to function.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.820]   So while people with pre-hypertension and hypertension
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.880]   definitely need to be careful about increasing
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.900]   their sodium intake,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.780]   many people do well to increase their sodium intake,
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.000]   again, provided it's in the proper balance
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.820]   with potassium and magnesium.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.240]   Element provides that proper balance.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.880]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.860]   that's lmnt.com/huberman

[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.860]   Okay, let's talk about light.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.460]   First, I want to talk about the physics of light
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.980]   and I promise to make that very clear
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.740]   even if you don't have a background in physics.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.620]   And then I want to talk about the biology of light,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.680]   meaning how light is converted into signals
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.860]   that your brain and body can use
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.260]   to impact things like organ health or disease
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.960]   or how you can use light in order to repair
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.940]   particular organs like your skin,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.080]   your eyes, your brain, et cetera.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.140]   The physics of light can be made very simple
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.840]   by just illustrating a few key bullet points.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.640]   The first bullet point is that
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.720]   light is electromagnetic energy.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.640]   If the word electromagnetic feels daunting to you,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.860]   well then just discard that
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.640]   and just think of light as energy
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.220]   and think of energy as something that can impact
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.700]   other things in its environment.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.080]   Now, the way to imagine light
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.380]   or to conceptualize light as energy
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.620]   is that all around you,
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.580]   light is traveling in these little wavelengths.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.200]   And the reason for those of you that are watching,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm making a little wavy motion with my hand
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.900]   is that's actually the way that light energy moves
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.020]   in little waves,
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.740]   just like sound waves are coming at you
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.000]   and impinging on your ears.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.260]   If you can hear me talking right now, that is happening.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.100]   Those are sound waves,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.020]   meaning the movement of air particles out there
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.180]   impacting your eardrum.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.740]   Well, light energy is just little bits
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.100]   of electromagnetic energy traveling
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.740]   through your environment all the time in these little waves
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.740]   and impinging on your brain and body and eyes, et cetera.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.180]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.740]   energy can change the way that other things behave.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.180]   It can cause reactions in cells of your body.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.000]   It can cause reactions in fruit, for instance, right?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.320]   You see a piece of fruit and it's not ripe,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.000]   but it gets a lot of sunlight and it ripens.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.260]   That's because the electromagnetic energy of sunlight
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.360]   had an impact on that plant or that tree,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   or even on the fruit directly.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.180]   As a parallel example of energy
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.380]   and its ability to impact other things,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.760]   we are all familiar with food
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.800]   and the fact that food has calories.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.420]   Calorie is a measure of energy.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.500]   It has everything to do with how much heat is generated
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.800]   when you burn a particular article of food,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.840]   believe it or not.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.680]   And it turns out that how hot a given article of food burns
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.320]   gives you a sense of how much energy
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.560]   it can provide your body in terms of your body's ability
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.920]   to store or use that energy.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.860]   So again, think of light as electromagnetic energy,
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.980]   but really put that word energy into capital letters,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.900]   embed that in your mind going forward,
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.560]   and you'll understand most of the first bullet point
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.860]   of what light is in terms of the physics of light.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860]   Now, the second thing that you need to understand
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.100]   about the physics of light
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.740]   is that light has many different wavelengths.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.620]   And the simplest way to conceptualize this
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.680]   is to imagine that cover of that Pink Floyd album
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.760]   where there's a prism,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.660]   you have a white beam of light going into that prism,
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.140]   and then the prism splits that beam of light
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.080]   into what looks like a rainbow.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.660]   So you've got your red, your orange, your greens,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.820]   your blues, your purples, et cetera.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.080]   Anytime we have light in our environment
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.740]   that is so-called white light,
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.680]   it includes all those wavelengths,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   but sunlight and other forms of light
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.020]   also have other wavelengths of light that we can't see.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.380]   So when we think about the rainbow,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.100]   that's just the visible spectrum of light.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.020]   There are also wavelengths of light
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.420]   that are not visible to us,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.280]   but that are visible to some other animals
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.140]   and that can still impact your brain and body
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.920]   because there is still energy at those wavelengths.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.940]   I'll give a few examples of this.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.420]   Humans are not a species that can see
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.380]   into the infrared realm of the spectrum.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.960]   A pit viper, meaning a snake that has infrared sensors,
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.900]   however, can sense in the infrared.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.980]   So if you were to walk through a jungle
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.640]   and there's a pit viper there,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.340]   it sees you as a cloud of heat emission
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.180]   because your body is emitting infrared energy all the time.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.740]   You're casting off infrared energy.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.780]   The snake can see it, you can't.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.700]   If you were to put on a particular set of goggles
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.220]   that were infrared goggles,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.580]   well, then you would be able to see the heat emissions
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.020]   of any organism, human or otherwise,
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.860]   that could emit infrared energy.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.940]   Let's take the opposite end of the spectrum.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.660]   We are familiar with seeing things that are blue or green
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.740]   or very pale blue, but as we say below that,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.440]   meaning even shorter wavelength light is out there.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.960]   Ultraviolet light is a really good example
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   of light energy that's coming from the sun
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.280]   and is in our environment
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.720]   and is being reflected off surfaces all the time.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.400]   We don't see it and yet if it's very bright outside,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.280]   that ultraviolet light can burn our skin.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.080]   As you'll learn in today's episode,
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.760]   ultraviolet light can also positively impact us.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.860]   In fact, I will describe a particular set of new results
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.640]   that show that ultraviolet light viewed
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.160]   for just a few minutes each day
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.560]   or landing on the skin for just a few minutes each day
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.440]   can actually offset a lot of pain.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.960]   It actually has the ability to reduce the amount of pain
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   sensed by your body and we now understand
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.760]   the specific circuits in the brain and body
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.200]   that allow that to happen.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.040]   I'll talk about that
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.320]   in the related protocols a little bit later.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.520]   So the important thing to understand
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.840]   about the physics of light
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.320]   is that there's energy at all these different wavelengths.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   We only see some of those wavelengths,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.040]   which basically is to say that light impacts us
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.340]   at many different levels.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.000]   And the so-called levels that I'm referring to
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.080]   are the different wavelengths of light.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.160]   And you're welcome to think of the different wavelengths
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.720]   of light as different colors,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.240]   but do understand that there are truly colors of light
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.380]   that you and I can't see and yet that have powerful impact
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.440]   on your brain and body.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.460]   Now, the third bullet point to understand
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.880]   about the physics of light
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.240]   is that different wavelengths of light
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.880]   because of the way that their wave travels
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.800]   can penetrate tissues to different depths.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.960]   This is very, very important.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.400]   Today, we're going to talk a lot about red light therapies
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.920]   and near infrared light therapies.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.280]   Those are so-called longer wavelengths.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.360]   Longer wavelength, just think of a bigger, longer wave,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.680]   a bigger curve, as opposed to short wavelength light,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.780]   which is going to be shorter.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.780]   A short wavelength light would be something like blue
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.720]   or green light or ultraviolet light.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.840]   Blue, green, and ultraviolet light,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.640]   because it's short wavelength light,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.620]   doesn't tend to penetrate tissues very easily.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.520]   It has to do with the way that the physics of light
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.780]   interacts with the physical properties of your skin
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.200]   and other tissues of your body.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.240]   But basically, if you were to shine UV light
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.000]   onto your arm, for instance,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.200]   it could impact the skin on the surface of the arm
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.880]   and maybe some of the cells
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.980]   just beneath the top layer of skin,
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.880]   but it wouldn't penetrate much deeper.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.960]   Long wavelength light like red light and near infrared light
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   has this amazing ability to penetrate through tissues,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.280]   including your skin.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.440]   And so if we were to shine red light
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   or near infrared light onto your arm,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.880]   it would pass through that top layer of skin.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.460]   It might impact it a little bit,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.800]   but it could penetrate deeper into your skin,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.980]   not just to the skin layers,
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.640]   but maybe even down to the bone,
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.540]   maybe even down to the bone marrow.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.800]   And for many people, this will be hard to conceptualize.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.360]   You think, well, wait, I've got a skin there.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.800]   Doesn't the light just bounce off?
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.940]   And the answer is no,
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.540]   because of the way that long wavelength light
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.520]   interacts with the absorbance properties of your skin.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.040]   Absorbance properties is just the way
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.160]   that the skin takes light energy
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.280]   and converts it into a different form of energy.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.780]   And your skin is not able to take long wavelength light
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.340]   like red light and near infrared light and absorb it,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.640]   but the tissues deeper in your body can.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.200]   So if you shine red light or near infrared light
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.500]   onto the surface of your skin,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.040]   you'll see a red glow there as a reflectance
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.440]   on the surface of your skin.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.720]   But a lot of the photon energy,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.000]   the light energy in those longer wavelengths
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.840]   is indeed passing through those top layers of skin
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.400]   into the deeper layers of skin
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.640]   and can even make it into the deep layers of your arm.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.880]   And as we start to transition from the physics of light
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.920]   to the biological impacts of light,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.380]   just understanding that the different wavelengths of light
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.280]   impact our tissues at different levels,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.920]   literally at different depths,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.840]   will help you better understand
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.200]   how light of different colors, of different intensities,
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.620]   and how long you are exposed to those colors
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.320]   and intensities of light can change the way
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.700]   that the cells and the organs of your body work.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.040]   And if it didn't sound weird enough
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.800]   that you can pass light through particular tissues
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.740]   and have them land and be absorbed
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.480]   at tissues deeper in your body,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.520]   well, it turns out that different wavelengths of light
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.920]   are also best absorbed by particular
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.520]   so-called organelles within your cells.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.360]   What are organelles?
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.240]   Organelles are the different compartments
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.900]   and different functions within a given cell.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.420]   So for instance, your mitochondria,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.520]   which are responsible for generating ATP
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.880]   and energy in your cells,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.980]   those exist at a particular depth,
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.560]   at a particular location within a cell.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.920]   They're not all at the cell surface.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.760]   They sit somewhat deeper in the cell.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.120]   The nucleus of your individual cells contains DNA,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.620]   and that sits at a particular depth
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.120]   or location within your cell.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.720]   Different wavelengths of light
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.480]   not only can penetrate down into different tissues
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.600]   and into different cells of your body,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.540]   but they can also penetrate and access particular organelles,
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.180]   meaning mitochondria or the nucleus
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.040]   or the different aspects of your cells
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.400]   that are responsible for different functions.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.340]   This is exquisitely important and it's exquisitely powerful
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.760]   because as you'll learn today,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.160]   particular wavelengths of light
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.160]   can be used to stimulate the function of particular organelles
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.000]   within particular cells
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.560]   within particular organs of your body.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.780]   I can think of no other form of energy,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.800]   not sound, not chemical energy, so not drugs,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.720]   not food, not touch,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   no form of energy that can target the particular locations
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.640]   in our cells, in our organelles, in our organs,
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.400]   and in our body to the extent that light can.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.660]   In other words, if you had to imagine
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.660]   a real-world surgical tool by which to modulate our biology,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.640]   light would be the sharpest
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.840]   and the most precise of those tools.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.280]   Now let's talk about how light is converted
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.040]   into biological signals.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.600]   There are several ways in which that is accomplished,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.200]   but the fundamental thing to understand
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.020]   is this notion of absorption of light energy.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.440]   Certain pigments or colors
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.800]   in the thing that is receiving the light energy,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.360]   meaning the thing that the light energy lands on
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.480]   are going to absorb particular wavelengths of light.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.320]   Now, I promise you that you already intuitively know
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.700]   how this works.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.280]   For instance, if you were to sit outside
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.080]   on a very bright sunny day
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.520]   and you had a table in front of you that was metal,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.000]   you might find it hard to look down at that metal table
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.900]   because it's reflecting a lot of light
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.200]   of particular wavelengths.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.000]   If that table were pitch black, however,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.520]   it wouldn't reflect quite as much
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.880]   and you would be able to comfortably look at it.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.860]   If that table were red, it might be somewhere in between.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.820]   If that table were green,
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.700]   it would be also somewhere in between,
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.520]   but let's say it were very light blue,
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.720]   well, then it might reflect almost as much as a table
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.400]   that were just metal or a white table surface.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.420]   So the absorbance properties of a given surface
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.600]   will determine whether or not light energy goes
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.080]   and stays at that location
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.280]   and has an impact on that location,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.220]   or whether or not it bounces off.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.720]   Every biological function of light
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.040]   has to do with the absorbance or the reflectance of light
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.780]   or light passing through that particular thing,
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.960]   meaning that particular cell or compartment within a cell.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.520]   I'd like to make it clear how this works
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   by using the three primary examples
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.920]   of how you take light in your environment
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.620]   and convert it into biological events.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.960]   We have photoreceptors in the back of our eyes.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.680]   These photoreceptors come in two major types,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.340]   the so-called rods and the cones.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.260]   The rods are very elongated, they look like rods,
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.980]   and the cones look like little triangles.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.800]   Rods and cones have within them photopigment.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.300]   They have dark stuff that's stacked up in little layers.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.380]   Rods absorb light of essentially any wavelength.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.720]   There's some variation to that,
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.020]   but let's just say rods don't care
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.900]   about the different colors of light.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.700]   They will absorb light energy, photon energy,
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.320]   if it's red, if it's green, if it's blue, if it's yellow,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.160]   doesn't matter as long as that light is bright enough.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.480]   And it turns out that rods are very, very sensitive.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.760]   They can detect very, very small numbers of photons.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.140]   And rods are essentially what you use
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.400]   to see in very low light conditions.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.440]   We'll return more to vision later.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.920]   The cones come in three major varieties,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.960]   at least for most people who aren't colorblind,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.300]   you have so-called red cones, green cones, and blue cones,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.800]   but they're not really red, green, and blue
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.900]   in the back of your eye.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.680]   They are cones that either absorb long wavelength light,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.080]   red, that absorb medium wavelength light, green,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.160]   or short wavelength light, blue.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.280]   The reason that they can absorb different wavelengths
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.740]   of light is they have different photopigments.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.920]   So much as the example I gave before,
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.580]   where you have different tables outside
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.760]   in the sunny environment,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.660]   and some are reflecting light more than others,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.460]   others are absorbing light more than others.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.120]   Well, so too the photoreceptors,
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.280]   meaning the cones are absorbing light
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.720]   of different wavelengths to different extents.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.560]   And in a absolutely incredible way,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.000]   your brain is actually able to take that information
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.360]   and create this perception that we have of color.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.840]   But that's another story altogether
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.500]   that we'll just touch on a little bit more later,
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.040]   but that if you want to learn all about,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.840]   you can go to our episode on vision.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.760]   So that's photoreceptors in the back of your eye
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.100]   absorbing light of different wavelengths, rods and cones.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.180]   The other place, of course,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.180]   where light can impact our body is on our surface,
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.620]   on our skin.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.640]   And skin has pigment too.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.960]   We call that pigment melanin.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.840]   We have within our skin multiple cell types,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.180]   but in the top layer of skin,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.060]   which is called the epidermis,
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.340]   we have keratinocytes and we have melanocytes.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.700]   And the melanocytes are the cells
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.340]   that create pigmentation of the skin.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.760]   And of course, there is wide variation in the degree
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.160]   to which there's pigmentation of the skin,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.580]   which has to do with genetics,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.100]   also has to do with where you were born and raised,
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.720]   how much light exposure you have throughout the year, right?
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.000]   So people toward the equator
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.900]   tend to have more melanocyte activity
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.380]   than people who are located at the North Pole.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.260]   And of course, people live at different locations
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.100]   throughout the earth,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.920]   regardless of their genetic background
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.860]   or where they were born.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.380]   And so, as you all know, with light exposure,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.560]   those melanocytes will turn on genetic programs
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.360]   and other biological programs
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.720]   that lead to enhanced pigmentation on the skin,
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   which we call tanning.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.700]   The way they do that is by absorbing UV light specifically.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.580]   So with melanocytes, we have a very specific example
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.300]   of how a pigment absorbs light of a particular length,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.200]   in this case, ultraviolet short wavelength light,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.860]   which in turn creates a set of biological signals
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.840]   within those cells
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.000]   that in turn creates changes in our skin pigmentation.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.200]   So we have photoreceptors, we have melanocytes.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.240]   And the third example I'd like to provide
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.640]   is that of every cell of your body.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.360]   And what I mean by that is that every cell of your body,
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.540]   meaning a cell that is part of your bone tissue
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.760]   or your bone marrow or heart tissue or liver or spleen,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.520]   if light can access those cells,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.780]   it will change the way that those cells function
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.340]   for better or for worse.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.640]   For many organs within our body
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.060]   that reside deep to our skin,
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.320]   light never arrives at those cells.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.600]   A really good example of this that we'll touch on later
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.400]   is the spleen.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.560]   Unless you have massive damage to your body surface,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.760]   unless you literally have a hole in your body,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.060]   light will never land directly on your spleen.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.760]   But the spleen still responds to light information
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.120]   through indirect pathways.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.920]   And those indirect pathways arise through light
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.600]   arriving on the skin and light arriving on the eyes.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.740]   So a key principle that I'm going to return to
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.200]   again and again today is that the ways in which light
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.600]   can impact the biology of your organelles, your cells,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.500]   your organs and the tissues and indeed your whole body
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.360]   can either be direct.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.240]   So for instance, light onto your skin impacting skin
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.780]   or light onto your photoreceptors
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.060]   impacting the photoreceptors of your eye.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.880]   Or it can be indirect.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.920]   It can be light arriving on your photoreceptors,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.880]   the photoreceptors then informing another cell type
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.720]   which informs another cell type,
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.880]   which then relays a signal in kind of a bucket brigade
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.620]   manner off to the spleen and says to the spleen,
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.360]   hey, there's a lot of UV light out here.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.080]   We're actually under stress.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.680]   In fact, there's so much UV light
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.720]   that you need to activate an immune program
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.080]   to protect the skin.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.160]   And in response to that,
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.920]   the spleen can deploy certain signals and certain cell types
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.380]   to go out and start repairing skin that's being damaged
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.400]   by UV light.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.360]   So we have direct signals and we have indirect signals,
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.960]   but in every case,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.260]   it starts with light of particular wavelengths
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.880]   being absorbed by particular pigments or properties
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.300]   of the surfaces that those light waves land on.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.840]   And as you recall from our discussion
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.060]   about the physics of light,
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.460]   remember it's not just about light impinging
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.560]   on the surface of your body.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.920]   Light can actually penetrate deep to the skin
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.800]   and access at least certain tissues and cells of your body.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.400]   Even though you can't see those wavelengths of light,
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.980]   they are getting into you all the time.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.080]   So perhaps the best way to wrap this discussion
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.120]   about the physics and the biology of light
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.800]   with a bit of a bow
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.240]   is to think about light as a transducer,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.880]   meaning a communicator of what's going on
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.720]   in the environment around you.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.120]   And that some of those signals are arriving at the surface
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.220]   and impacting the surface of your body.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.060]   But many of those signals are being taken by cells
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.800]   at the surface of your body,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.520]   meaning your melanocytes in your skin
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.280]   and the photoreceptors of your eyes,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.320]   and then being passed off as a set of instructions
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.720]   to the other organs and tissues of your body.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.920]   Light can impact our biology in very fast,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.480]   moderately fast and slow ways.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.180]   But even the slow ways in which light can impact our biology
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.340]   can be very powerful and very long lasting.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.120]   Just as a quick example of the rapid effects of light
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.920]   on our biology.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.320]   If you were to go from a room that is dimly lit or dark
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.060]   into a very brightly lit room,
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.560]   you would immediately feel very alert.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.960]   You might say, no, that's not true.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.040]   Sometimes I wake up and it's dark and I kind of stumble out
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.980]   and it's lighter out in the next room
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.500]   and it takes me a while to wake up.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.040]   Ah, but if we were to move you from a room
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.060]   that was very dark to very bright,
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.840]   a signal conveyed from your eyes
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.140]   to an area of your brainstem called the locus coeruleus
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.740]   would cause the release of adrenaline
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.480]   similar to the release of adrenaline
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.980]   if you were to be dropped into very, very cold water
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.820]   all of a sudden.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.360]   You just had an immediate wake up signal
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.500]   to your brain and body.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.420]   So that's an example of a rapid effect of light
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.500]   on your biology.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.720]   Not a very typical one, but nonetheless,
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.500]   one that has a hardwired biological mechanism.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.520]   At the other end of the spectrum
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.460]   are what we call slow integrating effects of light
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.940]   on our biology.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.720]   So what I mean by that are ways in which
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.260]   your body is taking information about light
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.720]   in the environment, not in the sort of snapshot acute sense,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.500]   but averaging the amount of light in your environment.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.240]   And that average light information
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.940]   is changing the way that your biology works.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.620]   But even though this is a slow process,
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.460]   as I mentioned before, it's a very powerful one.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.500]   The primary example of this
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.300]   are so-called circannual rhythms.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.820]   Circannual rhythms are literally a calendar
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.420]   that exists within your body that uses not numbers,
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.820]   but amounts of hormone that are released
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.820]   into your brain and body each day and each night
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.100]   as a way of knowing where you are
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.520]   in the 365 day calendar year.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.900]   Now that might seem kind of crazy, but it's not crazy.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.020]   The earth travels around the sun once every 365 days.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.220]   And depending on where you are on the earth,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.020]   where you live, you are going to get more or less light
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.520]   each day on average, depending on the time of year.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.800]   So if you're in the Northern hemisphere
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.900]   in the winter months, days are shorter, nights are longer.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.980]   In the summer months, days are longer, nights are shorter.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.340]   And of course, things change whether or not
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.060]   you're in the Northern hemisphere
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.660]   or the Southern hemisphere.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.140]   But nonetheless, in short days,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.840]   you have more darkness, that's obvious.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.660]   And if you understand that light arriving on the eyes
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.140]   is absorbed by a particular cell type
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.020]   called the intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.620]   it's just a name, you don't need to know the name,
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.740]   but if you want, it's the so-called
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.420]   intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.280]   also called the melanopsin cell,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.600]   because it contains an opsin, a photopigment
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.920]   that absorbs short wavelength light
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.700]   that arrives through sunlight,
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.460]   those cells communicate to particular stations in the brain
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.640]   that in turn connect to your so-called pineal gland,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.400]   which is this little pea-sized gland
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.660]   in the middle of your brain
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.600]   that releases a hormone called melatonin.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.060]   And the only thing you need to know
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.160]   is that light activates these particular cells,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.500]   the intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells,
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.420]   which in turn shuts down the production of melatonin
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.640]   from the pineal gland.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.480]   If you think about this in terms of the travel of the earth
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.940]   around the sun across the year,
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.560]   what it means is that in short days,
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.040]   because there's very little light on average
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.700]   landing on these cells,
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.140]   the duration of melatonin release will be much longer
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.620]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.540]   light inhibits, it shuts down melatonin.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.340]   Whereas in the summer months,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.540]   much more light on average will land on your eyes, right?
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.960]   Because days are longer,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.420]   even if you're spending more time indoors,
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.500]   on average, you're going to get more light
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.140]   to activate these cells.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.600]   And because light shuts down melatonin production,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.280]   what you'll find is that the duration of melatonin release
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.380]   for the pineal is much shorter.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.460]   So melatonin is a transducer.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.580]   It's a communicator of how much light on average
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.960]   is in your physical environment.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.820]   What this means is for people living
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.420]   in the Northern hemisphere,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.540]   you're getting more melatonin release in the winter months
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.640]   than you are in the summer months.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   So you have a calendar system that is based in a hormone,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.420]   and that hormone is using light in order to determine
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.160]   where you are in that journey around the sun.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.500]   Now, this is beautiful, at least to me, it's beautiful,
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.860]   because what it means is that the environment around us
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.820]   is converted into a signal
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.860]   that changes the environment within us.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.780]   That signal is melatonin.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.180]   And melatonin is well-known for its role
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.860]   in making us sleepy each night
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.780]   and allowing us to fall asleep.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.200]   Many of you have probably heard before,
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.900]   I am not a big fan of melatonin supplementation
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.160]   for a number of reasons, but just as a quick aside,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.340]   the levels of melatonin that are in most supplements
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.480]   are far too high to really be considered physiological.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.180]   They are indeed super physiological in most cases,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.920]   and melatonin can have a number of different effects,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.140]   not just related to sleep,
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.680]   but that's supplemented melatonin.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.360]   Here, I'm talking about our natural production
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.460]   and release of melatonin,
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.740]   according to where we are in the 365-day calendar year.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.220]   Endogenous melatonin,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.380]   meaning the melatonin that we make within our bodies
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.560]   naturally, not melatonin that's supplemented,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.760]   has two general categories of effects.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.140]   The first set of effects are so-called regulatory effects,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.900]   and the others are protective effects.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.780]   The regulatory effects are, for instance,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.540]   that melatonin can positively impact bone mass.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.300]   So melatonin can, for instance,
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.800]   turn on the production of osteoblasts,
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.820]   which are essentially stem cells that make more bone for us,
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.420]   that make our bones stronger,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.040]   and that can replace damaged aspects of our bone.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.940]   Melatonin is also involved in maturation of the gonads
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.860]   during puberty, the ovaries, and the testes.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.620]   Although there, the effects of melatonin
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.300]   tend to be suppressive on maturation
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.780]   of the ovaries and testes,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.620]   meaning high levels of melatonin
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.520]   tend to reduce testicle volume
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   and reduce certain functions within the testes,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.580]   including sperm production and testosterone production.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.420]   And within the ovaries,
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.580]   melatonin can suppress the maturation of eggs, et cetera.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.020]   Now, I don't want anyone to get scared
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.540]   if you've been taking melatonin.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.880]   Most of the effects of melatonin on those functions
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.180]   are reversible,
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.260]   but I should point out that one of the reasons
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.660]   why children don't go into puberty until a particular age
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.540]   is that young children tend to have
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.760]   chronically high endogenous melatonin,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.380]   and that is healthy to keep them out of puberty
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.700]   until it's the right time for puberty to happen.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.400]   So melatonin can increase bone mass,
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.860]   but reduces gonad mass, so to speak.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.740]   It's going to have varying effects
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.460]   depending on the ratios and levels of other hormones
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.220]   and other biological events in the body.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.140]   But as you can see,
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.500]   melatonin has these powerful regulatory effects
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.540]   on other tissues.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.140]   I should also mention that melatonin
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.120]   is a powerful modulator of placental development.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.500]   So for anyone that's pregnant,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.860]   if you're considering melatonin supplementation,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.540]   please, please, please talk to your OBGYN,
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.980]   talk to your other doctor as well.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.380]   You want to be very, very cautious
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.660]   because of the powerful effects that melatonin can have
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.900]   on the developing fetus and placenta.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.080]   For people that are not pregnant,
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.020]   in fact, all people,
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.660]   melatonin has a powerful effect
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.960]   on the central nervous system as a whole.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.980]   Your brain and spinal cord are the major components
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.460]   of your central nervous system,
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.180]   and melatonin, because it's associated with darkness,
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.200]   which is just another way of saying
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.880]   that light suppresses melatonin,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.180]   melatonin is thereby associated with the dark phase
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.660]   of each 24 hour cycle,
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.700]   it can have a number of different effects
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.340]   in terms of waking up or making our body feel more sleepy.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.420]   And it does that by way of impacting cells
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.460]   within our nervous system,
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.040]   literally turning on certain brain areas,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.580]   turning off other brain areas.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.060]   And it does that through a whole cascade
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.460]   of biological mechanisms,
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   a bit too detailed to get into today.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.000]   So melatonin is regulating how awake or asleep we are.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.940]   It tends to make us more asleep, incidentally.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.860]   It's regulating our timing of puberty
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.300]   and it's regulating how our gonads,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.900]   the testes and ovaries function,
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.780]   even in adulthood to some extent,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.420]   and it's regulating bone mass.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.240]   As I mentioned before,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.480]   melatonin also has protective effects.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.140]   It can activate our immune system.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.500]   It is among the most potent antioxidants.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.140]   So it is known to have certain anti-cancer properties
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.620]   and things of that sort,
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.120]   which is not to say that you simply want more melatonin.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.860]   I think a lot of people get misled
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.100]   when they hear something like melatonin
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.960]   has anti-cancer properties.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.580]   That doesn't mean that just cranking up
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.060]   the levels of melatonin by supplementing it,
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.540]   or by spending time in darkness and not getting any light,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.140]   which would of course inhibit melatonin
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.500]   is going to be beneficial for combating cancer.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.540]   That's not the way it works.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.980]   It is actually the rise and fall of melatonin
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.660]   every 24 hour cycle,
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.480]   and the changes in the duration of that melatonin signal
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.780]   throughout the seasons that has these anti-cancer
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.300]   and antioxidant effects.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.100]   So when we think about light impacting our biology,
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.660]   the reason I bring up melatonin
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.740]   as the primary example of that is A,
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.220]   because melatonin impacts so many important functions
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.420]   within our brain and body,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.840]   but also because hormones in general, not always,
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.220]   but in general are responsible
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.660]   for these slow modulatory effects on our biology.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.780]   And so I'm using this as an example
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.740]   of how light throughout the year
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.660]   is changing the way that the different cells and tissues
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.060]   and organs of your body are working,
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.300]   and that melatonin is the transducer of that signal.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.140]   So at this point,
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.060]   we can say light powerfully modulates melatonin,
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.700]   meaning it shuts down melatonin.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.420]   Melatonin is both beneficial for certain tissues
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.220]   and suppressive for other tissues and functions.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.780]   What should we do with this information?
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.860]   Well, it's very well established now
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.100]   that one of the best things that we can all do
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.580]   is to get the proper amount of sunlight each day.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.340]   And by proper, I mean appropriate for that time of year.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.540]   So in the summer months where the days are longer
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.780]   and nights are shorter,
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.220]   we would all do well to get more sunlight in our eyes.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.100]   And again, it's going to be to our eyes
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.220]   because as you recall, the pineal sits deep in the brain
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.320]   and light can't access the pineal directly,
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.820]   at least not in humans.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:22.620]   So in order to get light information to the pineal
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.240]   and thereby get the proper levels of melatonin,
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.560]   according to the time of year,
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.900]   we should all try and get outside as much as possible
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.140]   during the long days of summer and spring.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.340]   And in the winter months,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.720]   it makes sense to spend more time indoors.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.820]   For those of you that suffer
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.180]   from seasonal affective disorder,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.460]   which is a seasonal depression
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.180]   or feel low during the fall and winter months,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.300]   there are ways to offset this.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.880]   We did an entire episode on mood and circadian rhythms
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.100]   where we described this.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.480]   So it does make sense for some people
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.920]   to get more bright light in their eyes early in the morning
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.020]   and throughout the day during the winter months as well.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.380]   But nonetheless, changes in melatonin,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.060]   meaning changes in the duration of melatonin release
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.100]   across the year are normal and healthy.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.760]   So provided that you're not suffering from depression,
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.540]   it's going to be healthy to somewhat modulate your amount
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.260]   of indoor and outdoor time across the year.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.240]   The other thing to understand
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.040]   is this very firmly established fact,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.140]   which is light powerfully inhibits melatonin.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.960]   If you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.320]   and you go into the bathroom and you flip on the lights,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.480]   and those are very bright overhead fluorescent lights,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.040]   your melatonin levels,
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.160]   which would ordinarily be quite high
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.000]   in the middle of the night,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.820]   because you've been eyes closed in the dark presumably,
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.000]   will immediately plummet to near zero or zero.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.020]   We would all do well regardless of time of year
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.540]   to not destroy our melatonin
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.380]   in the middle of the night in this way.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.940]   So if you need to get up in the middle of the night
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.780]   and you use the restroom,
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.860]   which is a perfectly normal behavior for many people,
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.940]   use the minimum amount of light required
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.080]   in order to safely move through the environment
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.580]   that you need to move through.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.440]   Melatonin needs to come on early in the night.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.280]   It actually starts rising in the evening and towards sleep.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.200]   But then as you close your eyes and you go to sleep,
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.680]   melatonin levels are going to continue to rise
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.780]   at least for several hours into the night.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.200]   Again, if you get up in the middle of the night,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.920]   really try hard not to flip on a lot of bright lights.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.480]   If you do that every once in a while,
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.000]   it's not going to be a problem.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.960]   But if you're doing that night after night,
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.440]   you are really disrupting this fundamental signal
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.980]   that occurs every night,
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.280]   regardless of winter, spring, summer, et cetera,
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.480]   and that is communicating information
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.040]   about where your brain and body should be in time.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.900]   And I know that's a little bit of a tricky concept,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.840]   but really our body is not meant to function
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.320]   in the same way during the winter months
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.520]   as the summer months.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.000]   There are functions that are specifically optimal
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.620]   for the shorter days of winter,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.800]   and there are functions that are specifically optimal
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   for the longer days of summer.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.520]   So again, try to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.560]   in the middle of the night.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   And for those of you that are doing shift work,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.100]   what I can say is try and avoid getting bright light
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.060]   in your eyes in the middle of your sleep cycle.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.440]   So even if you're sleeping in the middle of the day,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.720]   because you have to work at night,
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.160]   if you wake up during that bout of sleep,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.360]   really try hard to limit the amount of light,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.580]   which is going to be harder for shift workers, right?
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.420]   Because there are generally a lot more lights on
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.640]   and bright lights outside too.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.080]   You would want to close the blinds
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.400]   and limit artificial light inside.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.260]   One way to bypass some of the inhibitory effects of light
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.980]   on melatonin is to change your physical environment
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.000]   by, for instance, dimming the lights.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   That's one simple way, very low cost way.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.760]   In fact, you'll save money by dimming the lights
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.700]   or turning them off.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.120]   The other is if you are going to use light
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.700]   using long wavelength light,
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.840]   because as you recall,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.040]   these intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.740]   within your retina that convey the signal
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.420]   about bright light in your environment to impact melatonin,
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.740]   to shut down melatonin,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.840]   respond to short wavelengths of light.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.880]   So red light is long wavelength light.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.760]   You now understand that from our discussion
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.620]   about the physics of light.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.400]   And if you were to use amber colored light or red light,
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.680]   and even better dim amber or dim red light
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.520]   in the middle of the night,
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.100]   well, then you would probably not reduce melatonin at all,
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.040]   unless those red lights and amber lights
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.080]   are very, very bright.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.260]   Any light, provided it's bright enough,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.860]   will shut down melatonin production.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.900]   One final point about melatonin,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.960]   and this relates to melatonin supplementation as well,
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.340]   is that now that you understand how potently melatonin
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.220]   can impact things like cardiovascular function,
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.160]   immune function, anticancer properties,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.340]   bone mass, gonad function, et cetera,
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.680]   you can understand why it would make sense
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.980]   to be cautious about melatonin supplementation,
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.480]   because supplementation tends to be pretty static.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.460]   It's X number of milligrams per night.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.220]   Whereas normally, endogenously,
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.420]   the amount of melatonin that you're releasing each night
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.140]   is changing according to time of year.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.340]   Or if you happen to live in an area
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.940]   where there isn't much change in day length across the year.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.140]   So for instance, if you live near the equator,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.920]   well, then your body is accustomed
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.020]   to having regular amounts of melatonin each night.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.180]   When you start supplementing melatonin,
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.240]   you start changing the total amount of melatonin, obviously,
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   but you're also changing the normal rhythms
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.980]   in how much melatonin is being released
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.000]   into your brain and body across the 365 day calendar year.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.940]   So while I'm somebody who readily embraces supplementation
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.360]   in various forms for things like sleep and focus, et cetera,
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.080]   when it comes to melatonin, I'm extremely cautious.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.580]   And I think it's also one of the few examples
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.820]   where a hormone is available without prescription
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.660]   over the counter.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.020]   You can just go into a pharmacy or drug store,
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.620]   order online this hormone,
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.880]   which is known to have all these powerful effects.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.620]   So I get very, very concerned
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.740]   when I hear about people taking melatonin,
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.380]   especially at the levels that are present
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.560]   in most supplements.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.580]   It's been recognized for a very long time.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.540]   And in fact, there are now data to support the fact
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.580]   that animals of all kinds, including humans,
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.860]   will seek out mates and engage in mating behavior
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.140]   more frequently during the long days of spring and summer.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.820]   That's right, in seasonally breeding animals,
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.860]   of course, this is the case, but in humans as well,
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.780]   there is more seeking out of mates and mating behavior
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.840]   in longer day times of year.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.540]   Now you could imagine at least two mechanisms
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.520]   by which this occurs.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.360]   The first mechanism we could easily map to melatonin
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.000]   and the fact that melatonin is suppressive
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.440]   to various aspects of the so-called gonadal axis,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.020]   which is basically a fancy way of saying
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.700]   that melatonin inhibits testosterone and estrogen output
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.100]   from the testes and from the ovaries.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.280]   I just want to remind people that both males and females
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.680]   make testosterone and estrogen,
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.820]   although in different ratios,
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.580]   typically in males versus females,
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.720]   and that both testosterone and estrogen are critical
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.860]   for the desire to mate and for mating behavior.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.860]   There's a broad misconception that testosterone
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.280]   is involved in mating behavior
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.980]   and estrogen is involved in other behaviors,
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.640]   but having enough estrogen is critical
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.920]   for both males and females
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.060]   in order to maintain the desire to mate
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.160]   and indeed the ability to mate.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.960]   I discussed this on the episode
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.320]   on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.940]   So if you'd like more details on that,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.300]   please see that episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.840]   Okay, so if melatonin is suppressive
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.380]   to the so-called gonadal axis
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.660]   and reduces overall levels of testosterone and estrogen
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.520]   in males and females, and light inhibits melatonin,
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.700]   then when there's more light, then there's less melatonin
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.540]   and more hormone output from the gonads.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.700]   And indeed that's how the system works,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   but that's not the entire story.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.100]   It turns out that there is a second
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.780]   so-called parallel pathway,
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.500]   meaning a different biological pathway
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.300]   that operates in parallel
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.460]   to the light suppression of melatonin pathway
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.980]   that provides a basis for longer days inspiring more desire
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.040]   to mate and more mating behavior.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.220]   So if we think of the first pathway involving melatonin
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.480]   as sort of a break on these reproductive hormones,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.100]   the second mechanism is more like an accelerator
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.060]   on those hormones, and yet it still involves light.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.740]   As I'm about to tell you, in animals such as mice,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.320]   but also in humans, exposure to light,
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.120]   in particular UV blue light, so short wavelengths of light,
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.180]   can trigger increases in testosterone and estrogen
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.800]   and the desire to mate.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.640]   Now what's especially important about this accelerator
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.820]   on the desire to mate and mating behavior and hormones
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.920]   is that it is driven by exposure to light,
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.740]   but it is not the exposure of light to the eyes.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.120]   It turns out that it is the exposure of your skin
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.200]   to particular wavelengths of light
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.840]   that is triggering increases in the hormones,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.460]   testosterone and estrogen,
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.020]   leading to increased desire to mate.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.220]   As it turns out, your skin,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.400]   which most of us just think of as a way
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.340]   to protect the organs of our body
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.300]   or something to hang clothes on or ornaments on
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.440]   if you're somebody who has earrings and so forth,
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.340]   your skin is actually an endocrine organ,
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.180]   meaning it is a hormone producing
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.360]   and hormone influencing organ.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.680]   I promise what I'm about to tell you next
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.600]   will forever change the way that you think about your skin
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.760]   and light and the desire to mate
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.400]   and indeed even mating behavior.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.580]   I think the results are best understood
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.000]   by simply going through the primary data,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.360]   meaning the actual research on this topic.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.560]   And to do so, I'm going to review a recent paper
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.960]   that was published in the journal Cell Reports,
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.080]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.360]   This is a paper that came out in 2021
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.640]   entitled Skin Exposure to UVB Light
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.080]   Induces a Skin Brain GONAD Axis and Sexual Behavior.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.760]   And I want to emphasize that this was a paper
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.560]   that focused on mice in order to address specific mechanisms
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.400]   because in mice, you can so-called knock out
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.540]   particular genes, you can remove particular genes
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.600]   to understand mechanism.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.160]   You just can't do that in humans
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.980]   in any kind of controlled way,
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.440]   at least not at this point in time.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.360]   And this study also explores humans
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.840]   and looked at human subjects, both men and women.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.240]   The basic finding of this study was that when mice
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.280]   or humans were exposed to UVB,
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.600]   meaning ultraviolet blue light,
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.120]   so short wavelength light of the sort
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.960]   that comes through in sunshine,
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.300]   but is also available through various artificial sources.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:39.180]   If they received enough exposure of that light
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:44.100]   to their skin, there were increases in testosterone
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.000]   that were observed within a very brief period of time,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.080]   also increases in the hormone estrogen.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.760]   And I should point out that the proper ratios of estrogen
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.800]   and testosterone were maintained in both males and females,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.740]   at least as far as these data indicate.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   And mice tended to seek out mating more and mate more.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.580]   There were also increases in gonadal weight,
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.260]   literally increases in testes size and in ovarian size
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.040]   when mice were exposed to this UVB light
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.500]   past a certain threshold.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.160]   Now, as I mentioned before, the study also looked at humans.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.940]   They did not look at testes size or ovarian size
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.240]   in the human subjects.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   However, because they are humans,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.960]   they did address the psychology of these human beings
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.680]   and address whether or not they had increases in,
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.800]   for instance, aggressiveness or in passionate feelings
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.660]   and how their perception of other people changed
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.320]   when they were getting a lot of UVB light exposure
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.200]   to the skin.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.360]   So before I get into some of the more important details
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.040]   of the study and how it was done
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.760]   and how you can leverage this information for yourself,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.800]   if you desire, I just want to highlight
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.600]   some of the basic findings overall.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.380]   UVB exposure increased these so-called sex steroid levels
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.680]   in mice and humans.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.780]   The sex steroid hormones, when we say steroids,
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.480]   we don't mean anabolic steroids taken exogenously.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.880]   I think when people hear the word steroids,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.640]   they always think steroid abuse or use.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.900]   Rather steroid hormones such as testosterone and estrogen
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:18.300]   went up when mice or humans had a lot of UVB exposure
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.200]   to their skin.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.780]   Second of all, UVB light exposure to the skin
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.640]   enhanced female attractiveness.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.780]   So the perceived attractiveness of females by males
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.880]   and increase the receptiveness or the desire to mate
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.340]   in both sexes.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.640]   UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.020]   of female biology related to fertility,
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.480]   in particular, follicle growth.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.820]   Follicle and egg maturation are well-known indices
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.160]   of fertility and of course correlate with the menstrual
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.860]   cycle in adult humans and is related overall
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.200]   to the propensity to become pregnant.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.340]   UVB light exposure enhanced maturation of the follicle,
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.540]   which just meant that more healthy eggs were being produced.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.880]   These are impressive effects.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.400]   First of all, they looked at a large number of variables
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.500]   in the study and the fact that they looked at mice
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.140]   and humans is terrific.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.060]   I think that oftentimes we find it hard to translate data
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:13.900]   from mice to humans.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.260]   So the fact that they looked at both in parallel
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.160]   is wonderful.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.260]   In the mice and in the humans,
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.500]   they established a protocol that essentially involved
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.820]   exposing the skin to UV light that was equivalent
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.340]   to about 20 to 30 minutes of midday sun exposure.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.060]   Now, of course, where you live in the world
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.700]   will dictate whether or not that midday sun
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.640]   is very, very bright and intense or is less bright.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.360]   Maybe there's cloud cover, et cetera.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.080]   But since I'm imagining that most people are interested
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.560]   in the ways to increase testosterone and or estrogen
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.840]   in humans and are not so much interested
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.060]   in increasing testosterone in mice,
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.800]   I'm going to just review what they did
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.900]   in the human population or the human subjects.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.920]   What they did is they had people first of all,
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.320]   establish a baseline and the way they establish a baseline
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.640]   was a little bit unusual,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.520]   but it will make perfect sense to you.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.940]   They had people wear long sleeves and essentially cover up
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.780]   and avoid sunlight for a few days
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.720]   so they could measure their baseline hormones
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.680]   in the absence of getting a lot of UVB light exposure
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.600]   from the sun or from other sources.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.840]   Now, of course, these people had access
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.980]   to artificial lights,
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.040]   but as I've pointed out on this podcast before,
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.420]   it's pretty unusual that you'll get enough UVB exposure
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.000]   from artificial lights throughout the day
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.660]   and in the morning, you need a lot of UVB exposure
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.440]   or we should be getting a lot of UVB exposure
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.400]   to our eyes and to our face and to our skin
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.700]   throughout the day, provided we're not getting sunburn.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.600]   This is actually a healthy thing for mood
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.180]   and for energy throughout the day.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.880]   It's only at night, basically between the hours
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:48.740]   of about 10 PM and 4 AM that even a tiny bit of UVB exposure
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.760]   from artificial sources can mess us up
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.420]   in terms of our sleep and our energy levels and so on
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.840]   and that's because of the potent effect of UVB
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.040]   on suppressing melatonin.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.200]   So the point here is that they establish a baseline
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   whereby people were getting some artificial light exposure
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.660]   throughout the day, but they weren't getting outside a lot.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.360]   They weren't getting a lot of sunlight.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.700]   And then they had people receive a dose
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.020]   of UVB light exposure.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.820]   That was about 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.320]   They had people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.880]   Some people wore sleeveless shirts.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.560]   They encouraged people to wear shorts.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.960]   So they were indeed wearing clothing.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.920]   They were not naked and they were wearing clothing
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.440]   that was culturally and situationally appropriate
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.360]   at least for the part of the world where this study was done
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.120]   and they had people do that two or three times a week.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   So in terms of a protocol that you might export
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.980]   from this study, basically getting outside
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.320]   for about 30 minutes, two or three times a week
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.520]   in a minimum of clothing and yet still wearing
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.920]   enough clothing that is culturally appropriate.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.160]   They were outside, they weren't sunbathing,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.560]   flipping over on their back and front.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.720]   They were just moving about doing things they could read.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.520]   They could talk, they could go about other activities
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.540]   but they weren't wearing a broad brim hat
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.800]   or a hat of any kind, just getting a lot of sun exposure
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.640]   to their skin.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.960]   They did this for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.040]   So this took several weeks, right?
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.400]   It took about a month if you think about it,
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.760]   two or three times per week for a total
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.280]   These treatments of course are just being outside
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.880]   in the sun and then they measured hormones
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.180]   and they measured the psychology of these male
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.920]   and female adult subjects.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.080]   Let's first look at the psychological changes
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.960]   that these human subjects experienced
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.060]   after getting 10 to 12 of these UVB light exposure,
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.360]   outdoor and sunlight type treatments.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.080]   They did this by collecting blood samples
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.940]   throughout the study and they saw significant increases
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.720]   in the hormones beta estradiol,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.240]   which is one of the major forms of estrogen,
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.400]   progesterone, another important steroid hormone
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.680]   and testosterone in both men and women.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.200]   Now an important point is that the testosterone increases
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.640]   were significantly higher in men that happened
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.000]   to originate from countries that had low UV exposure
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.520]   compared to individuals from countries
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.960]   with high UV exposure.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.340]   Now this ought to make sense if we understand a little bit
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.980]   about how the skin functions as an endocrine organ.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.040]   Many of you have probably heard of vitamin D3,
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.680]   which is a vitamin that we all make.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.180]   Many people supplement it as well
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.100]   if they need additional vitamin D3.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.800]   We all require sunlight in order to allow vitamin D3
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.160]   to be synthesized and perform its roles in the body.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.120]   And it turns out that people who have darker skin
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:39.680]   actually need more vitamin D3 and or more sunlight exposure
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.180]   in order to activate that D3 pathway
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.240]   than do people with paler skin.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.440]   And this should make sense to all of you
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.160]   given what you now understand about melanocytes,
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.720]   that cell type that we discussed earlier
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.800]   because melanocytes have pigment within them.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.640]   And if you have darker skin,
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.260]   it means that you have more melanocytes
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.120]   or that you have melanocytes that are more efficient
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.960]   at creating pigment.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:07.680]   And as a consequence, the light that lands on your skin
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.380]   will be absorbed by those melanocytes
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.720]   and less of it is able to impact the D3 pathway.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.040]   Whereas if you have pale skin,
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.080]   more of the light that lands on your skin
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.880]   can trigger the synthesis and assist the actions
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.340]   of vitamin D3.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.560]   Similarly, in this study,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.760]   they found that people who had paler skin
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.180]   and or who originated from countries
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.260]   where they had less UVB light exposure across the year
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.480]   had greater meaning more significant increases
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.880]   in testosterone overall than did people
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.080]   who already were getting a lot of UVB exposure.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.800]   This led them to explore so-called seasonal changes
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.680]   in testosterone that occurred normally in the absence
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.660]   of any light exposure treatment.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.640]   So up until now, I've been talking about the aspects
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.140]   of this study involving people getting outside
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.960]   for about 20 to 30 minutes per day in sunlight
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.440]   in a minimum of clothing.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.840]   There was an increase in testosterone observed
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.240]   in both men and women.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   The increases in testosterone were greater for people
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.520]   that had paler skin than darker skin.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.220]   So the data I'm about to describe
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.920]   also come from this same paper,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.360]   but do not involve 20 to 30 minute
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.080]   daily sun exposure protocols.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.660]   It's simply addressing whether or not testosterone levels
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.540]   change as a function of time of year.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.820]   They measured testosterone across the 12 month calendar.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.660]   This study was done on subjects living
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.180]   in the Northern hemisphere for the entire year.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.500]   And so in the months of January, February, and March,
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:38.620]   of course, the length of days is shortest
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.060]   and the length of nights is longest.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.620]   And of course, in the spring and summer months,
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.700]   June, July, August, September, and so on,
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.760]   the days are much longer and the nights are shorter.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.600]   And what they observed was very obvious.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.380]   They observed that testosterone levels were lowest
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   in the winter months and were highest in the months
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.260]   of June, July, August, and September.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.040]   Now, these are very important data.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.880]   At least to my knowledge,
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.840]   these are the first data systematically exploring
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.960]   the levels of sex steroid hormones in humans
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.420]   as a function of time of year and thereby as a function
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.980]   of how much sunlight exposure they're getting.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.060]   And what's remarkable about these data is
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.660]   that they map very well to the data in mice
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:23.560]   and the other data in this paper on humans,
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:28.000]   which illustrate that if you're getting more UVB exposure,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.780]   your testosterone levels are higher.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.940]   This study went a step further and explored whether
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.740]   or not the amount of sunlight exposure
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:36.060]   that one is getting to their skin influences
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.740]   their psychology in terms of whether
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.560]   or not they have increased desire to mate and so on.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.940]   It's well known that sunlight exposure
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.760]   to the eyes can increase mood.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.040]   And I talked about this in the podcast episode
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.980]   with my guest, Dr. Samir Hatar,
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.760]   who's the director of the Chronobiology Unit
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.380]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.260]   And Samir's recommendation is that people get
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.800]   as much bright light exposure as they safely can
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.620]   in the morning and throughout the day for sake
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.980]   of both sleep and energy, but also for enhancing mood
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.860]   and regulating appetite.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.100]   In this study, it was found that both males
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.340]   and females had higher levels of romantic passion
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.140]   after getting the UV treatment.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.860]   In fact, some of them reported increases
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.560]   in romantic passion from just one
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.480]   or two of these UV treatments.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.160]   So they didn't have to go through all 10 or 12
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.960]   in order to get a statistically significant increase
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.400]   in passion.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.020]   Now, when we talk about passion,
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.980]   as the authors of this paper acknowledge,
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.940]   there's really two forms.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.640]   There is emotional and sexual,
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.380]   and they parse this pretty finely.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.920]   I don't want to go into all the details
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.740]   and we can provide a reference and link to this study
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.740]   if you'd like to look at those details.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.100]   But what they found was that women receiving
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.500]   this UVB light exposure focused more on increases
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.740]   in physical arousal and sexual passion,
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.700]   whereas the men actually scored higher
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.580]   on the cognitive dimensions of passion,
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.220]   such as obsessive thoughts about their partner and so on.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.220]   Regardless, both males and females experienced
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.420]   and reported a increase in sexual passion
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.880]   and desire to mate.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.580]   And we now know there were increases in testosterone
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.940]   and estrogen, which of course could be driving
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.180]   the psychological changes.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.820]   Although I'm sure that those interact in both directions,
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:19.380]   meaning the hormones no doubt affect psychology
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.180]   and no doubt the psychology,
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.940]   these changes in passionate feelings,
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.420]   no doubt also increased or changed
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.920]   the hormone levels as well.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.620]   And I want to reemphasize that there was a component
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   of the study that had no deliberate daylight,
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.340]   sunlight exposure for 20 or 30 minutes,
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.500]   but rather just looked at hormone levels
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:42.400]   throughout the year and found that the increase
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.420]   in day length correlated with increases
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.420]   in testosterone and sexual passion.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.140]   Now, my opinion, this is a very noteworthy study
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.740]   because it really illustrates that sunlight
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.420]   and day length can impact the melatonin pathway
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:00.580]   and thereby take the foot off the brake, so to speak,
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.980]   on testosterone, estrogen, and the desire to mate.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.220]   It also emphasizes that sunlight, UVB light,
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.360]   can directly trigger hormone pathways
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.080]   and desire to mate and mating behavior.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.460]   Now, this study went a step further
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.500]   in defining the precise mechanism
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.740]   by which light can impact all these hormones
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.540]   and this desire to mate.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.660]   And here, understanding the mechanism is key
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.140]   if you want to export a particular protocol
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.800]   or tool that you might apply.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.700]   We talked earlier about how UVB light exposure
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.380]   to the eyes triggers activation
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.620]   of these particular neurons within the eye
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.940]   and then with centers deeper in the brain
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.780]   and eventually the pineal gland
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.140]   to suppress the output of melatonin
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.020]   and thereby to allow testosterone and estrogen
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.180]   to exist at higher levels
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.580]   because melatonin can inhibit testosterone and estrogen.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.100]   In this study, they were able to very clearly establish
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.460]   that it is sunlight exposure to our skin
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.420]   that is causing these hormone increases
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.120]   that they observed in mice and humans.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.020]   And the way they did that was to use
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.640]   the so-called knockout technology,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.700]   the ability to remove specific genes
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.100]   within specific tissues of the body.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.600]   And what they found is that UVB light,
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.000]   meaning sunlight exposed skin upregulated,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.980]   meaning increased the activity of something called P53,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.020]   which is involved in the maturation of cells
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.980]   and various aspects of cellular function.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.840]   And the cells they were focused on were the keratinocytes,
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.520]   which you are now familiar with from our earlier discussion
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.100]   about the fact that the epidermis of your skin
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.980]   contains mainly keratinocytes and melanocytes.
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:43.020]   Sunlight exposure increased P53 activity in the skin
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:46.220]   and P53 activity was required
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.420]   for the downstream increases in ovarian size,
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.680]   in testicular size, in testosterone increases,
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.540]   in the estrogen increases
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.460]   and the various other changes that they observed
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.980]   at the physiological level
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:03.060]   when animals or humans were exposed to sunlight.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.060]   So these data are important
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.900]   because what they mean is that not only is it important
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.820]   that we get sunlight exposure early in the day
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.660]   and throughout the day to our eyes,
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.000]   at least as much as is safely possible,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.700]   but that we also need to get UVB sunlight exposure
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:21.020]   onto our skin if we want to activate this P53 pathway
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:25.660]   in keratinocytes and the testosterone and estrogen increases
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.380]   that are downstream of that P53 pathway.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.220]   So even though the gene knockout studies were done on mice,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.580]   they clearly show that if you remove P53 from the skin,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.220]   that these effects simply do not occur.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.600]   So in terms of thinking about a protocol
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.540]   to increase testosterone and estrogen,
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.860]   mood and feelings of passion,
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.420]   the idea is that you would want to get
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.620]   this two to three exposures per week minimum
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.460]   of 20 to 30 minutes of sunlight exposure
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.440]   onto as much of your body
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.380]   as you can reasonably expose it to.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.020]   And when I say reasonably, I mean,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.360]   of course you have to obey cultural constraints,
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.180]   decency constraints, and of course you have to also obey
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.620]   the fact that sunlight can burn your skin.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.020]   So many people are probably going to ask,
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.980]   what happens if you wear sunscreen?
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.700]   In theory, because sunscreen has UV protection,
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.840]   it would block some of these effects.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.380]   Now I'm not suggesting that people do away
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.540]   with sunscreen entirely.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.140]   I do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.000]   in the future because sunscreen
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.960]   is a bit of a controversial topic.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.720]   Skin cancers are a real thing
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.620]   and many people are especially prone to skin cancer.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.540]   So you need to take that seriously.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.800]   Some people are not very prone to skin cancers
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.620]   and can tolerate much more sun exposure.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.480]   You're probably familiar with the simple fact
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.900]   that if you've gone outside on the beach with friends,
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.960]   some people get burned very easily, others don't.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.440]   So you really should prioritize the health
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.840]   and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.740]   However, these data and other data point to the fact
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.500]   that we should all probably be striving
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.460]   to get more sunlight exposure
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.680]   onto our skin during the winter months
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.620]   and still getting sunlight exposure
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.020]   onto our skin in the summer months,
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.740]   provided we can do that without damaging our skin.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.640]   Another set of very impressive effects of UVB light,
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.740]   whether or not it comes from sunlight
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.920]   or from an artificial source,
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.400]   is the effect of UVB light on our tolerance for pain.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.320]   It turns out that our tolerance for pain
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.160]   varies across the year
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.360]   and that our pain tolerance is increased
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.120]   in longer day conditions.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.840]   And as we saw with the effects of UVB
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.640]   on hormones and mating,
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.100]   again, this is occurring via UVB exposure to the skin
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.120]   and UVB exposure to the eyes.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.720]   I want to just describe two studies
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.480]   that really capture the essence of these results.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.500]   I'm going to discuss these in kind of a top contour fashion.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.220]   I won't go into it as quite as much depth
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.400]   as I did the last study,
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.960]   but I will provide links to these studies as well.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.880]   The first study is entitled
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.560]   skin exposure to ultraviolet B rapidly activates
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.520]   systemic neuroendocrine and immunosuppressive responses.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.400]   And you might hear that and think,
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.860]   oh, immunosuppressive, that's bad.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.520]   But basically what they observed
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.200]   is that even one exposure to UVB light
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.440]   changed the output of particular hormones
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.060]   and neurochemicals in the body,
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.640]   such as corticotropin hormone and beta endorphins,
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.720]   which are these endogenous opioids.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.280]   We've all heard of the opioid crisis,
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.440]   which is people getting addicted to opioids
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.800]   that they are taking in drug form, pharmaceuticals.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.040]   But here I'm referring to endorphins
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.520]   that our body naturally manufactures and releases
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.240]   in order to counter pain
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.080]   and act as a somewhat of a psychological soother also,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.360]   because of course, physical pain and emotional pain
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.720]   are intimately linked in the brain and body.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.940]   What they found was that exposure to UVB light
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.040]   increased the release of these beta endorphins.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.600]   It caused essentially the release
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.380]   of an endogenous painkiller.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:03.000]   Now, a second study that came out very recently,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.780]   just this last week in fact,
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.020]   published in the journal neuron,
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.260]   cell press journal, excellent journal,
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.880]   is entitled a visual circuit
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.380]   related to the periaqueductal gray area
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.300]   for the anti-nociceptive effects of bright light treatment.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.980]   I'll translate a little bit of that for you.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.620]   The periaqueductal gray is a region of the midbrain
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.160]   that contains a lot of neurons
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.840]   that can release endogenous opioids.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.800]   Things like beta enkephalin, things like enkephalin,
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.200]   things like mu opioid.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.320]   These are all names of chemicals
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.640]   that your body can manufacture
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.600]   that act as endogenous painkillers
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.480]   and increase your tolerance for pain.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.880]   They actually make you feel less pain overall
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.360]   by shutting down some of the neurons that perceive pain
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.640]   or by reducing their activity, not to a dangerous level.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.140]   They're not going to block the pain response
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.620]   so that you burn yourself unnecessarily
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.140]   or harm yourself unnecessarily,
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.520]   but they act as a bit of a painkiller from the inside.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.240]   If you heard the word anti-nociceptive,
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.160]   nociception is basically the perception
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.400]   or the way in which neurons respond to painful stimuli.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.680]   So you can think of nociceptive events
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.040]   in your nervous system as painful events.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.720]   And there I'm using a broad brush.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.520]   I realized that the experts in pain will say,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.460]   "Oh, it's not a really a pain circuit, et cetera, et cetera."
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.840]   But for sake of today's discussion,
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.480]   it's fair to say that nociception is the perception of pain.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.120]   So if this title is a visual circuit
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.320]   related to the periaqueductal gray,
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.200]   which is this area that releases these endogenous opioids
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.560]   for the anti-nociceptive,
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.360]   the anti-pain effects of bright light treatment.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.520]   The key finding of this study
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.220]   is that it is light landing on the eyes
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.080]   and captured by the specific cells
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.980]   I was talking about earlier,
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.220]   those intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin ganglion cells
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.060]   is the long name for them.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.940]   But these particular neurons in your eye
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.300]   and in my eye, incidentally,
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.580]   that communicate with particular brain areas.
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.180]   These brain areas have names if you want to know them
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.740]   for you aficionados or for you ultra curious folks,
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.100]   they have names like the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.580]   and the intergeniculate leaflet.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.780]   The names don't matter.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.400]   The point is that light landing on the eyes
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.680]   is captured by these melanopsin cells.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.000]   They absorb that light,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.220]   translate that light into electrical signals
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.000]   that are handed off to areas of the brain,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.440]   such as the ventral geniculate.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.880]   And then the ventral geniculate
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.280]   communicates with this periaqueductal gray area
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.960]   to evoke the release of these endogenous opioids
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.000]   that soothe you and lead to less perception of pain.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.360]   This is a really important study
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   because it's long been known that in longer days
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.620]   or in bright light environments,
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.380]   we tolerate emotional and physical pain better.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:51.300]   Previous studies had shown that it is light landing
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.460]   on our skin that mediates that effect, but only in part,
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.400]   it couldn't explain the entire effect.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.380]   This very recent study indicates
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.380]   that it's also light arriving at the eyes.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.700]   And in this case, again, UVB light,
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.380]   ultraviolet blue light of the sort that comes from sunlight,
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.700]   that is triggering these anti-pain or pain relieving pathways.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.200]   So once again, we have two parallel pathways.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.320]   This is a theme you're going to hear
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.380]   over and over and over again, not just in this episode,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.460]   but in all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.760]   because this is the way that your brain and body are built.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.920]   Nature rarely relies on one mechanism
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.200]   in order to create an important phenomenon.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.400]   And pain relief is an important phenomenon.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   So we now have at least two examples
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.960]   of the potent effects of UVB light exposure
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.580]   to the skin and to the eyes.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.280]   One involving activation of testosterone
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.340]   and estrogen pathways as it relates to mating,
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:50.200]   and another that relates to reducing the total amount
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.240]   of pain that we experience in response
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.200]   to any painful stimuli.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.160]   So for those of you that are thinking tools and protocols,
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.120]   if you're somebody who's experiencing chronic pain,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.760]   provided you can do it safely,
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.180]   try to get some UVB exposure, ideally from sunlight.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.920]   I think the 20 to 30 minute protocol,
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.520]   two or three times per week is an excellent one.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.280]   It seems like a fairly low dose of UVB light exposure.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.340]   It's hard to imagine getting much damage to the skin.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.740]   Of course, if you have very sensitive skin,
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.660]   or if you live in an area of the world that is very,
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.400]   very bright and has intense sunlight,
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.820]   particular times of year, you'll want to be cautious.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.460]   Heed the warnings and considerations about sunscreen
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.880]   that I talked about earlier or about wearing a hat.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.860]   But the point is very clear.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.260]   Most of us should be getting more UVB exposure
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.120]   from sunlight.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.540]   I can already hear the screams within the comments
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.620]   or the rather the questions within the comments saying,
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:46.220]   well, what if I live in a part of the world
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.760]   where I don't get much UVB exposure?
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.340]   And I want to emphasize something that I've also emphasized
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.540]   in the many discussions on this podcast related
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.460]   to sleep and circadian rhythms and alertness,
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.380]   which is even on a cloud covered day,
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:03.160]   you are going to get far more light energy photons
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.640]   through cloud cover than you are going to get
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.140]   from an indoor light source, an artificial light source.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.700]   I can't emphasize this enough.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.100]   If you look outside in the morning and you see some sunlight,
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.740]   if you see some sunlight throughout the day,
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.700]   you would do yourself a great favor to try
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.120]   and chase some of that sunlight and get into that sunlight,
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.020]   to expose your eyes and your skin to that sunlight,
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.140]   as much as you safely can.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.560]   And when I say as much as you safely can,
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.900]   never ever look at any light,
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.220]   artificial sunlight or otherwise that's so bright
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.300]   that it's painful to look at.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.080]   It's fine to get that light arriving
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.820]   on your eyes indirectly.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.340]   It's fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.540]   In fact, if you think about the biology of the eye
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.080]   and the way that those lenses work,
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.480]   that it will just serve to focus that light
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.740]   on to the very cells that you want those light beams
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.900]   to be delivered to.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.160]   Whereas sunglasses that are highly reflective
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.000]   or trying to get your sunlight exposure
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.080]   through a windshield of a car or through a window
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.940]   simply won't work.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.060]   I'm sorry to tell you,
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:06.220]   but most windows are designed to filter out the UVB light.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.020]   And if you're somebody who's really keen on blue blockers
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.000]   and you're wearing your blue blockers all day,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.020]   well, don't wear them outside.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.900]   And in fact, you're probably doing yourself a disservice
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.260]   by wearing them in the morning and in the daytime.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.100]   There certainly is a place for blue blockers
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.320]   in the evening and nighttime,
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.140]   if you're having issues with falling and staying asleep.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.020]   But if you think about it, blue blockers,
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:26.860]   what they're really doing
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:30.880]   is blocking those short wavelength UVB wavelengths of light
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.820]   that you so desperately need to arrive at your retina.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.940]   And of course, also onto your skin
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:38.620]   in order to get these powerful biological effects
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.680]   on hormones and on pain reduction.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.320]   And in terms of skin exposure,
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.540]   these data also might make you think a little bit
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.120]   about whether or not you should wear short sleeves
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.960]   or long sleeves,
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.780]   whether or not you want to wear shorts or a skirt or pants.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.920]   It's all going to depend on the context of your life
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.300]   and the social and other variables
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.800]   that are important, of course.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.540]   I don't know each and every one of your circumstances,
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:05.440]   so I can't tell you to do X or Y or Z, nor would I,
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.180]   but you might take into consideration
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.280]   that it is the total amount of skin exposure
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.180]   that is going to allow you to capture more or fewer photons,
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   depending on, for instance,
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.000]   if you're completely cloaked in clothing
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.420]   and you're just exposed in the hands, neck and face,
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.600]   such as I am now,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.100]   or whether or not you're outside in shorts and a t-shirt,
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:28.340]   you're going to get very, very different patterns
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.800]   of biological signaling activation
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.160]   in those two circumstances.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.900]   Many of you I'm guessing are wondering
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.120]   whether or not you should seek out UVB exposure
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.620]   throughout the entire year or only in the summer months.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.640]   And that's sort of going to depend
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.200]   on whether or not you experience depression
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.480]   in the winter months,
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.880]   so-called seasonal affective disorder.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.840]   Some people have mild,
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.280]   some people have severe forms of seasonal affective disorder.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.160]   Some people love the fall and winter and the shorter days.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.880]   They love bundling up, they love the leaves,
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.160]   they love the snow, they love the cold,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.120]   and they don't experience those psychological lows.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.920]   So it varies tremendously.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.800]   And there are genetic differences
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   and birthplace origin differences that relate to all this,
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.100]   but really it has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.040]   I personally believe,
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.440]   and this was reinforced by the director
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.020]   of the Chronobiology Unit
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.580]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health, Samir Hattar,
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.080]   that we would all do well to get more UVB exposure
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.740]   from sunlight throughout the entire year,
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.220]   provided we aren't burning our skin
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.380]   or damaging our eyes in some way.
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.780]   In addition to that, during the winter months,
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.020]   if you do experience some drop in energy
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:42.980]   or increase in depression or psychological lows,
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.460]   it can be very beneficial to access a sad lamp,
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.300]   or if you don't want to buy a sad lamp,
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.220]   'cause oftentimes they can be very expensive,
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:55.080]   you might do well to simply get a LED lighting panel.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.440]   I've described one before,
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.340]   and I want to emphasize that I have no affiliation
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.840]   whatsoever to these commercial sources,
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.680]   but I've described one before and I'll describe it again,
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.120]   and we can provide a link to a couple examples of these
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.400]   in the show notes, in the show note captions, excuse me.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.240]   This is a 932,000 lux, L-U-X,
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.360]   light source that's designed for drawing.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.720]   It's literally a drawing box.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.540]   It's a thin panel.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.480]   It's about the size of a laptop.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.680]   Very inexpensive compared to the typical sad lamp.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.500]   I actually have one and I position on my desk all day long.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.740]   I also have enough skylights above my desk.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.860]   I'm fairly sensitive to the effects of light.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:30.700]   So in longer days,
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.180]   I feel much better than I do in shorter days.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.720]   I've never suffered from full-blown
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.140]   seasonal affective disorder,
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.680]   but I keep that light source on throughout the day,
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.660]   throughout the year.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.500]   But I also make it a point to get outside
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:42.780]   and get sunlight early in the morning
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.520]   and several times throughout the day.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.220]   And if it's particularly overcast outside,
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.640]   or there just doesn't seem to be a lot of sunlight
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.920]   coming through those clouds,
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.500]   I will try to look at that light source
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.840]   a little bit more each day
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.380]   in order to trigger these mechanisms.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.120]   Now, some people may desire to get UVB exposure
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.120]   to their skin and they want to do that
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.960]   through sources other than sunlight.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.100]   And there it's a little bit more complicated.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.280]   There are of course, canning salons,
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.660]   which basically are beds of UVB light.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.160]   That's really all they are.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.080]   I've never been to one.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.600]   I know people do frequent them
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.100]   in certain parts of the world.
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.280]   There of course, people are covering their eyes.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.740]   They are only getting UVB exposure to their skin typically
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.880]   because the UVB exposure or intensities rather
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.520]   tends to be very, very high.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.880]   And so you can actually damage your eyes
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.900]   if you're looking at a very, very bright
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.500]   artificial UVB source up close.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.140]   So you really have to explore these options for yourself.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.120]   Sunlight, of course, being the original
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.740]   and still the best way to get UVB exposure.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.320]   So without knowing your particular circumstances,
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.340]   finances, genetics, or place of origin, et cetera,
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.820]   I can't know whether or not you need
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:49.860]   to use artificial sources.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.620]   You're going to have to gauge that.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:55.220]   Meanwhile, getting outside, looking at
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:59.280]   and getting some exposure of UVB onto your skin
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.940]   is going to be beneficial for the vast majority
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.340]   of people out there.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.480]   And in fact, it's even going to be beneficial
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.100]   for people that are blind.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.720]   People that are blind provided they still have eyes
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.200]   often maintain these melanopsin cells.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   So even if you're low vision or no vision,
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.480]   getting UVB exposure to your eyes can be very beneficial
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.220]   for sake of mood, hormone pathways,
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.360]   pain reduction, and so forth.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.760]   A cautionary note, people who have retinitis pigmentosa,
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.360]   macular degeneration, or glaucoma,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.680]   as well as people who are especially prone to skin cancers
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.640]   should definitely consult with your ophthalmologist
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.080]   and dermatologist before you start increasing
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.600]   the total amount of UVB exposure that you're getting
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.960]   from any source, sunlight or otherwise.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.880]   There are additional very interesting
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.200]   and powerful effects of UVB light,
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.460]   in particular on immune function.
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:57.320]   All the organs of our body are inside our skin.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.460]   And so information about external conditions,
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.200]   meaning the environment that we're in,
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.360]   need to be communicated to the various organs of our body.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.640]   Some of them have more direct access
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.600]   to what's going on outside.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.800]   So for instance, the cells in your brain
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.600]   that reside right over the roof of your mouth,
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.760]   your hypothalamus that control hormone output
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.560]   and then control the biological functions
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.960]   that we call circadian functions,
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.440]   the ones that change every 24 hours.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.060]   Well, those are just one or two connections,
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.760]   meaning synapses away from those cells in your eye
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.500]   that perceive UVB light, excuse me.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.960]   Other organs of your body, such as your spleen,
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.360]   which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.240]   that combat infection.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.940]   Well, those are a long ways away
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:43.880]   from those cells in your eye.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.240]   And in fact, they're a long ways away from your skin.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.980]   There are beautiful studies showing that
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.220]   if we get more UVB exposure from sunlight
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:55.980]   or from appropriate artificial sources,
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:00.800]   that spleen and immune function are enhanced.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.280]   And there's a very logical, well-established circuit
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.040]   as to how that happens.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.320]   Your brain actually connects to your spleen.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.080]   Now, it's not the case that you can simply think,
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.680]   okay, spleen, turn on, release killer cells,
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.380]   go out and combat infection.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:20.700]   However, UVB light arriving on the eyes
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.520]   is known to trigger activation of the neurons
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.040]   within the so-called sympathetic nervous system.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.360]   These neurons are part of the larger thing
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.120]   that we call the autonomic nervous system,
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.160]   meaning it's below or not accessible by conscious control.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.560]   It's the thing that controls your heartbeat,
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.020]   controls your breathing, and that also activates
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.000]   or flips on the switch of your immune system.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.560]   When we get a lot of UVB light in our eyes,
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.880]   or I should say sufficient UVB light in our eyes,
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.120]   a particular channel, a particular set of connections
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.220]   within the sympathetic nervous system is activated,
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.360]   and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.300]   that scavenge for and combat infection.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.860]   So if you've noticed that you get fewer colds and flus
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.780]   and other forms of illness in the summer months,
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.440]   part of that could be because of the increase in temperature
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440]   in your environment, because typically longer days
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.640]   are associated with more warmth in your environment,
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.480]   as opposed to winter days, which are short,
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.560]   when it tends to be colder out.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.960]   Well, that's true, but it's also the case
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.440]   the people around you have fewer colds and flus
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.640]   and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flus
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.480]   and other infections, because if those infections,
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.880]   whether or not they're bacterial or viral,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.380]   arrive in your body, right, if you inhale them
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.980]   or they get into your mouth or on your skin,
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.480]   your spleen meets those infections with a greater output.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.540]   In other words, the soldiers of your immune system,
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:50.200]   the chemicals and cell types of your immune system
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.200]   that combat infection are in a more ready deployed stance,
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.440]   if you will.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.120]   If you want to know more about the immune system
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.000]   and immune function, I did an entire episode
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.660]   about the immune system and the brain in a,
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:04.840]   you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.820]   We talk about cytokines, we talk about killer cells,
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.480]   B cells, T cells, et cetera, a lot of detail there.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.720]   So we often think about the summer months
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.320]   and the spring months as fewer infections floating around,
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.840]   but in fact, there aren't fewer infections floating around.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.460]   We are simply better at combating those infections
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:25.080]   and therefore there's less infection floating around.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.640]   So we are still confronted with a lot of infections.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.920]   We're just able to combat them better.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.360]   What does this mean in terms of a tool?
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.840]   What it means is that during the winter months,
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.560]   we should be especially conscious of accessing UVB light
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.320]   to enhance our spleen function,
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.700]   to make sure that our sympathetic nervous system
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:46.160]   is activated to a sufficient level
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.520]   to keep our immune system deploying all those killer T cells
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.100]   and B cells and cytokines
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.860]   so that when we encounter the infections,
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:54.740]   as we inevitably will, right,
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.740]   we're constantly being bombarded with potential infections
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:00.240]   that we can combat those infections well.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.980]   And as just a brief aside,
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.280]   but I should mention a brief aside that's related
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.240]   to tens of thousands of quality studies.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.540]   It is well known that wound healing is faster
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.900]   when we are getting sufficient UVB exposure.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.340]   Typically that's associated with the longer days
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:17.680]   of spring and summer.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.400]   It is known that turnover of hair cells,
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.580]   the very cells that give rise to hair cells
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:24.420]   are called stem cells.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:27.040]   They've lived in little so-called niches in our skin
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.560]   with these hair stem cells
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.000]   and your hair grows faster in longer days.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.440]   That too is triggered by UVB exposure,
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.520]   not just to the skin, but to the eyes.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.440]   That's right.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.720]   There was a study published in the Proceedings
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.120]   of the National Academy of Sciences a couple of years ago
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.460]   that showed that the exposure of those melanopsin ganglion
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.960]   cells in your eyes is absolutely critical
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.320]   for triggering the turnover of stem cells
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.340]   in both the skin and hair.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:58.640]   And also it turns out in nails.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.240]   So if you've noticed that your skin, your hair
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.560]   and your nails look better and turn over more,
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   meaning grow faster in longer days,
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.040]   that is not a coincidence.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.780]   That is not just your perception.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.520]   In fact, hair grows more, skin turns over more,
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.880]   meaning it's going to look more youthful.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.200]   You're going to essentially remove older skin cells
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.320]   and replace them with new cells.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.660]   And all the renewing cells and tissues of our body
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.800]   are going to proliferate, are going to recreate themselves
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.240]   more when we're getting sufficient UVB light to our eyes
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.960]   and also to our skin.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.200]   And so while some of you may think of light therapies,
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.560]   such as red light therapies or UVB therapies
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.000]   as kind of new agey or just biohacking,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.920]   again, a phrase I don't particularly like,
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.200]   this notion of biohacking,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.440]   'cause it implies using one thing for a purpose
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.700]   that it was never intended to have.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.240]   Well, it turns out that UVB exposure and red light,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.520]   as we'll soon see, is a very potent form
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.160]   of increasing things like wound healing and skin health
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.660]   for very logical mechanistically backed reasons.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.480]   So while I can't account for everything
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.860]   that's being promoted out there in terms of this light source
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.280]   will help your skin look more youthful
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.420]   or will help heal your scars,
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:17.560]   the mechanistic basis for light having those effects
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.160]   makes total sense.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.240]   But what you should consider, however,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.720]   is that if the particular light therapy
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.580]   that you're considering involves very local application
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:32.560]   rather than illuminating broad swaths of skin,
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.000]   and if it has no involvement with the eyes,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.860]   meaning there's no delivery of UVB or red light
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.400]   or the other light therapy to the eyes,
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.960]   it's probably not going to be as potent a treatment
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.120]   as would a more systemic activation
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.080]   of larger areas of skin and the eyes.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.800]   Now, again, a cautionary note,
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.480]   I don't want people taking technologies
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.500]   that were designed for local application
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.260]   and beaming those into the eyes.
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.040]   That could be very, very bad and damaging
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.540]   to your retinal and other tissues.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.280]   Certainly wouldn't want you taking bright light
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.440]   of very high intensity of any kind
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.560]   and getting cavalier about that.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.940]   Typically the local illumination of say a wound
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.360]   or a particular patch of acne
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.020]   or some other form of skin treatment
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.840]   involves very high intensity light.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.440]   And if the intensity is too high,
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.400]   you can actually damage that skin.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.880]   And so, as we'll talk about in a few moments,
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.380]   most of those therapies for modifying skin
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.360]   involve actually burning off a small,
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.480]   very thin layer at the top of the epidermis
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.640]   in efforts to trigger the renewal
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.000]   or the activation of stem cells
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.860]   that will replenish that with new cells.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.800]   So there's a fine line to be had
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.960]   between light therapies that are very localized and intense,
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.140]   which are designed to damage skin
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.500]   and cause reactivation of new stem cells,
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.740]   whether or not it's hair cells or skin cells, et cetera,
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.480]   versus systemic activation
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.340]   across broad swaths of skin in the eyes.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.860]   You really have to consider this on a case by case basis,
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.740]   but at least for now,
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.900]   just consider that increases in hormones,
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:10.660]   reduction in pain by way of increases in enkephalin
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.700]   and other endogenous opioids,
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   improving immune status by activating the spleen
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.360]   and so on and so on,
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.540]   really are all the downstream consequence
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.900]   of illuminating large swaths of skin
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.940]   and making sure that those neurons within the eye
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.240]   get their adequate UVB exposure
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.240]   or other light wavelength exposure,
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.340]   not simply beaming a particular wavelength of light
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.960]   at a particular location on the body
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.360]   and hoping that that particular illumination
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.100]   at a particular location on the body
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.460]   is going to somehow change the biology at that location.
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.320]   Our biology just really doesn't work that way.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.240]   It's possible, but in general,
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.420]   systemic effects through broad scale illumination
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.700]   and illumination to the eye
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.560]   combined with local treatments
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.340]   are very likely to be the ones that have the most success.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.680]   Now I'd like to shift our attention
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.980]   to the effects of light on mood more specifically.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:58.820]   We talked about this
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.680]   in terms of seasonal affective disorder,
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.380]   but many of us don't suffer from seasonal affective disorder.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.820]   So I'd like to drill a little deeper
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:07.620]   into how light impacts mood.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.540]   And here, I want to, again,
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.460]   paraphrase the statements of Dr. Samir Hattar
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.780]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.940]   I should mention the director of the Chronobiology Unit
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.660]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.660]   and perhaps one of the top one to two to three world experts
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.180]   in how light can impact mood, appetite,
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.780]   circadian rhythms, and so forth.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.040]   Samir stated on the podcast
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.220]   and he said in various other venues as well,
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.860]   that getting as much UVB light in our eyes
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.380]   and on our skin in the early day and throughout the day
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.500]   as a safely possible is going to be beneficial for mood.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.100]   There's also another time of day,
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.780]   or rather I should say a time of night
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:54.400]   in which UVB can be leveraged in order to improve mood,
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.900]   but it's actually the inverse
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.500]   of everything we've been talking about up until now.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.740]   We have a particular neural circuit
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:04.900]   that originates with those melanopsin cells in our eye
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.220]   that bypass all the areas of the brain
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:09.140]   associated with circadian clocks.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.540]   So everything related to sleep and wakefulness
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:14.760]   that's specifically dedicated to the pathways
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.980]   involving the release of molecules like dopamine,
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.900]   the neuromodulator that's associated with motivation,
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.120]   with feeling good,
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.540]   with feeling like there's possibility in the world
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.760]   and so on and so forth.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.060]   And other molecules as well, including serotonin
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.700]   and some of those endogenous opioids
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.100]   that we talked about before.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:34.340]   That particular pathway involves a brain structure
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.700]   called the perihabenular nucleus.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:39.700]   The perihabenular nucleus gets input
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.420]   from the cells in the eye that respond to UVB light
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:46.740]   and frankly to bright light of other wavelengths as well.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.440]   'Cause as you recall, if a light is bright enough,
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.340]   even if it's not UV or blue light,
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.820]   it can activate those cells in the eye.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.340]   Those cells in the eye communicate
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.380]   to the perihabenular nucleus.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.060]   And as it turns out, if this pathway is activated
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:04.740]   at the wrong time of each 24 hour cycle,
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.060]   mood gets worse.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.740]   Dopamine output gets worse.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:13.180]   Molecules that are there specifically to make us feel good
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:16.080]   actually are reduced in their output.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.420]   So while UVB exposure in the morning and throughout the day
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:24.380]   is going to be very important for elevating
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.500]   and maintaining elevated mood,
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:30.820]   avoiding UVB light at night is actually a way
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:34.900]   in which we can prevent activation of this
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.460]   eye to perihabenular pathway that can actually
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.900]   turn on depression.
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:41.640]   To be very direct and succinct about this,
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.940]   avoid exposure to UVB light from artificial sources
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:48.460]   between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM.
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.780]   And if you're somebody who suffers from low mood
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:54.660]   and overall has a kind of mild depression
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.460]   or even severe depression, of course,
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.340]   please see a psychiatrist, see a trained psychologist,
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.940]   get that treated.
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:05.940]   But you would do especially well to avoid UVB exposure
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.560]   from artificial sources, not just from 10 PM to 4 AM,
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.020]   but really be careful about getting too much exposure
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:14.380]   to UVB, even in the late evening.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.180]   So 8 PM perhaps to 4 AM.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:21.740]   I can't emphasize this enough that if you view UVB light,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.540]   you activate those neurons in your eye very potently.
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:28.060]   And if those cells communicate to the perihabenular nucleus,
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.700]   which they do, you will truncate or reduce
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.360]   the amount of dopamine that you release.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.140]   So if you want to keep your mood elevated,
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.880]   get a lot of light, UVB light throughout the day.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.840]   And at night, really be cautious about getting UVB exposure
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.120]   from artificial sources.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.940]   Now let's say you're somebody who has no issues with mood.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.500]   You're just the happiest person all year long,
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.520]   or maybe you just have subtle variations in your mood.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.820]   You feel great about that.
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.900]   Turns out that you still want to be very careful
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:02.040]   about light exposure between the hours of 10 PM or so
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:02.880]   and 4 AM.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.980]   In fact, even during sleep.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.800]   There's a recent study that just came out
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.720]   in the proceeds of the National Academy of Sciences.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.700]   And it's entitled light exposure during sleep
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.980]   in pairs cardiometabolic function.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.660]   This is a very interesting study
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.180]   where they took human subjects, young adults,
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.620]   and having them sleep in rooms
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.000]   that had different lighting conditions,
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.880]   either dim light or slightly bright light.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.440]   Now, many people can't fall asleep in brightly lit rooms.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.240]   So they acknowledge this.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.920]   These were not very brightly lit rooms.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.220]   These were rooms that had just a little bit
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:39.200]   of overhead room lighting, a hundred lux,
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.240]   which is not very bright at all.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.880]   Or they had them sleep in a room that had very dim light,
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.760]   which is less than three lux.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.120]   If you want to get a sense of how bright three lux is
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.720]   versus a hundred lux,
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.860]   I would encourage you to download the free app Light Meter.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.380]   I have no relationship to the app.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.220]   It's a pretty cool app.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.540]   However, I've used it for a long time
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.040]   where you can basically point your phone
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.320]   at a particular light source, sun or otherwise,
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.240]   and you just press the button.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.560]   It'll give you an approximate readout of lux,
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.760]   which is the light intensity that the phone happens
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.900]   to be staring out at at that location.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.300]   It's not exact, but it's a pretty good back
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.400]   of the envelope measure of light intensity.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.360]   So these subjects were either sleeping in a very dim room,
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.160]   three lux is very, very dim,
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.900]   or a somewhat dim room, a hundred lux.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:29.180]   In this study, they measured things like melatonin levels.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.920]   They looked at heart rate.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.880]   They looked at measures of insulin and glucose management.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.020]   Now, in previous episodes,
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.400]   I've talked about how glucose blood sugar
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.380]   is regulated by insulin
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:44.820]   because you don't want your glucose levels to be too high,
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:46.580]   hyperglycemia or too low.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.140]   Hypoglycemia and the hormone insulin is involved
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.480]   in sequestering and shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.360]   Basically how well you manage glucose in the bloodstream
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.460]   can be indirectly measured by your insulin levels.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.440]   And it's well-known that sleep deprivation
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.260]   However, in this study,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.120]   subjects were sleeping the whole night through.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.720]   It just so happens that some of the subjects
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.120]   were sleeping in this very dimly lit room, three lux,
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.360]   and other subjects were sleeping
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.720]   in a somewhat dimly lit room, a hundred lux.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.680]   What's incredible about this study
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.160]   is that both rooms were sufficiently dim
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.460]   that melatonin levels were not altered in either case.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.300]   This is really key.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:31.460]   It's not as if one group experienced a lot of bright light
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.600]   through their eyelids and others did not.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.520]   Melatonin levels were not disrupted.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.240]   And given how potently light can inhibit melatonin,
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.440]   this speaks to the fact that this very dim condition
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.840]   of three lux and the somewhat dim condition of a hundred lux
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.040]   was not actually perceived by the subjects,
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.720]   nor was it disrupting these hormone pathways.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.240]   They also looked at glucose responses.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.440]   They had people essentially take a fasting glucose test
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.360]   in different conditions.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.920]   I won't go into all the details,
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.380]   but here's what they found.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.920]   In healthy adults,
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.400]   even just one night of sleeping
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.880]   in a moderately lit environment,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.320]   this hundred lux environment,
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.600]   caused changes, increases in nighttime heart rate,
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.400]   which means that the sympathetic nervous system
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.080]   was overly active as compared to people that slept
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.860]   in a completely dark or in a very, very dimly lit room,
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:23.460]   decreases in heart rate variability.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.720]   And here I should point out that heart rate variability
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.420]   or HRV is a good thing.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:28.660]   We want heart rate variability.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.340]   So they saw increases in heart rate,
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:32.440]   decreases in heart rate variability,
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.320]   and increases in next morning insulin resistance,
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.740]   which is an indication that glucose management is suffering.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:43.280]   So this is powerful.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.840]   The results of this study essentially indicate
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.120]   that even just one night of sleeping the whole night through
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.460]   in a dimly lit environment is disrupting the way
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:54.920]   that our autonomic nervous system is functioning,
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.520]   altering so-called autonomic tone,
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.240]   making us less relaxed is probably the best way
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.480]   to describe it.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.080]   Even though we are asleep,
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.820]   disrupting the way that our cardio metabolic function
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.820]   operates such that we have lower heart rate variability
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:12.880]   and increased insulin resistance.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.640]   This is not a good thing for any of us to experience.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:18.240]   So while we've mainly been talking about the positive
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.160]   effects of UVB light and other forms of light.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.920]   Now we have two examples,
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.600]   one from the work of Hotar and colleagues showing
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.480]   that UVB exposure via the perihabenula can diminish
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.580]   the output of dopamine and other molecules that make us
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.840]   feel good if that UVB exposure is in the middle
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.760]   of the night or late evening.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.800]   And now we have yet another study performed in this case
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.160]   in humans indicating that even if we fall asleep
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.560]   and sleep the whole night through,
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.520]   if the room that we're sleeping in has too many locks,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.840]   too much light energy,
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.820]   that light energy is no doubt going through the eyelids,
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:55.600]   which it can activating the particular cells in the eye
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:59.160]   that trigger an increase in sympathetic nervous system
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:02.340]   activation and disrupting our metabolism.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:05.640]   And this study rests on a number of other recent studies
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.920]   published in Cell, which is a superb journal
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.180]   and other journals showing that during the course
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:13.040]   of a healthy deep night's sleep,
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.400]   our body actually transitions through various forms
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.760]   of metabolic function.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.400]   We actually experience ketosis like states.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.840]   We experience gluconeogenesis.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.640]   We experience different forms of metabolism associated
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.200]   with different stages of sleep.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.040]   Not something that we're going into in depth
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.760]   in this podcast, we will in a future podcast.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.840]   What this study shows is that light exposure,
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.060]   even in sleep is disrupting our autonomic,
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.360]   in this case, the sympathetic arm
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.380]   of the autonomic nervous system in ways
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:44.240]   that are disrupting metabolism probably in sleep,
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.240]   but certainly outside of sleep.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.400]   So that we wake up and have our first meal of the day,
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.680]   or even if you're intermittent fasting,
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.280]   you eat that first meal of the day.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.280]   If your sleep is taking place in an environment
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.560]   that's overly illuminated,
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:59.260]   well, that's disrupting your cardiac function
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:00.680]   and your metabolism.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.440]   I've been talking a lot about UVB light,
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.940]   which is short wavelength light.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:07.140]   So UV light, blue light, maybe even some blue green light.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.660]   That's going to be short wavelength light.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.760]   Now I'd like to shift our attention
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.100]   to the other end of the spectrum,
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:12.320]   meaning the light spectrum,
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320]   to talk about red light and infrared light,
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.220]   which is long wavelength light.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:19.920]   Many so-called low-level light therapies,
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.960]   the acronym is LLLT, low-level light therapies,
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.560]   involve the use of red light and infrared light.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.080]   Sometimes low-level light therapies involve the use of UVB,
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.200]   but more often than not these days when we hear LLLT,
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.720]   low-level light therapy,
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.500]   it's referring to red light
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.980]   and near infrared light therapies.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:44.560]   Low-level light therapies have been shown to be effective
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.600]   for a huge number of biological phenomenon
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.380]   and medical treatments.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.900]   I can't summarize all of those now.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.740]   It would take me many, many hours.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.340]   It would be an effective episode for curing insomnia,
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:57.340]   but it wouldn't inform you properly
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.760]   about the use of light for your health.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.340]   Rather, I'd like to just emphasize
[01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.520]   some of the top contour of those studies
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.000]   and point out that, for instance,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.120]   low-level light therapy with infrared light
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.920]   has been shown to be effective for the treatment of acne
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.000]   and other sorts of skin lesions.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.160]   There've been some really nice studies actually
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.960]   where they use subjects as their own internal control.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.120]   So people, believe it or not,
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.620]   agreed to have half of their face illuminated
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:23.880]   with red light or near infrared light
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.000]   and the other half of their face serve as a control
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.300]   and to do that for several weeks at a time.
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.060]   And you can see pretty impressive reductions
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:35.180]   in skin lesions, reductions in scars from acne,
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.180]   and reduction in acne lesions themselves,
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.980]   meaning the accumulation of new acne cysts
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.200]   with low-level light therapy using red light
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.560]   and infrared light.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.240]   Sometimes, however, there is a resistance of that acne
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.580]   to the low-level light therapy,
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.740]   such that people will get an initial improvement
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.660]   and then it'll go away despite continuing the treatment.
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.220]   So you're probably asking, or at least you should be asking,
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.740]   how is it that shining red light on our skin
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:04.600]   can impact things like acne and wound healing, et cetera?
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.100]   Well, to understand that,
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.340]   we have to think back to the beginning of the episode
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.700]   where I described how long wavelength light,
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.060]   such as red light and near infrared light,
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.120]   which is even longer than red light,
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.140]   can pass through certain surfaces, including our skin.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.780]   So our skin has an epidermis, which is on the outside,
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.400]   and the dermis, which is in the deeper layers.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.100]   Red light and infrared light can pass down
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.020]   into the deeper layers of our skin
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.740]   where it can change the metabolic function
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.860]   of particular cells.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.600]   So let's just take acne as an example.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.900]   Within the dermis, the deep layers of our skin,
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:39.700]   we have what are called sebaceous glands
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:43.700]   that actually make the oil that is present in our skin.
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:46.700]   Those sebaceous glands are often nearby hair follicles.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:50.100]   So if you've ever had an infected hair follicle,
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.460]   that's not a coincidence
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:53.100]   that hair follicles tend to get infected.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:56.220]   Part of it is because there's actually a portal down
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.380]   and around the hair follicle,
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:00.500]   but the sebaceous gland is where the oil is created
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.740]   that is going to give rise to, for instance, acne lesions.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.900]   Also in the dermis, in the deep layers of the skin,
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:07.900]   are the melanocytes.
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:08.920]   They're not just in the epidermis,
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.780]   they're also in the deeper layers of the skin.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:14.740]   And you have the stem cells that give rise
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.820]   to additional skin cells.
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:19.180]   If the top layers of the epidermis are damaged,
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.260]   those stem cells can become activated.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.520]   And you also have the stem cells
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.340]   that give rise to hair follicles.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:29.620]   So by shining red light or near infrared light
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:31.580]   on a localized patch of skin,
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.940]   provided that red light is not of such high intensity
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:36.500]   that it burns the skin,
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.520]   but is of sufficient intensity
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:41.060]   that provides just a little bit of damage
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.820]   to the upper layers of the skin, the epidermis,
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.180]   and that it triggers certain biological pathways
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:49.500]   within the cells of the sebaceous gland
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.460]   and the stem cells within the hair cell niche
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.020]   and the stem cells in skin,
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:56.660]   what happens is the top layers of the skin
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:00.460]   are basically burned off by a very low level of burn
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.420]   and/or the cells in the deeper layer
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:03.900]   start to churn out new cells
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:07.380]   which go and rescue the lesion,
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:09.620]   essentially clear out the lesion
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:12.020]   and replace that lesion with healthy skin cells.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:17.420]   This does work in the context of wound healing,
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:19.020]   getting scars to disappear.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.980]   It also works to remove certain patches of pigmentation.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:24.840]   There are sometimes cases where people will get
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.580]   a red blotchiness due to certain skin conditions
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:31.340]   or some darker pigmentation that they want removed
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.560]   or that they need removed
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.020]   because it's a potential skin cancer threat.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.860]   Now, how is red light actually doing it
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.540]   within the cells of the sebaceous gland,
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.000]   the stem cells, et cetera?
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.180]   Well, long wavelength light
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.180]   can actually get deep into the skin.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.000]   I mentioned that before,
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.780]   but can also get into individual cells
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:51.700]   and can access the so-called organelles,
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.340]   which I described at the beginning of the episode.
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:55.800]   In particular, they can access the mitochondria,
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.500]   which are responsible for producing ATP.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:00.540]   Now, the simple way to think about this
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:05.540]   for sake of this discussion is that as cells age,
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.120]   and in particular in very metabolically active cells,
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.780]   they accumulate what are called ROSs,
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.980]   reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.780]   And as reactive oxygen species go up,
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.340]   ATP energy production in those cells tends to go down.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.400]   It's a general statement,
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.180]   but it's a general statement that in most cases is true.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:29.880]   There are some minor exceptions that don't concern us
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.340]   that have to do with cell types
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.540]   different than the ones that I'm talking about now.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:35.420]   So the way to think about this is that red light
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.980]   passes into the deeper layers of the skin,
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.940]   activates mitochondria, which increases ATP,
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:42.720]   and directly or indirectly
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.060]   reduces these reactive oxygen species.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:48.220]   These reactive oxygen species are not good.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.360]   We don't want them.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.340]   They cause cellar damage, cellar death,
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.820]   and for the most part,
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.660]   just inhibit the way that our cells work.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.560]   So if you've heard of red light
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.540]   or near infrared light therapies designed to heal skin
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:05.020]   or improve skin quality or remove lesions
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.860]   or get rid of scars or unwanted pigmentation,
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.020]   that is not pseudoscience.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.340]   That is not woo science.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.580]   That is grounded in the very biology
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:16.440]   of how light interacts with mitochondria
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.360]   and reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.540]   Some of you may also find it interesting to note
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.740]   that some of the cream-based treatments
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.600]   for acne, for instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A,
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.060]   is actually a derivative of vitamin A
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.720]   and the pathway involving retinoic acid and vitamin A,
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.900]   believe it or not, is very similar
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:38.520]   to the natural biological pathway
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.980]   by which photopigments in the eye convert light information
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:44.640]   into biological changes within those cells.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.380]   So the key point here is that light is activating
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.260]   particular pathways in cells
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:52.820]   that can either drive death of cells
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.700]   or can make those cells essentially younger
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:00.540]   by increasing ATP by way of improving mitochondrial function.
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:01.800]   And in recent years,
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.340]   there've been some just beautiful examples
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:07.700]   that exist not only in the realm of skin biology,
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:10.180]   but in the realm of neurobiology,
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.800]   whereby red light and near infrared light
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.620]   can actually be used to enhance the function of the cells
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.780]   that, for instance, allow us to see better
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.600]   and indeed cells that allow us to think better.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.320]   So now I'd like to review those data
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.660]   because not only are they interesting in their own right,
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.500]   but they also point to some very interesting
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.900]   and powerful application of low cost or zero cost tools
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:34.460]   that we can use to improve our vision.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.020]   If you are somebody who's interested in the use of red light
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:40.060]   or near infrared light, so-called LLLT,
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:43.640]   low level light therapies for treatment of dermatologic
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.920]   issues, so anything related to skin,
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.160]   I will include a link to a excellent set of reviews.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.240]   The first one is light emitting diodes in dermatology,
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:55.220]   a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.480]   That one includes review of a very large number of studies
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:00.840]   came out just a few years ago in 2018,
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.900]   and I think is very clearly and cleanly laid out
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.220]   for anyone to access.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.120]   You can see the degree of effects of red light,
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.360]   for instance, on treatment of acne or scarring, et cetera.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.040]   And I'll also provide a link to another review,
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.320]   which is low level light therapy in skin,
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.080]   stimulating healing and restoring.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.760]   So for those of you that are interested,
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.260]   again, in dermatologic issues and the kind of restoring
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:25.200]   youthfulness and the kind of general themes of anti-aging
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.880]   and longevity and how red light therapies can be used
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:30.280]   for that, I will encourage you to take a look
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.360]   at those reviews.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.240]   What you're going to find is that rarely, if ever,
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:38.840]   is there a study looking at whole body red light illumination
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:41.880]   for sake of treating and improving skin.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.320]   And I mentioned this because I get a lot of questions
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.320]   about infrared sauna and global illumination with red lights.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.520]   We'll talk more about cases where global illumination
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.260]   of your whole body or your whole face with red lights
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.560]   might be useful.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.400]   But in terms of infrared sauna,
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.880]   I've mentioned on this podcast before,
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.400]   and I will certainly go deeper on this
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.400]   in an upcoming episode,
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.840]   all about the use of heat and temperature
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.940]   for augmenting our biology.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:11.840]   But in general, infrared saunas don't get hot enough
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.880]   temperature wise in order to trigger some
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.760]   of the important effects on growth hormone
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.760]   and heat shock proteins and some of the other things
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.960]   that sauna has been shown to be excellent for.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:22.900]   That's a general statement.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:24.520]   I realized there are some infrared saunas
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.400]   that do get hot enough.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.760]   There are very few data on the use of whole body illumination
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.580]   with infrared saunas.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.240]   They really point to any specific
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:37.380]   mechanistically supported effects.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.560]   Almost all the positive effects that you're going to see
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.860]   of red light and low level light therapies,
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:43.320]   certainly the ones discussed in the reviews
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.800]   that I just mentioned are going to be the consequence
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.700]   of very directed illumination of particular patches of skin
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:52.140]   that are seeking repair,
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:54.240]   that people are seeking the repair of.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.020]   So again, I don't want to disparage infrared saunas,
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:59.360]   but in general, they don't get hot enough
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.060]   to trigger most of the positive effects
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.860]   that sauna have been demonstrated to have.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:07.000]   And it's unclear at all as to whether or not
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.320]   they can enhance skin quality, youthfulness,
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.160]   restore top layers of skin that are damaged,
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.720]   repair acne, et cetera.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.080]   So more on heat saunas and infrared saunas
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.680]   in their comparison in an upcoming episode.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.560]   So let's talk about a clear set of examples
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.760]   where red light and near infrared light
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.360]   have been shown to have positive effects on our health.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.400]   And these are the data that I referred to
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.760]   at the beginning of the episode
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.020]   from Dr. Glenn Jeffrey at University College London,
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.600]   who again is a longstanding member
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:41.680]   of the neuroscience community
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.220]   working on visual neuroscience
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:45.400]   and who over the last decade or so
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.520]   has really emphasized the exploration of red light
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.520]   and near infrared light for restoration
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.980]   of neuronal function as we age.
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:55.200]   This is absolutely critical.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.400]   We know that we don't accumulate many new brain cells
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.240]   as we get older.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.220]   And in some areas of our nervous system,
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.000]   such as our neural retina,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.060]   which is the part of our eye that's responsible
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.480]   for translating light information to electrical signals
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.140]   so that we can see we don't get any new cells
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.980]   after the time in which we were born.
[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.560]   So the ability to keep our neurons healthy
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.400]   is extremely important for our visual system,
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.140]   extremely important for our hippocampus,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:24.260]   an area of the brain involved in memory.
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.980]   And I should just mention
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.040]   that even if people don't get Alzheimer's,
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.980]   there's always going to be some degree
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.860]   of age-related dementia.
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:35.660]   Sadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:36.960]   in the years before they die
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.200]   as they are 20 years before that.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.320]   It's just never the case.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.480]   We're all getting worse at thinking,
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.480]   feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:46.680]   The question is how quickly we are getting worse.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.560]   So any mechanism by which we can preserve
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.600]   or reverse neuronal function
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.360]   turns out to be immensely beneficial.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:58.960]   The Jeffrey Lab has published two studies in recent years
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.520]   on humans that looked directly, no pun intended,
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.800]   at how red light and near infrared light
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.300]   can improve visual function.
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.320]   I'm going to describe the parameters of those studies
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:13.220]   and then I'm going to describe what they found exactly.
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:17.600]   The mechanistic motivation for these studies,
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.480]   again, traces back to this effect of light on mitochondria.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.240]   So to go a little bit deeper into that mechanism
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.120]   just briefly so that you can frame any potential protocol
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.400]   that you would develop.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:35.600]   When light arrives on cells, including neurons,
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.600]   that light can penetrate into the cells
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.980]   if it's at the appropriate wavelength.
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:40.960]   Red light can do that, it can get into cells,
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.000]   it can access the mitochondria, it can increase ATP.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.840]   In general, anytime ATP is doing its thing
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:50.060]   to increase energy in cells,
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:54.440]   it's involving this thing called cytochrome C,
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.600]   which is an oxidase.
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.720]   Anytime you hear ACE, A-S-E in biology,
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.800]   it's going to be an enzyme.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.920]   It's involved in some process of degrading a molecule
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.200]   and creating another molecule typically.
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:08.440]   So ATP in cytochrome C is going to give you ATP.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:13.300]   Now that's a great thing, but it creates a by-product.
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.080]   It breaks things down such that you get these ROSs,
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.080]   these reactive oxygen species.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.860]   And those reactive oxygen species,
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:21.160]   for those of you that want to know,
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.860]   are involved in things like redox signaling
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:27.280]   and reactive oxygen species actually change
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.560]   which genes are made in a cell.
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.400]   So the goal of any treatment to keep neurons
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:35.860]   or other cells youthful and functioning well,
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:39.780]   and to prevent or reverse aging is going to be
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:44.140]   to increase ATP and to reduce reactive oxygen species.
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:48.480]   And in doing so, to disrupt some of the normal pathways
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.220]   associated with aging.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.040]   The Jeffrey lab approached these studies with that
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:57.160]   understanding of how mitochondria and reactive oxygen species
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.700]   and ATP work.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:02.060]   And what they did was exquisitely simple to the point
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:02.900]   of being elegant.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:05.240]   And what they found was really, really exciting.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.600]   What they did is they had people,
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.440]   subjects that were either younger,
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:14.000]   so in their twenties or 40 years old or older,
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000]   view red light of about 670 nanometers.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.520]   670 nanometers would appear red to you and me.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.640]   They had them do that, excuse me,
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.620]   at a distance that was safe for their eyes.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.720]   So at about a foot away.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.700]   Now, a foot away from a very intense red light
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.020]   could actually be damaging to the eyes.
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.200]   So they had them do this at about a foot away
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.960]   from a red light that was of low enough intensity
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.960]   that did not damage the eyes.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.980]   And they had them do that anywhere from two to three minutes
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:44.120]   per day.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:45.840]   And in one study, they had them do that
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.360]   for a long period of time of about 12 weeks.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.760]   And in the other study, they had them do that
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.680]   just for a couple of weeks.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.560]   What's remarkable is that when you collapse the results
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.080]   across these two studies,
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.660]   what they found is that when looking at these subjects
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:02.880]   ranging from 28 years old to about 72 years old,
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:07.880]   the major findings were that in individuals 40 years old
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.920]   or older, so in the 40 to 72 year old bracket,
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:16.600]   but not in the subjects younger than 40 years old,
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.120]   they saw an improvement in visual function.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.440]   That improvement in visual function was an improvement
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.440]   in visual acuity, meaning the ability to resolve,
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:28.840]   find detail, and using a particular measure
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:33.840]   of visual function, which is called the Tritan exam,
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:39.080]   T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan exam, which specifically addresses
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.360]   the function of the so-called short wavelength cones,
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.000]   the ones that respond to green and blue light.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.840]   They saw a 22% improvement in visual acuity,
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.240]   which in the landscape of visual testing
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.540]   is an extremely exciting result, okay?
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:59.220]   So I think in most studies of improvements of vision,
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:03.320]   you'd be very excited to see an improvement of 5% or 10%.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.520]   So a 22% improvement in visual acuity,
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.980]   even though it's in this very specific form
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:12.700]   of visual testing, this Tritan exam or this Tritan score,
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.000]   well, that turns out to be very significant
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.200]   and translates to the real world in an important way.
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.080]   In particular, as we age,
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:26.120]   we tend to lose certain neurons within our retina,
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.520]   but we don't tend to lose cones.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.160]   We tend to lose rods.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.280]   We tend to lose other cells within the retina,
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.240]   including the cells that connect the eye to the brain,
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.800]   the so-called ganglion cells.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:38.660]   Cones for whatever reason are pretty resilient
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:40.200]   to age-related loss.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.460]   However, because rods and cones both
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:47.720]   are not just among the most metabolically active cells
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.120]   in your entire body,
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.960]   but the most metabolically active cells in your entire body.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:56.200]   That's right, your rods and cones are the cells that demand
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.860]   and that use the most energy of all the cells in your body.
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:02.520]   Not your skin cells, not your spleen cells,
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.720]   not your stomach cells.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.920]   Even if you talk a lot,
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.120]   not the cells that are responsible for moving your mouth,
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.680]   it is the rods and cones of your neural retina
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.680]   that are responsible for using the most amount
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:15.640]   of ATP and energy in your entire body.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.080]   And because of that, those cells tend to accumulate
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:22.280]   a lot of reactive oxygen species as we age.
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.360]   Red light of the sort used in these studies
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.920]   was able to reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.360]   in the rods and cones,
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.200]   and to rescue the function of this particular cone type,
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.020]   the short wavelength and medium wavelength cones,
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:38.480]   which if you think about the study
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.200]   is a little bit surprising because it was red light
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:44.120]   and near infrared light, not short wavelength light
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:47.040]   that was used in order to create this improvement
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.560]   in cellular function.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.000]   But if you step back a little bit further,
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.760]   it makes perfect sense because there's nothing specific
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.940]   about the red light in the sense that it's not,
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.600]   that it gets delivered only to red cones.
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.400]   That red light and near infrared light is being absorbed
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.700]   by all the photoreceptors within the eye,
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:07.640]   the rods and the blue cones and the green cones
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.480]   and the red cones.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.760]   It's just that the red cones absorb that light best.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.340]   So the important takeaway here is that viewing red light
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:19.780]   and near infrared light at a distance at which it is safe
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.680]   for just a couple of minutes each day allowed a reversal
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:25.920]   of the aging process of these neurons,
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.640]   which some people have heard me say before,
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.320]   and I'll just say it again,
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.200]   the retina, including your photoreceptors
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:34.160]   are not just connected to your brain.
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:35.280]   They're not just near your brain.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.400]   They are actual central nervous system tissue.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:39.560]   They are the only two pieces of your brain.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.480]   Many of your neural retinas are the only two pieces
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.320]   of your brain that reside outside your skull
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.000]   or at least outside the cranial vault.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.280]   So here we're seeing a reversal of the aging process
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.560]   in neurons by shining red light on those neurons.
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.160]   Now, of course, the Jeffrey Lab is primarily interested
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.040]   in vision and humans are most dependent on vision
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.880]   as a sense to navigate the world and survive.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.240]   So this is really wonderful.
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.040]   Here we're looking at a therapy
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.560]   that can reverse age-related vision loss,
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.680]   at least in some individuals.
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:10.480]   But as you can imagine, the study was also done
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:13.080]   on these cells because they reside outside the skull
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.320]   and you can shine light directly on them, right?
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.980]   I'm sure that there are many people out there
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:19.440]   who are interested in how they can improve the function,
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.600]   say of the neurons in their brain responsible for memory.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.440]   And in a few minutes,
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:27.000]   I'll describe the non-invasive applications of light
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.060]   to try and restore the function of those cells as well.
[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:34.960]   So a little bit more about the studies from the Jeffrey Lab.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:38.860]   One of the things that they observed was a reduction
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.720]   in so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:46.720]   Drusen are little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.880]   that accumulate in the eye as we age.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.540]   We've all heard about cholesterol
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.080]   within our veins and arteries
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.660]   and how that can clog our veins and arteries
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.720]   and how, of course, clogging of veins and arteries
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:58:59.760]   is not a good thing.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.540]   Well, our neural retina being so metabolically active
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:06.140]   requires a lot of blood flow, it's heavily vascularized.
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:09.080]   And drusen are a special form of cholesterol
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.380]   that accumulate in the eye.
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:12.900]   As it turns out, these red light
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:15.020]   and near-infrared light therapies
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.480]   explored by the Jeffrey Lab
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:19.560]   were able to actually reduce or reverse
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:21.600]   some of the accumulation of drusen.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.620]   And so in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species,
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:27.980]   the idea in mind now is that red light
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:31.520]   may actually reduce cholesterol deposits
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:34.060]   and reactive oxygen species
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:36.520]   in order to improve neuronal function.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:38.740]   So what should you and I do with these results?
[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:40.220]   Or should we do anything with these results?
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.220]   Well, first of all, I want to emphasize
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.680]   that even though these studies are very exciting,
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.920]   they are fairly recent.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.960]   And so more data, as always, are needed.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.660]   There's some additional features of these studies
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.580]   that I think are also important to consider.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:55.780]   First of all, the exposure to red light
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.380]   needed to happen early in the day,
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.860]   at least within the first three hours of waking.
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:03.120]   How would one do that?
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:04.640]   Well, nowadays there are a number
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:06.600]   of different red light panels
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:08.880]   and different red light sources
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.740]   that certainly fall within the range of red light
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:14.260]   and near-infrared light that one could use.
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:17.120]   I don't have any affiliation to any companies
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:21.640]   or products that promote or make those red light therapies.
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.380]   I do own a red light panel.
[02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:25.920]   So I confess I have started using this protocol.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.800]   I am older than 40 years old.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:30.720]   I also have been experimenting with these red light panels
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.500]   as a way of addressing other changes in biological tissues
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.140]   for which I'm doing blood work, et cetera.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:39.480]   And I'm going to talk about that in a future episode,
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:41.560]   but that of course is what I call anecdotal data.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.180]   It only relates to my experience.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.360]   So today, and certainly on all episodes
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:47.700]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:50.700]   we emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.020]   talking about anecdotal data
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:54.820]   only when highlighting it as anecdotal data.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:58.540]   So if you're somebody who wants to explore red light therapy,
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:00:59.580]   here's what you need to do.
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:02.100]   You need to make sure that that red light source,
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.160]   whatever source you happen to use,
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.500]   whether or not you purchase it or make one.
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.260]   And in fact, these red light sources
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.860]   are very, very easy to make.
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.580]   You could essentially take a bright flashlight
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:14.100]   and cover it with a film or a filter
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.380]   that would only allow particular long wavelengths
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.220]   to pass through.
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:19.860]   This would be very easy to look up online
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:20.700]   and figure out how to do this.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:23.520]   You could probably do this for just a few dollars,
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.480]   or you could purchase a red light unit
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.440]   if that was within your budget
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.960]   and something that you're interested in.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.800]   You want to make sure that it's not so bright
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.580]   that you're damaging your eye.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.300]   A good rule of thumb is that something
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:35.880]   isn't painful to look at.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.360]   And in fact, I should just emphasize
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.520]   that anytime you look at any light source,
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:41.460]   sunlight or otherwise that's painful
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.000]   and makes you want to squint or close your eyes,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.860]   that means it's too bright to look at
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.980]   without closing your eyes.
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:47.380]   Okay, that's sort of a duh,
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:49.480]   but I would loathe to think that anyone
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.720]   would harm themselves with bright light in any way.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.940]   I don't just say that to protect us.
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:54.840]   I say that to protect you, of course,
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.700]   because you are responsible for your health.
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.260]   And again, retinal neurons do not regenerate.
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:02.140]   Once they are gone and dead, they do not come back.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:03.740]   There's no technology to replace them
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:06.240]   at this current state in time.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.360]   So please don't damage your retinas.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.820]   So is a red light source safe to look at
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.460]   if it is not painful to look at?
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:16.000]   Chances are it is, and yet I would still encourage you
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.180]   to talk to your optometrist or ophthalmologist
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:21.900]   before getting into any extensive protocols.
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:24.060]   But if you were still determined to pursue
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:26.260]   the sorts of protocols that are in the Jeffrey studies,
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.400]   certainly we'll provide a link to those studies.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:31.140]   Again, it involves looking at these red light panels,
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:36.140]   blinking aloud for two minutes to three minutes,
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.760]   every morning for a period of two weeks or more.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.820]   And if you're older than 40,
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:46.200]   that could very well have an effect.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.540]   If you're longer, younger than 40, excuse me,
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.700]   that's unlikely to have an effect.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:52.460]   At least that was what was observed
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.060]   in these particular studies.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.540]   The lights were not flashing.
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:57.220]   It was continuous illumination.
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:58.820]   Again, you're allowed to blink.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.820]   It does not have to even be direct illumination.
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.460]   It can be somewhat indirect illumination,
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:06.220]   much as we described for the use of UVB light before.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:08.180]   The wavelength of light is important.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.180]   It is red light and near-infrared light
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:14.020]   that is going to be effective in this scenario.
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:16.780]   The authors of this study emphasize that it was red light
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:20.220]   of 670 nanometers in wavelength
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:25.220]   and near-infrared light of 790 nanometers in wavelength.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:26.820]   That were effective.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:29.720]   And that those wavelengths could be complimentary.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.200]   That's probably why, or maybe it's just coincidental,
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.220]   but it's a fortunate coincidence
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:37.680]   that a lot of the commercially available red light panels
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.520]   that you'll find out there
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.500]   combine both red light and near-infrared light.
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:44.280]   However, I want to emphasize that most of the panels
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.940]   that are commercially available are going to be too bright
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.500]   to safely look at very close up.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:53.020]   And in fact, that's why most of those red light panels
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:54.980]   are designed for illumination of the skin
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:58.940]   and oftentimes arrive in their packaging with eye protectors
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:01.740]   that are actually designed to shield out all the red light.
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:06.220]   So take the potential dangers of excessive illumination
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:09.260]   of the eyes with any wavelength of light seriously.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:12.820]   But if you're going to explore 670 and 790 nanometer light
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:16.340]   for sake of enhancing neuronal function,
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.660]   set it at a distance that's comfortable to look at
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.340]   and that doesn't force you to squint
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.940]   or doesn't make you feel uncomfortable physically
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:26.280]   as if you need to turn away during the period
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.780]   of that two to three minute illumination each day.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:32.380]   In terms of turning away from light,
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:36.020]   I'll just briefly mention that that is not an accident
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:37.780]   or a coincidence that you have that response
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.980]   to very bright light.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:41.820]   There is a so-called photic avoidance pathway
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.660]   that involves cells within your retina,
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:45.260]   these ganglion cells that communicate
[02:04:45.260 --> 02:04:48.120]   with yet another brain station,
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.900]   a certain area of your thalamus
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.400]   that communicate to areas of your brain
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.580]   that are associated with pain.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:55.340]   So literally that can trigger headache
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:57.460]   and that can trigger the squint reflex.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:00.420]   Biology is just beautiful in this way.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:03.480]   Too much light is bad for us in that it can damage our eyes
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.160]   and other aspects of our body.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.380]   So if we look at a light that's too bright,
[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:08.980]   our eyes send a signal to the brain
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:10.360]   that gives us a sort of a headache
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.100]   and a desire to squint and turn away.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:14.040]   So that can be a useful guide
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.680]   in terms of gauging how bright a light should be
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:19.980]   or at least how far away you should be from a bright source
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:23.080]   in order to safely engage with that light source.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.880]   So the studies I just described, once again,
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:27.980]   involve the use of red light early in the day
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:29.400]   within three hours of waking
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.760]   and are for the sake of improving neuronal function.
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:35.760]   Red light has also been shown to be beneficial
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:38.160]   late in the day and even in the middle of the night.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.260]   And when I say middle of the night,
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:43.100]   I'm referring to studies that explore the use of red light
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:44.620]   for shift workers.
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.380]   I know that most people are not working
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.040]   in the middle of the night, at least I hope they're not,
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:50.440]   but some of you may do that from time to time.
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:51.920]   All-nighters for studying, I confess,
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.580]   I still pull all-nighters every once in a while
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:57.160]   to prepare things like podcasts and other deadlines.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:59.760]   Really try not to, happens less and less as I get older
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:01.640]   because I think I get more disciplined
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.960]   and or less good at pulling all-nighters.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:07.360]   But I realized that many people are doing shift work
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.760]   or they have to work certainly past 10 p.m.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.600]   or maybe they're taking care of young children
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:14.040]   in the middle of the night and they have to be up.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.400]   In that case, red light can actually be very beneficial.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.000]   And nowadays there are a lot of sources of red light
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.940]   available just as red light bulbs, you don't need a panel.
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:25.220]   So what I'm basically saying is that it can be beneficial
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:28.080]   to use red lights at night.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.160]   The study I'd like to emphasize in this context
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:31.880]   is entitled Red Light,
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:34.160]   a Novel Non-Pharmacological Intervention
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:36.800]   to Promote Alertness in Shift Workers.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.000]   So beautiful study.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.360]   They explored the use of different wavelengths of light.
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:45.260]   So blue light of 460 nanometers or red light
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:49.500]   or dim white light of different brightnesses, et cetera,
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:52.720]   and looked at things like melatonin.
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:55.160]   How much does light of a given color
[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.800]   and intensity suppress melatonin?
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.580]   They looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:00.320]   They looked at wakefulness.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.600]   How much or to what degree could a given color of light
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.220]   increase wakefulness at different hours of the day?
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.320]   The takeaway from this study is very clear.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.540]   If you need to be awake late at night
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:12.320]   for sake of shift work or studying
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:14.780]   or taking care of children, et cetera,
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:17.500]   red light is going to be your best choice
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.240]   because if the red light is sufficiently dim,
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.000]   it's not going to inhibit melatonin production
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.080]   and it's not going to increase cortisol at night.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.800]   Cortisol should be high early in the day
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:31.960]   or at least should be elevated
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.500]   relative to other times of day if you are healthy.
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.840]   A late shifted increase in cortisol, however,
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:39.020]   9 p.m. cortisol, 10 p.m. cortisol
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:42.120]   is well known to be associated with depression
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:44.480]   and other aspects of mental health
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.380]   which is a mental illness.
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:50.100]   So if you do need to be awake at night or even all night,
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:53.620]   red light is going to be the preferred light source.
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:55.380]   And in terms of how bright to make it,
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:59.000]   well, as dim as you can while still being able
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.840]   to perform the activities that you need to perform,
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:03.060]   that's going to be your best guide.
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:05.420]   I'll provide a link to this study as well.
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:08.100]   Again, it's a really important study
[02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:10.320]   because it emphasized that there are forms of light,
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.240]   red light provided it's dim,
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:15.400]   that can allow you to stimulate the alertness
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:19.080]   that light landing on the eyes can provide.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:20.200]   So it allows you to stay awake
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.520]   and to do whatever work that you need to do.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:26.040]   It does not seem to alter melatonin production.
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:26.860]   So that's good.
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:28.880]   It does not seem to alter levels
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.000]   or timing of cortisol production.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.680]   So yet another case where red light used correctly
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.800]   can be beneficial.
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:37.760]   Up until now, we've been talking about the effects
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.440]   of shining different wavelengths of light on the skin
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.640]   or on our eyes and the downstream health consequences
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:47.560]   of that illumination.
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.560]   However, one of the most important goals
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:52.000]   of science and medicine is to figure out
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.600]   how to change the health of our brain.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.240]   And of course our brain is contained within our skull
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.160]   and therefore we can't just shine light
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.440]   onto the outside of our head
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.000]   and expect it to change the activity of neurons
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000]   deep within the brain,
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.560]   unless those neurons are linked up with our eyes
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.580]   or with our skin.
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:13.520]   And as it turns out,
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.480]   even though there are a lot of brain areas
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.680]   that are connected through neural circuits
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.580]   and hormone circuits through our eye
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:22.240]   and believe it or not also to our skin,
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.140]   many brain areas are not.
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:27.800]   Brain areas such as the hippocampus,
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:30.220]   which is involved in learning and memory,
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:33.180]   brain areas such as our neocortex.
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:34.840]   Well, some areas of our neocortex,
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:38.400]   such as our visual cortex are indirectly linked to our eyes.
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:39.600]   So if we shine light on our eyes,
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.420]   we can change the activity of neurons in our neocortex,
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:46.520]   but there are other brain areas that are not directly
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.060]   or even indirectly connected to our visual system,
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:53.080]   not at least in any immediate way.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.040]   So that raises the question of how do you change
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:56.400]   the activity of neurons in the brain?
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.080]   Well, there's pharmacology.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.800]   You can take pills,
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:02.360]   you can inject drugs that will change the pharmacology
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.840]   of neurons and the way they operate in fire.
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:07.760]   Of course, antidepressants are one such instance.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.720]   Opioid drugs are another.
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:12.700]   There's a huge array of psychoactive compounds,
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:14.700]   meaning compounds that will change the levels
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:16.760]   of chemicals in your brain.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.640]   Some of those work.
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.700]   Many of them also carry side effects.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.540]   It's all rather indirect,
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.320]   meaning you have lots of different cells
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.300]   in different areas of your brain
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.640]   that utilize the same chemicals.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:29.060]   So a drug, for instance, to increase serotonin
[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:31.520]   for sake of improving depression
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.560]   will also often have the effect
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:38.080]   of reducing certain neurons output of serotonin
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.280]   in the hippocampus and cause changes in appetite
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.480]   or changes in libido and so on and so forth.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.260]   You could imagine using electrical stimulation,
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.420]   putting wires into the brain
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.520]   and stimulating specific brain areas
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:51.320]   in order to activate the neurons in those brain areas.
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.960]   And certainly that works and has been done experimentally
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:56.860]   and is done during neurosurgery exams, et cetera,
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:10:59.600]   but involves removing a piece of skull.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:01.320]   So that's not very practical.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.360]   In principle, light would be a wonderful way
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.460]   to modulate the activity of neurons deep within the brain.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.320]   But again, the skull is in the way.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.400]   Recent studies, however, have figured out ways
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.720]   that light can be delivered to the eyes
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:20.220]   to change global patterns of firing in the brain
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:22.640]   in ways that can be beneficial to the brain.
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:25.480]   And the work that I'm referring to now
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.560]   is mainly the work of Liwei Tsai at MIT,
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.120]   Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her colleagues.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.840]   And what they've discovered is that there's a particular
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:38.940]   pattern of brain activity called gamma activity.
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:42.080]   Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.200]   of electrical activity in the brain.
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:45.220]   So not wavelengths of light,
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:47.980]   but wavelengths of electrical activity in the brain
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:50.520]   that can be restorative for certain aspects
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.080]   of learning and memory and can actually help create
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:56.780]   molecular changes in neurons that lead to clearance
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:59.240]   of debris and even reductions
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:01.760]   in age-related cognitive decline.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.760]   So the way to think about brain waves and brain oscillations
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:09.280]   is that neurons are electrically active,
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.120]   that involves chemicals, et cetera.
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:15.200]   And they can be active in very slow, big wave forms.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.840]   So you can think of, you know, delta waves,
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:20.400]   meaning, so you can imagine a wave of electrical activity
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.200]   that comes along very infrequently.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.120]   So a given neuron fires and then some period of time later
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:29.680]   fires and then some period of time even later fires.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.520]   Or you can imagine that that same cell is very active,
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.340]   fires, fires, fires, fires, fires.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:36.000]   You can imagine if it's firing very often,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.400]   it's going to be short wavelength, right?
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.340]   Shorter gaps between firing,
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:43.560]   or if it's firing very seldom,
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.480]   you're going to think about that
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:47.280]   as longer wavelength firing.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.020]   Turns out that gamma waves are one pattern of firing
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:54.760]   that lead to downstream metabolic functions
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.340]   and biological functions that end up clearing away debris
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:00.200]   that's associated with aging in cells.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:03.280]   And that also lead to molecular changes
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:06.400]   that enhance the kind of youthfulness of neurons,
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.240]   so to speak.
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:12.400]   How do we induce gamma oscillations within the brain?
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:17.220]   Well, what Liwei, Tsai and colleagues have beautifully shown
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:22.040]   is that by delivering certain patterns of light flicker,
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.320]   so lights going on and off at a particular frequency,
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.480]   the brain as a whole starts to entrain,
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:30.860]   meaning it matches to those particular patterns
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.700]   of light flicker,
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:34.360]   even though many of the brain areas that do this
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.680]   are not directly within the visual system or visual pathway.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.040]   So the studies that I'm referred to are several,
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:43.920]   but the one that I'd like to highlight is entitled
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.780]   Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher Order Brain Regions
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:49.140]   and Offers Neuroprotection.
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:54.140]   What they essentially did was to expose subjects to 40 Hertz,
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:59.140]   which is a particular frequency of illumination to the eyes.
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:02.020]   So it's light goes on, light goes off, light goes on,
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:06.220]   light goes off at a frequency of 40 Hertz.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.620]   And when they did that,
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:10.360]   and they recorded the activity of neurons within the brain,
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.920]   not just within the visual areas of the brain,
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:14.840]   but within other areas as well,
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.820]   they observed increased gamma oscillations,
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:23.040]   meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:26.080]   started to match to the patterns of light
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:27.980]   that were delivered to the eyes.
[02:14:27.980 --> 02:14:29.720]   This is really exciting and very unique
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:31.620]   from the different types of phototherapies
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:33.200]   that we've been talking about up until now.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.080]   All the patterns of phototherapy
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:36.680]   that we've been talking about up until now
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.280]   involved constant illumination with a given wavelength.
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:44.280]   Here it is wavelength generating patterns of illumination,
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.600]   light on, light off, light on, light off
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:48.480]   at a particular frequency.
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.740]   So what they found, for instance,
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.200]   using this pattern of stimulation,
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.640]   and by the way, the stimulation was called GENUS,
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:56.160]   gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation.
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.000]   So G-E-N-U-S, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation,
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.560]   had a number of really interesting effects.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:04.920]   First of all, it reduced so-called amyloid plaques
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.680]   and phosphorylated tau.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:08.360]   Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:09.760]   are associated with Alzheimer's
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:12.840]   and normal age-related cognitive decline.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.600]   So this is incredible, right?
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.240]   A pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:21.360]   creates a pattern of neuronal firing,
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.120]   not just in the visual areas of the brain,
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.600]   but in other areas of the brain as well,
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:28.720]   that in turn trigger molecular pathways
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:32.000]   that reduce some of the markers
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.460]   and the cause of age-related cognitive decline
[02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:35.520]   in Alzheimer's.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:37.200]   And in parallel to that,
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.120]   they observed an upregulation
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:41.300]   of some of the biological pathways
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.500]   that lead to enhancement of neuronal function,
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.620]   maintenance of synapses,
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.480]   which are the connections between neurons
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:48.320]   and so on and so on.
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.820]   They have discovered and list out a huge number
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:52.400]   of these biological effects,
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:55.280]   both the reduction in bad things, so to speak,
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.080]   and the improvement in good biological pathways.
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.060]   And I find these studies so exciting
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:05.560]   because first of all, they're non-invasive, right?
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:07.520]   There's no drilling through the skull.
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.760]   They are very tractable in the experimental sense,
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:14.020]   meaning that you could imagine
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.920]   that if 40 hertz stimulation turns out
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:17.820]   to be the very best stimulation protocol
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:20.360]   to induce these gamma oscillations, well, great,
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:22.280]   but because it's non-invasive,
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:25.080]   it's fairly easy to explore 50 hertz stimulation,
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.480]   100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation,
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:30.540]   and to do that with different wavelengths of light.
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:31.780]   And so that's what's happening now.
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:33.600]   The PSI lab and other labs are really starting
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:36.680]   to explore the full range of variables
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:39.680]   that can impact oscillations within the brain
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:41.440]   and their downstream consequences.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:43.600]   So again, this is phototherapy,
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.400]   but phototherapy of a very different sort
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.840]   that we've been talking about up until now.
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:50.920]   It's phototherapy designed to trigger activation
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:53.360]   of biological pathways far away
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.240]   from the very tissue that's being illuminated.
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.300]   And it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:58.320]   that we were talking about earlier,
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:00.840]   where illumination of the skin with UVB light
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:03.120]   is setting off an enormous number of different cascades
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.680]   in different organs and tissues, including the spleen,
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.140]   the testes, the ovaries, and so on.
[02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:11.760]   So again, light has these powerful effects,
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:15.060]   both locally on the cells that the light is delivered to,
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:18.440]   but also systemically in terms of the cells
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:21.680]   that are changing their electrical and chemical outputs
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:24.720]   are modifying lots and lots of biological programs.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:27.920]   Is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet?
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:30.280]   Well, that sort of depends on how adventurous you are.
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:32.880]   Right now, these studies are being explored
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.500]   in the context of clinical trials
[02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:36.320]   in people with Alzheimer's dementia
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:39.360]   and other forms of neuronal degeneration.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.720]   Is it dangerous to look at?
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:44.080]   A 40 Hertz flickering light?
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.820]   Well, in general, the answer is going to be no.
[02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:49.960]   However, if you're prone to epilepsy, for instance,
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.240]   staring at a flickering light
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:55.180]   of a given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:57.680]   That might surprise some of you, but it shouldn't,
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.040]   because as this study illustrates,
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:03.100]   and as anyone who's ever been out at night to a club
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:04.520]   or something illustrates,
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.800]   when you look at a strobe light, for instance,
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:09.920]   your whole world of visual perception changes,
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:13.200]   but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music,
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:14.440]   at which you perceive conversation,
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:16.200]   at which you perceive the movement of your body
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.720]   actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.160]   in most cases, strobe,
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.800]   if we're using the sort of club dancing example,
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:28.080]   your brain is in training to its outside environment.
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:30.840]   So given the power of flickering lights
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:34.400]   to entrain brain rhythms, I think at this stage,
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.500]   it's probably too preliminary
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:38.760]   to really suggest a specific protocol,
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:41.400]   but I would definitely keep an eye out
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.700]   for these sorts of studies.
[02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:45.280]   They are coming out all the time.
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.920]   And I think in a very short period,
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:50.420]   we're going to see specific protocols
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:53.020]   that one could potentially use even at home.
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.920]   And of course, these are non-invasive protocols
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:58.700]   in order to place the brain into a particular state,
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:01.540]   not just for sake of offsetting neurodegeneration,
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:03.880]   but also for enhancing focus,
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:05.920]   for enhancing the transition into sleep
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:07.620]   and other brain states as well.
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:11.240]   Today, I covered what I would say is a lot of information.
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:13.000]   My goal was to give you an understanding
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.780]   of how light can be used to change the activities of cells,
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:21.420]   organelles within those cells, entire organs,
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.900]   and how that can happen locally and systemically.
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:28.520]   We talked about the power of light to impact our biology
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.360]   at the endocrine level, neuronal level,
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:33.460]   immune level, mood, et cetera,
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:36.640]   through both illumination of the eyes and the skin
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:38.700]   and other tissues as well.
[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:42.360]   I realized that even though this was a lot of information,
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:46.380]   there are many aspects of phototherapy that I did not cover.
[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:48.520]   I know there's a lot of interest nowadays, for instance,
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:52.160]   in the use of red light and other wavelength light therapies
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:55.420]   for ovarian health and testicular health.
[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:59.120]   In fact, I get a lot of questions such as,
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.200]   can red light be used to improve testosterone output?
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:04.420]   And if so, is that best accomplished
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:06.720]   by shining red light on the skin
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:09.500]   or directly on the gonads, on the testicles?
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:13.460]   I'm going to cover those data at a future time.
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:16.220]   Right now, the studies that have been done in rodents,
[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:19.140]   I don't think are easily enough translated to humans.
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:21.460]   And the studies that are happening in humans now
[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:24.520]   are exciting in the sense that they hold a lot of potential,
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.540]   but the data aren't clear yet.
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:32.540]   However, the data using UVB on the skin of men and women
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:35.240]   in order to increase hormone,
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:37.220]   in particular testosterone and estrogen output,
[02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:40.220]   those data I think are very exciting and very actionable.
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:41.980]   And we talked about those earlier.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:43.860]   So if you want more information
[02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:45.600]   on how phototherapy can be used,
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.780]   certainly we will do another episode on phototherapy
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:50.620]   in these other contexts.

[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:38.180]   During today's podcast,
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:39.620]   we didn't really talk about supplements,
[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:42.540]   but we do talk about supplements and their various uses
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:45.500]   in many other episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:47.900]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:21:47.900 --> 02:21:50.340]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:53.820]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:56.480]   because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.860]   and stringency.
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:22:00.140]   If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:04.100]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:06.740]   And there you can get 20% off any of the supplements
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:07.580]   that I take.
[02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:10.680]   And if you happen to navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:13.660]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:16.380]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:17.460]   that Thorne makes.

[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.600]   It's also @hubermanlab on Twitter.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:27.180]   And at both places, I provide science
[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:28.140]   and science-based tools,
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:30.780]   some of which overlap with the content of this podcast,
[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.580]   much of which is unique from the content of this podcast.
[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:35.720]   If you're not already subscribing to our newsletter,
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:37.160]   you might consider doing so.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.240]   It's the so-called neural network newsletter.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:40.920]   You can find it at hubermanlab.com.
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:43.860]   Just go into the menu, look up neural network newsletter.
[02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:45.060]   You provide us your email.
[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:46.020]   It is zero cost.
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:48.120]   We provide summaries of podcasts,
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.540]   summaries of actionable protocols and so forth.
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.880]   We do not share your email with anybody else.
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:55.780]   And we have a very clear privacy policy there
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:58.300]   at that website if you choose to explore it.
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:22:59.380]   I'm also pleased to announce
[02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:01.260]   that we have some live events coming up.
[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:04.260]   So I will be giving a lecture called the brain body contract
[02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:06.420]   where I'll talk about science and science-based tools,
[02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.060]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:09.220]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:10.300]   much of which is unique
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:12.940]   and has never been presented publicly before.
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:16.060]   The first one is going to be May 17th, 2022
[02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:17.300]   in Seattle, Washington.
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:21.460]   The second one is going to be May 18th in Portland, Oregon.
[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:23.500]   To access tickets, you can go to the link
[02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:26.360]   at Hubermanlab.com/tour.
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.440]   So thank you once again for joining me today
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:31.640]   for this deep dive discussion into phototherapies,
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:32.820]   meaning the power of light
[02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:34.860]   to modulate our biology and health.
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:37.960]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:40.540]   (upbeat music)
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:43.120]   (upbeat music)
