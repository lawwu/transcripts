[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.160]   The glory of Babylon endures.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   Down through the ages, its reputation comes to us
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.900]   as the richest of cities, its treasures as fabulous.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.800]   Yet, it was not always so.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.980]   The riches of Babylon were the results
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.940]   of the wisdom of its people.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.380]   They first had to learn how to become wealthy.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.280]   When the good king, Sargon, returned to Babylon
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.020]   after defeating his enemies, the Elamites,
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.120]   he was confronted with a serious situation.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.760]   The royal chancellor explained it to the king thus,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.860]   "After many years of great prosperity brought to our people
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.000]   because your majesty built the great irrigation canals
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and the mighty temples of the gods,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.640]   now that these works are completed,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.800]   the people seem unable to support themselves.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.300]   The laborers are without employment.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.480]   The merchants have few customers.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.740]   The farmers are unable to sell their produce.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280]   The people have not enough gold to buy food."
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.680]   "But where has all the gold gone
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.760]   that we spent for these great improvements?"
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.380]   demanded the king.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.300]   "It has found its way, I fear," responded the chancellor,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.760]   "into the possession of a few very rich men of our city.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.500]   It filtered through the fingers of most of our people
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.740]   as quickly as the goat's milk goes through the strainer.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.040]   Now that the stream of gold has ceased to flow,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.080]   most of our people have nothing to show for their earnings."
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.480]   The king was thoughtful for some time.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.720]   Then he asked,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.360]   "Why should so few men be able to acquire all the gold?"
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.260]   "Because they know how," replied the chancellor.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.500]   "One may not condemn a man for succeeding
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.240]   because he knows how.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.540]   Neither may one with justice take away from a man
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.540]   what he has fairly earned to give to men of less ability."
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.700]   "But why," demanded the king,
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.860]   "should not all the people learn how to accumulate gold
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.100]   and therefore become themselves rich and prosperous?"
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   "Quite possible, your excellency.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.580]   But who can teach them?
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220]   Certainly not the priests
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.040]   because they know not of money-making."
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.600]   "Who knows best in all our city
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.280]   how to become wealthy, chancellor?" asked the king.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.860]   "That question answers itself, your majesty.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.960]   Who has amassed the greatest wealth in Babylon?"
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.040]   "Well said, my able chancellor.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   It is Arkad.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.160]   He is the richest man in Babylon.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.440]   Bring him before me on the morrow."
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.760]   Upon the following day, as the king had decreed,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.260]   Arkad appeared before him, straight and sprightly,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.120]   despite his three score years and 10.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.960]   "Arkad," spoke the king,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.460]   "is it true thou art the richest man in Babylon?"
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.780]   "So it is reported, your majesty, and no man disputes it."
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.920]   "How becamest thou so wealthy?"
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.000]   "By taking advantage of opportunities available
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.500]   to all citizens of our good city."
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.640]   "Thou hadst nothing to start with?"
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.160]   "Only a great desire for wealth.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.760]   Besides this, nothing."
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.620]   "Arkad," continued the king,
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.160]   "our city is in a very unhappy state
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.960]   because a few men know how to acquire wealth
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.980]   and therefore monopolize it,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.360]   while the mass of our citizens lack the knowledge
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.760]   of how to keep any part of the gold they receive.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.820]   It is my desire that Babylon be the wealthiest city
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.840]   in the world.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.640]   Therefore, it must be a city of many wealthy men.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.880]   Therefore, we must teach all the people
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.820]   how to acquire riches.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.020]   Tell me, Arkad, is there any secret to acquiring wealth?
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.140]   Can it be taught?"
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.360]   "It is practical, your majesty.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.460]   That which one man knows can be taught to others."
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.680]   The king's eyes glowed.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.360]   "Arkad, thou speakest the words I wish to hear.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.800]   Wilt thou lend thyself to this great cause?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   Wilt thou teach thy knowledge to a school for teachers,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.280]   each of whom shall teach others
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.720]   until there are enough trained to teach these truths
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.980]   to every worthy subject in my domain?"
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.900]   Arkad bowed and said,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.040]   "I am thy humble servant to command.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.400]   Whatever knowledge I possess,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.480]   will I gladly give for the betterment of my fellow men
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.360]   and the glory of my king.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.160]   Let your good chancellor arrange for me a class of 100 men,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.800]   and I will teach to them those seven cures
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.820]   which did fatten my purse,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.280]   then which there was none leaner in all Babylon."
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.960]   A fortnight later, in compliance with the king's command,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.480]   the chosen hundred assembled in the great hall
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.800]   of the Temple of Learning,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   seated upon colorful rings in a semicircle.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.800]   Arkad sat beside a small tabaret,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.160]   upon which smoked a sacred lamp,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.720]   sending forth a strange and pleasing odor.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.640]   "Behold, the richest man in Babylon," whispered a student,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.280]   nudging his neighbor as Arkad arose.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.580]   "He is but a man, even as the rest of us."
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.580]   "As a dutiful subject of our great king," Arkad began,
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.120]   "I stand before you in his service,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.440]   because once I was a poor youth who did greatly desire gold,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.800]   and because I found knowledge that enabled me to acquire it,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.520]   he asks that I impart unto you my knowledge.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.680]   I started my fortune in the humblest way.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.880]   I had no advantage, not enjoyed as fully by you
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.160]   and every citizen in Babylon.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.680]   The first storehouse of my treasure was a well-worn purse.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.800]   I loathed its useless emptiness.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.460]   I desired that it be round and full,
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.880]   clinking with the sound of gold.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   Therefore, I sought every remedy for a lean purse.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.000]   I found seven.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.860]   To you who are assembled before me,
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.320]   shall I explain the seven cures for a lean purse,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.320]   which I do recommend to all men who desire much gold.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.080]   Each day for seven days,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.560]   will I explain to you one of the seven remedies.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.680]   Listen attentively to the knowledge that I will impart.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.360]   Debate it with me.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.400]   Discuss it among yourselves.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   Learn these lessons thoroughly,
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.280]   that ye may also plant in your own purse
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   the seed of wealth.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.720]   First, must each of you start wisely
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.800]   to build a fortune of his own.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.240]   Then wilt thou be competent,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.380]   and only then to teach these truths to others.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.020]   I shall teach to you in simple ways
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.120]   how to fatten your purses.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   This is the first step leading to the temple of wealth.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.200]   And no man may climb who cannot plant his feet firmly
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.480]   upon the first step.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.060]   We shall now consider the first cure.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.520]   The first cure.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.320]   Start thy purse to fattening.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   Arkad addressed a thoughtful man in the second row.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.760]   "My good friend, at what craft workest thou?"
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.200]   "I," replied the man,
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.280]   "am a scribe and carve records upon the clay tablets.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.480]   Even at such labor did I myself earn my first coppers.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.020]   Therefore thou hast the same opportunity
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.600]   to build a fortune."
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.740]   He spoke to a florid-faced man farther back.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.740]   "Pray, tell also what dost thou to earn thy bread?"
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.560]   "I," responded this man,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.960]   "am a meat butcher.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.760]   I do buy the goats the farmers raise and kill them,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.600]   and sell the meat to the housewives,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.660]   and the hides to the sandal makers.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.300]   Because thou dost also labor and earn,
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.780]   thou hast every advantage to succeed that I did possess.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.160]   In this way did Arkad proceed to find out
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.280]   how much each man labored to earn his living.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.700]   When he had done questioning them, he said,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.040]   "Now, my students,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.460]   ye can see that there are many trades and labors
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.920]   at which men may earn coins.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.360]   Each of the ways of earning is a stream of gold
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.480]   from which the worker doth divert by his labors,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   a portion to his own purse.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.400]   Therefore into the purse of each of you
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.520]   flows a stream of coins,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.220]   large or small, according to his ability.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.080]   Is it not so?"
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.340]   Thereupon they agreed that it was so.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.300]   Then, continued Arkad,
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.220]   if each of you desireth to build for himself a fortune,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.820]   is it not wise to start by utilizing that source of wealth
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.860]   which he already has established?
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.940]   To this they agreed.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.220]   Then Arkad turned to a humble man
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.860]   who had declared himself an egg merchant.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.920]   "If thou select one of thy baskets
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.960]   and put into it each morning 10 eggs
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.720]   and take out from it each evening nine eggs,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.480]   what will eventually happen?"
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.040]   "It will become in time overflowing."
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.360]   "Why?"
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.600]   "Because each day I put in one more egg than I take out."
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.520]   Arkad turned to the class with a smile.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.280]   "Does any man here have a lean purse?"
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.560]   First, they looked amused.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.920]   Then they laughed.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.180]   Lastly, they waved their purses in jest.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.020]   "All right," he continued.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.820]   "Now I shall tell thee the first remedy I learned
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.040]   to cure a lean purse.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.320]   Do exactly as I have suggested to the egg merchant.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.940]   For every 10 coins thou placest within thy purse,
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.540]   take out for use but nine.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.860]   Thy purse will start to fatten at once
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.780]   and its increasing weight will feel good in thy hand
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.340]   and bring satisfaction to thy soul.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.940]   Deride not what I say because of its simplicity.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.960]   Truth is always simple.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.860]   I told thee I would tell how I built my fortune.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.580]   This was my beginning.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.140]   I too carried a lean purse and cursed it
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.380]   because there was not within to satisfy my desires.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.940]   But when I began to take out from my purse
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.340]   but nine parts of 10 I put in,
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.020]   it began to fatten.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.320]   So will thine."
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.340]   "Now I tell thee a strange truth,
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.420]   the reason for which I know not.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.340]   When I ceased to pay out more than nine tenths
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.580]   of my earnings, I managed to get along just as well.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.620]   I was not shorter than before.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.900]   Also ere long did coins come to me more easily than before.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.020]   Surely it is a law of the gods that unto him who keepeth
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.660]   and spendeth not a certain part of all his earnings
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   shall gold come more easily.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   Likewise, him whose purse is empty does gold avoid.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.480]   Which desirest thou the most?
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.660]   Is it the gratification of thy desires of each day?
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.520]   A jewel, a bit of finery, better raiment, more food,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.780]   things quickly gone and forgotten?
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.100]   Or is it substantial belongings, gold, lands,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.240]   herds, merchandise, income bringing investments?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.320]   The coins thou takest from thy purse bring the first.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   The coins thou leavest within it will bring the latter.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.080]   This, my students, was the first cure I did discover
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.680]   from my lean purse.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   For each 10 coins I put in to spend but nine.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.240]   Debate this amongst yourselves.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.940]   If any man proves it untrue, tell me upon the morrow
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.040]   when we shall meet again."
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.280]   The second cure, control thy expenditures.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.980]   Some of your members, my students, have asked me this.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.180]   How can a man keep one tenth of all he earns in his purse
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.260]   when all the coins he earns are not enough
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.840]   for his necessary expenses?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.460]   So did Arquette address his students upon the second day.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.220]   "Yesterday, how many of thee carried lean purses?"
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.660]   "All of us," answered the class.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.960]   Yet thou do not all earn the same.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   Some earn much more than others.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.940]   Some have much larger families to support.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.220]   Yet all purses were equally lean.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.600]   Now, I will tell thee an unusual truth
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.260]   about men and sons of men.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.620]   It is this, that what each of us calls
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.700]   our necessary expenses will always grow
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.700]   to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.300]   Confuse not the necessary expenses with thy desires.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.700]   Each of you, together with your good families,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.140]   have more desires than your earnings can gratify.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.900]   Therefore are thy earnings spent to gratify these desires
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.020]   insofar as they will go.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.740]   Still thou retainest many ungratified desires.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.460]   All men are burdened with more desires than they can gratify.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.720]   Because of my wealth, thinkest thou I may gratify
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.180]   every desire?
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.780]   'Tis a false idea.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.600]   There are limits to my time.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.360]   There are limits to my strength.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.900]   There are limits to the distance I may travel.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.760]   There are limits to what I may eat.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   There are limits to the zest with which I may enjoy.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.420]   I say to you that just as weeds grow in a field
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.540]   wherever the farmer leaves space for their roots,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.340]   even so freely do desires grow in men
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.860]   whenever there is a possibility of their being gratified.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.900]   Thy desires are a multitude,
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.700]   and those that thou mayest gratify are but few.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.220]   Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of living.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.180]   Herein may be most often found certain accepted expenses
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.820]   that may wisely be reduced or eliminated.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.540]   Let thy motto be 100% of appreciated value
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.140]   demanded for each coin spent.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.940]   Therefore, engrave upon the clay each thing
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.460]   for which thou desireth to spend.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.700]   Select those that are necessary
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.300]   and others that are possible
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.940]   through the expenditure of 9/10 of thy income.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.360]   Cross out the rest and consider them but a part
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.460]   of that great multitude of desires
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.660]   that must go unsatisfied and regret them not.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.600]   Budget then thy necessary expenses.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.300]   Touch not the 1/10 that is fattening thy purse.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.660]   Let this be thy great desire that is being fulfilled.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.420]   Keep working with thy budget.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.380]   Keep adjusting it to help thee.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.340]   Make it thy first assistant
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.740]   in defending thy fattening purse.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.340]   Hereupon, one of the students,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.320]   wearing a robe of red and gold, arose and said,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.820]   "I am a free man.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.460]   I believe that it is my right
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.580]   to enjoy the good things of life.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.460]   Therefore, do I rebel against the slavery of a budget
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.100]   which determines just how much I may spend and for what.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.900]   I feel it would take much pleasure from my life
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.540]   and make me little more than a pack ass to carry a burden."
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.540]   To him, Arkad replied,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.860]   "Who, my friend, would determine thy budget?"
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.540]   "I would make it for myself,"
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.980]   responded the protesting one.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.860]   In that case, were a pack ass to budget his burden,
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.500]   would he include therein jewels and rugs
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.460]   and heavy bars of gold?
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.460]   Not so.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.440]   He would include hay and grain
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.180]   and a bag of water for the desert trail.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.500]   The purpose of a budget is to help thy purse to fatten.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.080]   It is to assist thee to have thy necessities
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.440]   and in so far as attainable, thy other desires.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.980]   It is to enable thee to realize thy most cherished desires
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.940]   by defending them from thy casual wishes.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.340]   Like a bright light in a dark cave,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.140]   thy budget shows up the leaks from thy purse
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.100]   and enables thee to stop them and control thy expenditures
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.500]   for definite and gratifying purposes.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.400]   This then is the second cure for a lean purse.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.980]   Budget thy expenses that thou mayest have coins
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.580]   to pay for thy necessities, to pay for thy enjoyments
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.980]   and to gratify thy worthwhile desires
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.340]   without spending more than nine tenths of thy earnings.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.100]   The third cure, make thy gold multiply.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.540]   Behold, thy lean purse is fattening.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.040]   Thou hast disciplined thyself to leave therein
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.940]   one tenth of all thou earnest.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.620]   Thou hast controlled thy expenditures
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.420]   to protect thy growing treasure.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.560]   Next, we will consider means to put thy treasure to labor
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.340]   and to increase.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.500]   Gold in a purse is gratifying to own
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.380]   and satisfyeth a miserly soul, but earns nothing.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.340]   The gold we may retain from our earnings is but the start.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.740]   The earnings it will make shall build our fortunes.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.140]   So spoke Arkad upon the third day to his class.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.300]   How therefore may we put our gold to work?
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.620]   My first investment was unfortunate for I lost all.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.300]   Its tale I will relate later.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.340]   My first profitable investment was a loan I made
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.100]   to a man named Agar, a shield maker.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.660]   Once each year did he buy large shipments of bronze
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.820]   brought from across the sea to use in his trade.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.740]   Lacking sufficient capital to pay the merchants,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.540]   he would borrow from those who had extra coins.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.620]   He was an honorable man.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.960]   His borrowing he would repay together with a liberal rental
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.220]   as he sold his shields.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.020]   Each time I loaned to him,
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.980]   I loaned back also the rental he had paid to me.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.120]   Therefore, not only did my capital increase,
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.340]   but its earnings likewise increased.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.860]   Most gratifying was it to have these sums
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.740]   returned to my purse.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.240]   I tell you my students,
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.760]   a man's wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.940]   It is the income he buildeth,
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.900]   the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.780]   and keepeth it always bulging.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.540]   That is what every man desireth.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.820]   That is what thou, each one of thee desireth,
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.900]   an income that continueth to come
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.620]   whether thou work or travel.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.620]   Great income I have acquired,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.800]   so great that I am called a very rich man.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.440]   My loans to Agar were my first training
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.180]   in profitable investment.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.800]   Gaining wisdom from this experience,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.700]   I extended my loans and investments as my capital increased.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.180]   From a few sources at first, from many sources later,
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.240]   flowed into my purse a golden stream of wealth
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.560]   available for such wise uses as I should decide.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.060]   Behold, from my humble earnings,
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   I had begotten a horde of golden slaves,
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.260]   each laboring and earning more gold.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.920]   As they labored for me, so their children also labored,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.560]   and their children's children,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.640]   until great was the income from their combined efforts.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.140]   Gold increaseth rapidly when making reasonable earnings
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.560]   as thou wilt see from the following.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.620]   A farmer, when his first son was born,
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.440]   took 10 pieces of silver to a moneylender
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   and asked him to keep it on rental for his son
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.080]   until he became 20 years of age.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.520]   This the moneylender did,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   and agreed the rental should be
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.400]   one fourth of its value each four years.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.660]   The farmer asked,
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.160]   because this sum he had set aside as belonging to his son,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.040]   that the rental be add to the principal.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.200]   When the boy had reached the age of 20 years,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.040]   the farmer again went to the moneylender
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.060]   to inquire about the silver.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.880]   The moneylender explained that because this sum
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.560]   had been increased by compound interest,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.800]   the original 10 pieces of silver
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.780]   had now grown to 30 and one half pieces.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.720]   The farmer was well pleased,
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.040]   and because the son did not need the coins,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.560]   he left them with the moneylender.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.100]   When the son became 50 years of age,
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.560]   the father, meantime having passed to the other world,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.200]   the moneylender paid the son in settlement
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.040]   167 pieces of silver.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.460]   Thus in 50 years had the investment multiplied itself
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.700]   at rental almost 17 times.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.560]   This then is the third cure for a lean purse,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.720]   to put each coin to laboring
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.200]   that it may reproduce its kind
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.860]   even as the flocks of the field
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.560]   and help bring to the income
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.880]   a stream of wealth that shall flow constantly
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.160]   into thy purse.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.500]   The fourth cure, guard thy treasures from loss.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.680]   Misfortune loves a shining mark.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.320]   Gold in a man's purse must be guarded with firmness
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.160]   else it be lost.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.800]   Thus it is wise that we must first secure small amounts
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.960]   and learn to protect them
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   before the gods entrust us with larger.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.320]   So spoke Arkad upon the fourth day to his class.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.280]   Every owner of gold is tempted by opportunities
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   whereby it would seem that he could make large sums
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.140]   by its investment in most plausible projects.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.880]   Often friends and relatives are eagerly entering
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.200]   such investment and urge him to follow.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.400]   The first sound principle of investment
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.640]   is security for thy principle.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.360]   Is it wise to be intrigued by larger earnings
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.300]   when thy principle may be lost?
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.480]   I say not.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.220]   The penalty of risk is probable loss.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.840]   Study carefully before parting with thy treasure
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.780]   each assurance that it may be safely reclaimed.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.840]   Be not misled by thine own romantic desires
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.360]   to make wealth rapidly.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.280]   Before thou loan it to any man
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.680]   assure thyself of his ability to repay
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.440]   and his reputation for doing so
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.560]   that thou mayest not unwittingly be making him a present
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.800]   of thy hard earned treasure.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.040]   Before thou entrust it as an investment in any field
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.700]   acquaint thyself with the dangers which may beset it.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.080]   My own first investment was a tragedy to me at the time.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.580]   The guarded savings of a year I did entrust
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.620]   to a brick maker named Asmur
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.020]   who was traveling over the far seas
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.980]   and entire agreed to buy for me
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.460]   the rare jewels of the Phoenicians.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.940]   These we would sell upon his return and divide the profits.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.260]   The Phoenicians were scoundrels
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.940]   and sold him bits of glass.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.660]   My treasure was lost.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.960]   Today my training would show to me at once
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.140]   the folly of entrusting a brick maker to buy jewels.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.940]   Therefore do I advise thee
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.440]   from the wisdom of my experiences.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.040]   Be not too confident of thine own wisdom
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.360]   in entrusting thy treasures
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.920]   to the possible pitfalls of investments.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.020]   Better by far to consult the wisdom of those experienced
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.920]   in handling money for profit.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.280]   Such advice is freely given for the asking
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.840]   and may readily possess a value equal than gold
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.440]   to the sum thou considerest investing.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.720]   In truth, such is its actual value
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.980]   if it save thee from loss.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.640]   This then is the fourth cure for a lean purse
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.120]   and of great importance if it prevent thy purse
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.940]   from being emptied once it has become well-filled.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.560]   Guard thy treasure from loss
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.220]   by investing only where thy principle is safe,
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.720]   where it may be reclaimed if desirable
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.380]   and where thou will not fail to collect a fair rental.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.280]   Consult with wise men.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.620]   Secure the advice of those experienced
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.600]   in the profitable handling of gold.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.680]   Let their wisdom protect thy treasure
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.620]   from unsafe investments.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.040]   The fifth cure,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.300]   make of thy dwelling a profitable investment.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.600]   If a man set at the side nine parts of his earnings
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.800]   upon which to live and enjoy life,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.960]   and if any part of this nine parts
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.200]   he can turn into a profitable investment
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.280]   without detriment to his wellbeing,
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.880]   then so much faster will his treasures grow.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.920]   So spake Arcad to his class at their fifth lesson.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.680]   All too many of our men of Babylon
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.120]   do raise their families in unseemly quarters.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.920]   They do pay to exacting landlords liberal rentals
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.120]   for rooms where their wives have not a spot
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.480]   to raise the blooms that gladden a woman's heart.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.900]   And their children have no place to play their games
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.400]   except in the unclean alleys.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.640]   No man's family can fully enjoy life
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.480]   unless they do have a plot of ground
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.800]   wherein children can play in the clean earth
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.480]   and where the wife may raise not only blossoms,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.760]   but good rich herbs to feed her family.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.880]   To a man's heart, it brings gladness
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.960]   to eat the figs from his own trees
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.360]   and the grapes of his own vines.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.520]   To own his own domicile
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.680]   and to have it a place he is proud to care for
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.440]   put his confidence in his heart
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.580]   and greater effort behind all his endeavors.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.640]   Therefore, do I recommend that every man
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.960]   own the roof that sheltereth him and his.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.680]   Nor is it beyond the ability of any well-intentioned man
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.120]   to own his home.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.680]   Hath not our great king so widely extended
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   the walls of Babylon that within them
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.440]   much land is now unused
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.580]   and may be purchased at sums most reasonable?
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.320]   Also, I say to you, my students,
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   that the moneylenders gladly consider the desires of men
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.880]   who seek homes and land for their families.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.480]   Readily may thou borrow to pay the brick maker
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.920]   and the builder for such commendable purposes
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.680]   if thou can show a reasonable portion of the necessary sum
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.280]   which thou thyself hath provided for the purpose.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.000]   Then when the house be built,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.880]   thou canst pay the moneylender with the same regularity
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.000]   as thou didst pay the landlord
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.360]   because each payment will reduce thy indebtedness
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.480]   to the moneylender.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.200]   A few years will satisfy his loan.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.000]   Then will thy heart be glad
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.800]   because thou wilt own in thy own right a valuable property
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.880]   and thy only cost will be the king's taxes.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.780]   Also, wilt thy good wife go more often to the river
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.420]   to wash thy robes that each time returning
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.000]   she may bring a goatskin of water
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.360]   to pour upon the growing things?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.340]   Thus come many blessings to the man
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.960]   who owneth his own house
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.600]   and greatly will it reduce his cost of living,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.120]   making available more of his earnings for pleasures
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.360]   and the gratification of his desires.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.640]   This then is the fifth cure for a lean purse.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.160]   Own thy own home.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   The sixth cure, ensure a future income.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.720]   The life of every man
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.900]   proceedeth from his childhood to his old age.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.880]   This is the path of life and no man may deviate from it
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.280]   unless the gods call him prematurely to the world beyond.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.560]   Therefore do I say that it behooves a man
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.680]   to make preparation for a suitable income
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.480]   in the days to come when he is no longer young
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   and to make preparations for his family
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.080]   should he be no longer with them
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.500]   to comfort and support them.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.560]   This lesson shall instruct thee in providing a full purse
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   when time has made thee less able to learn.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.300]   So Arkad addressed his class upon the sixth day.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.240]   The man who because of his understanding
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.480]   of the laws of wealth,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.320]   acquireth a growing surplus
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.560]   should give thought to those future days.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.640]   He should plan certain investments
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.440]   or provision that may endure safely for many years
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.600]   yet will be available when the time arrives
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.520]   which he has so wisely anticipated.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.040]   There are diverse ways by which a man may provide
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.760]   with safety for his future.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.240]   He may provide a hiding place
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.480]   and there bury a secret treasure.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   Yet no matter with what skill it be hidden,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.920]   it may nevertheless become the loot of thieves.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.760]   For this reason, I recommend not this plan.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.580]   A man may buy houses or lands for this purpose.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.020]   If wisely chosen as to their usefulness
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.420]   and value in the future,
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.920]   they are permanent in their value
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.240]   and their earnings or their sale
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.600]   will provide well for his purpose.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.320]   A man may loan a small sum to the money lender
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.960]   and increase it at regular periods.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.320]   The rental which the money lender adds to this
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.880]   will largely add to its increase.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.200]   I do know a sandal maker named Ansan
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.160]   who explained to me not long ago
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.680]   that each week for eight years,
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.460]   he had deposited with his money lender two pieces of silver.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.000]   The money lender had but recently given him an accounting
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.080]   over which he greatly rejoiced.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.920]   The total of his small deposits with their rental
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.800]   at the customary rate of one fourth their value
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.040]   for each four years had now become
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.960]   a thousand and 40 pieces of silver.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.400]   I did gladly encourage him further by demonstrating to him
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.200]   with my knowledge of the numbers that in 12 years more,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.160]   if he would keep his regular deposits
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.480]   of but two pieces of silver each week,
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.440]   the money lender would then owe him 4,000 pieces of silver,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.400]   a worthy competence for the rest of his life.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.540]   Surely when such a small payment made with regularity
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.760]   doth produce such profitable results,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.080]   no man can afford not to ensure a treasure for his old age
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.320]   and the protection of his family,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.600]   no matter how prosperous his business
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.760]   and his investments may be.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.560]   I would that I might say more about this.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.440]   In my mind rests a belief that someday,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   wise thinking men will devise a plan to ensure against death
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.840]   whereby many men pay in but a trifling sum regularly,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.920]   the aggregate making a handsome sum
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.160]   for the family of each member who passeth to the beyond.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.400]   This do I see as something desirable
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.560]   and which I could highly recommend.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.960]   But today it is not possible
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.480]   because it must reach beyond the life of any man
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.680]   or any partnership to operate.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.400]   It must be as stable as the King's throne.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.640]   Someday do I feel that such a plan shall come to pass
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.880]   and be a great blessing to many men
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.800]   because even the first small payment
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.700]   will make available a snug fortune
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.720]   for the family of a member should he pass on.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.160]   But because we live in our own day
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.240]   and not in the days which are to come,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.040]   must we take advantage of those means
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.480]   and ways of accomplishing our purposes.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.720]   Therefore do I recommend to all men
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.760]   that they by wise and well thought out methods
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.400]   do provide against a lean purse in their mature years.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.960]   For a lean purse to a man no longer able to earn
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.440]   or to a family without its head is a sore tragedy.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.620]   This then is the sixth cure for a lean purse.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.740]   Provide an advance for the needs of that growing age
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.880]   and the protection of thy family.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:35.960]   The seventh cure, increase thy ability to earn.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.380]   This day do I speak to thee my students
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.380]   of one of the most vital remedies for a lean purse.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.680]   Yet I will talk not of gold, but of yourselves,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.140]   of the men beneath the robes of many colors
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.760]   who do sit before me.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.580]   I will talk to you of those things within the minds
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.380]   and lives of men which do work for or against their success.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.580]   So did Arkad address his class upon the seventh day.
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.140]   Not long ago came to me a young man seeking to borrow.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.020]   When I questioned him the cause of his necessity,
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.380]   he complained that his earnings were insufficient
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.140]   to pay his expenses.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.420]   Thereupon I explained to him this being the case,
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.740]   he was a poor customer for the money lender
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.160]   as he possessed no surplus earning capacity
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.940]   to repay the loan.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.640]   What you need young man, I told him, is to earn more coins.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.020]   What does thou to increase that capacity to earn?
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.960]   All that I can do, he replied, six times within two moons
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.620]   have I approached my master to request my pay be increased,
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.300]   but without success.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.360]   No man can go oftener than that.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.940]   We may smile at his simplicity,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.440]   yet he did possess one of the vital requirements
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.060]   to increase his earnings.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.980]   Within him was a strong desire to earn more,
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.620]   a proper and commendable desire.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.860]   Preceding accomplishment must be desire.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.220]   Thy desires must be strong and definite.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.180]   General desires are but weak longings.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.360]   For a man to wish to be rich is of little purpose.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.380]   For a man to desire five pieces of gold is a tangible desire
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.540]   which he can press to fulfillment.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.420]   After he has backed his desire for five pieces of gold
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.900]   with strength of purpose to secure it,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.020]   next he can find similar ways to obtain 10 pieces
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.600]   and then 20 pieces and later a thousand pieces
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.060]   and behold, he has become wealthy.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.420]   In learning to secure his one definite small desire,
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.080]   he has trained himself to secure a larger one.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.660]   This is the process by which wealth is accumulated,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.580]   first in small sums, then in larger ones
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.380]   as a man learns and becomes more capable.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.440]   Desires must be simple and definite.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.040]   They defeat their own purpose should they be too many,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.220]   too confusing or beyond a man's training to accomplish.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.240]   As a man perfected himself in his calling,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.700]   even so doth his ability to earn increase.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.580]   In those days when I was a humble scribe carving
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.900]   upon the clay for a few coppers each day,
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.460]   I observed that other workers did more than I
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.900]   and were paid more.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.500]   Therefore did I determine that I would be exceeded by none
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.800]   nor did it take long for me to discover the reason
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.300]   for their greater success.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.860]   More interest in my work, more concentration upon my task,
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.180]   more persistence in my effort and behold,
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.500]   few men could carve more tablets in a day than I.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.520]   With reasonable promptness, my increased skill was rewarded
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.580]   nor was it necessary for me to go six times to my master
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.860]   to request recognition.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.820]   The more of wisdom we know, the more we may earn.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.140]   The man who seeks to learn more of his craft
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.920]   shall be richly rewarded.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.220]   If he is an artisan, he may seek to learn the methods
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.380]   and the tools of those most skillful in the same line.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.660]   If he laboreth at the law or at healing,
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.500]   he may consult and exchange knowledge
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.180]   with others of his calling.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.140]   If he be a merchant, he may continually seek better goods
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.740]   that can be purchased at lower prices.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.900]   Always do the affairs of man change and improve
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.100]   because keen minded men seek greater skill
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.700]   that they may better serve those
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.160]   upon whose patronage they depend.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.180]   Therefore, I urge all men to be in the front rank
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.420]   of progress and not to stand still
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.660]   lest they be left behind.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.180]   Many things come to make a man's life rich
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.180]   with gainful experiences.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.480]   Such things as the following a man must do
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.420]   if he respects himself.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.360]   He must pay his debts with all the promptness
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.580]   within his power, not purchasing that
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.700]   for which he is unable to pay.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.020]   He must take care of his family that they may think
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.660]   and speak well of him.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.660]   He must make a will of record that in case the gods
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.980]   call him proper and honorable division
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.260]   of his property may be accomplished.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.580]   He must have compassion upon those who are injured
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.980]   and smitten by misfortune and aid them
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.620]   within reasonable limits.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.600]   He must do deeds of thoughtfulness to those dear to him.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.060]   Thus the seventh and last remedy for a lean purse
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:08.060]   is to cultivate thy own powers, to study and become wiser,
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:13.020]   to become more skillful, to so act as to respect thyself.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.980]   Therefore shalt thou acquire confidence in thyself
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.180]   to achieve thy carefully considered desires.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.940]   These then are the seven cures for a lean purse,
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.700]   which out of the experience of a long and successful life,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.100]   I do urge for all men who desire wealth.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.720]   There is more gold in Babylon, my students,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.620]   than thou dreamest of.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.960]   There is abundance for all.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.220]   Go thou forth and practice these truths
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.700]   that thou mayest prosper and grow wealthy as is thy right.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.540]   Go thou forth and teach these truths
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.780]   that every honorable subject of his majesty
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.140]   may also share liberally in the ample wealth
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.180]   of our beloved city.
