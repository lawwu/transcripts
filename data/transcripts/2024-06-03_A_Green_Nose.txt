[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Who's your Realtor?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Seriously, who is your Realtor?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Lately, there's been a lot in the news about real estate and Realtors.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So let us help clear the air.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   California Realtors are Californians just like you,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   your neighbor, your best friend's brother,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and your kid's baseball coach.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And we all strive every day to be your trusted advisors
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   on the biggest financial decision of your life.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   No one cares more about helping Californians live the California Dream
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   than California Realtors.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Because we know California real estate is not easy.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   That's an understatement.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   But if you're a first-timer, we help you confidently get in the game.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And if you've been there, done that,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   we're there to help you get through what's new and different.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We tirelessly negotiate so you don't have to.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And we help you get past all the tough stuff and on to the good stuff.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Not because it's our job, but because it's your dream.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let's go to work.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   California Association of Realtors.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Lucia and Punchinello looked out the window of Eli's workshop.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Like other Wemmicks, they were wooden people.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   But unlike the other Wemmicks,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   they weren't standing in line in the village below.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   "Look at them all," Punchinello exclaimed.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   "I don't understand it," Lucia wondered.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "Why would anyone want to paint his nose green?"
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   "Because everyone else is," Eli responded without looking up from his workbench.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Punchinello didn't understand.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "What do you mean?"
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   "Everyone wants to look like everyone else.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   "Sometimes it's square hats.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   "Sometimes it's tall shoes.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   "Why, last year, the big thing was yellow ears.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   "Now it's green noses.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   "Everyone wants a green nose."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   "Does a green nose make them smarter?" Punchinello asked.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "No."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "Does a green nose make them stronger?"
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   "No."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "Does it make them faster?"
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   "No."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   "Then what does a green nose make them?"
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Eli looked up and smiled.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   "Greener."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But his smile left as he looked out the window at the long line of Wemmicks.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   They think they'll be happier if they look like everyone else.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "But I made them different on purpose.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   "Freckles, long noses, bright eyes, dark eyes.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   "These were my ideas.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   "Now they all want to look the same."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   "Not me," said Lucia.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   "I'm happy just the way you made me."
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   "Me too," agreed Punchinello.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   "I don't need a green nose to feel special."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Then he paused and looked at the village.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   "But I would like to see how a green nose looks up close.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   "Want to go?"
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Eli smiled as the two stood to leave.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   "Just remember, I made you different on purpose," he told them.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   From street level, the line looked even longer and the noses even greener.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Lucia and Punchinello worked their way to the front of the crowd
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and watched as one Wemmick after another stepped into the nose coloring store
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and came out painted.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   "It's the latest thing," barked a Wemmick on the sidewalk.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   "Don't be the only Wemmick with a plain nose."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   "Who is that?" asked Punchinello.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Lucia shrugged.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   "I don't know."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "Why, that's Mr. Willie with it," volunteered a Wemmick from behind them.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   "Does he run the nose painting store?" asked Punchinello.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   "More than that," the Wemmick explained.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   "Painted noses were his idea.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   "So were the square hats and the tall shoes and the yellow ears.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "New things are his thing.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   "He decides what is with it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "Isn't he the best?"
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Lucia and Punchinello took a good look at this tall Wemmick
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   with a deep voice, big smile, tall hat, and green bow tie
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   that matched his oh-so-great green nose.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Both were thinking the same question.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Lucia asked it, "Who made him the new thing picker?"
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   The Wemmick looked puzzled, like he'd never been asked that question.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   "Well, I don't know. He always has."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Then his eyes brightened.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   "Wait, look, here comes a new nose."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   "Ooooh," said the Wemmicks.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   "Ah," admired some of the others.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The just-painted Wemmick didn't stop to speak.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   He just kept his nose in the air and walked past.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   All the green-nosed Wemmicks did this.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   After all, how could your nose be seen if it wasn't in the air?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Walking around high-nosed, however, was risky.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Wemmicks walked into walls, doors, even each other.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Lucia and Punchinello had to be very careful.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   One Wemmick took up the whole street.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   "Step back! Step back!" he announced.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It was the mayor.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   "Make way, every Wemmick! My wife is coming in for a touch-up!"
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   With one hand, he waved back the citizens.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   With the other, he guided her through the crowd.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   "Horrible! Just horrible!" she cried,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   covering her nose with both hands.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "I chipped some paint when I bumped into a tree.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Now the real me is showing!
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Horrible! Just horrible!"
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   As the crowd passed, Lucia shook her head.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "Such a fuss over a green nose."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   "Yeah," agreed Punchinello.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   "You'll never catch me in the nose-coloring store."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "Aw, Punch, I was hoping you'd go."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Punchinello recognized the voice immediately.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   "Twiggy?" he turned, looked at the wide-eyed, sweet-smiling Wemmick.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   His ears began to turn red.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They always did when he saw her.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   He reached up and covered them.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   "Why don't you paint your nose, Punch? I painted mine.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Everyone else is painting theirs.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Besides, you'd look good in green."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Twiggy reached up and touched the tip of his nose.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "It is so cute!"
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   With that, she turned and walked away.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   "Bye-bye," she waved.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Punchinello moved one hand from his ear to his nose.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   He turned and looked at his reflection in the store window.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Lucia had to grab his hand to get his attention.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "Come on, Punchinello, let's go."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   As he walked past the store, he noticed Willie Withett
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   examining his nose in a handheld mirror.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Later at home, he did the same.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "I never noticed before, but my nose sure looks pale."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The next morning, Punchinello walked down the street
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   with his friends, Splint and Woody.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   "Are you really thinking about it?" Woody asked.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   "Sort of," Punchinello answered.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "They say the paint stings your nose," Woody volunteered.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   "And it stinks," Splint added.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   "The brush could get in your eyes," Woody continued.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   "And it only comes off with sandpaper," Splint nodded.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   "Shh," Punchinello put a finger to his lips
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and pointed at a large crowd of green-nosed Wemmicks
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   standing in the square.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   "Something's going on."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   The mayor was standing on a platform.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   His wife, nose freshly painted,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and Willie Withett were on either side of him.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   "Welcome, one and all, to the first meeting
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   of the Nosey Wemmicks Club," he announced.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Your glistening green sets you apart as a Withett Wemmick."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   As if on cue, Wemmicks began stroking their noses.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   "You are classy. You are keen.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You are awesome. You are green."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Proud of his poetry, the mayor smiled
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and the Wemmicks applauded.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "We owe it all to Willie Withett," he shouted over the noise.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   "The pioneer of the painted snout."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Everyone applauded even louder.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   "People love me because of you!" one shouted.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   "I have more friends!" cried another.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   "With a green nose, I am a better Wemmick!" exclaimed a third.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   The mayor hung a medal around the neck of Willie Withett.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   "You have changed the face of Wemmicksville.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We salute your brilliance.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Without you, we'd all look like..."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The mayor paused, looking for the right word.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Then he saw Punchinello and his friends.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Pointing in their direction, he declared with a scornful laugh,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   "Them!" Everyone else laughed too.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Punchinello and his two friends lowered their heads and covered their noses.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "Let's hear it for Willie Withett!" shouted the mayor.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   "The Wemmick who discovered the cure for the common nose!"
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   As the townspeople shouted and applauded,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Woody, Splint, and Punchinello quickly turned and walked away.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They didn't stop until they stood in front of the nose-colouring shop.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Within a matter of minutes, all three were painted and walking down Wemmick Lane.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   "Hey, Punchinello!" asked Splint, pushing his nose upward.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   "Am I doing it right?"
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Punchinello didn't look.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "I can't see you, Splint. If I turn, my nose won't be in the air."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   "This is tough work," Woody added.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   "Not only do you have to get painted, but you have to walk weird."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   "Yeah, but doesn't it feel great to be with it?"
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   "With it?" Punchinello asked.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And, for a few days, it did.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   They hung out with other green noses and made weekly visits to the nose-acurist for a nose polish.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   They bought nose gloves for cold days and nose-brellas for rainy ones.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   All three read Willie Withett's new book, Winner by a Nose.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Most of all, they enjoyed looking down their noses at the unpainted Wemmicks.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   One day, when they were feeling especially smug,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Splint said to Punchinello, "I just can't imagine who wouldn't have a green nose."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Punchinello agreed.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   "Anyone without a green nose is so—"
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   "So what?" a voice interrupted.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It was Lucia.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Punchinello was embarrassed.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   "I haven't seen you in a while," he said.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   "You haven't seen anyone in a long time," she replied.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   "Except yourself."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   He started to speak, but didn't.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   He was bothered by what she said.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And he was even more bothered by what he saw.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   He saw it the next morning as the three were walking into Wemmicksville.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Standing on the other side of the road was a Wemmick with a red nose.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   "He needs to get with it," they said to each other.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But then they saw another Wemmick also with a red nose, then a third and a fourth.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   By the time they were in the village, they were surrounded by red-nosed Wemmicks.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And those whose noses weren't red were in line to have them painted.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   "Step right up!" shouted Willie Withett from the steps of his store.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "Green noses are out and red noses are in."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   "But we just got our noses painted green," they told him.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "No problem," he replied.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   "Our red will cover the green. Step right up and get in style."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   The three friends looked at each other sadly.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   "We thought we were in style," Woody moaned.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "What could they do but stand in line and have their noses painted red?"
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   For a few days, they fit in.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Until one morning, they saw a blue-nosed Wemmick.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   "Oh, no," they said to each other. "Not again!"
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   So they changed colors.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   But it was only a short time until blue noses were out and pink noses were in.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Then pink was out and yellow was in. Then yellow was out and orange was in.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Soon, Punchinello and his buddies had so many layers of paint on their noses
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   that they couldn't remember what they really looked like.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   "This has to be the final color," they said the day they walked out with orange noses.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   But once again, they were wrong.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   "I'm so tired of this," Woody moaned when he saw a purple-painted Wemmick.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   "I wish my nose was common again."
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   The three sat on a rock and hung their heads.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "Me, too," agreed Punchinello. "I should have listened to Eli."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "You think he would help us? Why don't you ask him?"
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   All three turned at the sound of the familiar voice.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   "Lucia," they said. "He asks about you every day," she told them.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "Is he mad?" Punchinello wondered. "Sad, but not mad."
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Punchinello looked up toward Eli's house on the hill.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   "He told me to tell you to come," Lucia spoke again.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   "Could I take my friends?" "Of course."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   "Would you go with me?" "Certainly."
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And so the four began the long walk up the hill to Eli's house.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   When they reached the top of the hill, Eli stepped out of the workshop and began walking toward them.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   He met them in the yard. One by one, he examined their noses.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   "Been trying to fit in, eh?" Punchinello nodded.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   "Did you succeed?" "Not really.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Every time we got close, someone changed the rules."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   "That's the way it is."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   "And my neck hurt from sticking my nose in the air," Woody added.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   "You weren't built to walk that way."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   "We just want to be ourselves again," Splint said.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   "I'm glad to hear that. Can we?" they asked.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Of course you can," Eli replied.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   "I'll always help you be who I made you to be."
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Then he reached in his pocket and pulled out a piece of sandpaper.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   "But it's going to take some time."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And so Punchinello and his friends followed their maker into his workshop,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   where he spent the rest of the day removing the paint.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It hurt to be sanded, but it was worth it to be normal again.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Feel the pulse of the city. Feel the beat of the drum.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Feel the bass blow your hair.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   In Las Vegas, live music delivers much more than sound.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   It's where music comes alive.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   With artists like Megan Thee Stallion, Maroon 5, Carrie Underwood, Shania Twain,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Babyface, Lionel Richie, and many more.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Every show is a playground for your senses.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   See the full summer lineup at VisitLasVegas.com.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.580]   (upbeat music)
