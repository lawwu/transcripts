[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - So you talked about family.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.360]   I think that there are very few people in the world
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.640]   who would say one of my big goals
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.160]   is to do anything measured in billions, right?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.720]   You mentioned $10 billion of real estate.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.560]   Most of the people I know that really, really prioritize
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   crazy, audacious business goals
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.200]   don't often talk also about prioritizing
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   being a good partner and being a good parent
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.640]   and having listened to you talk a lot.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   It's something you do more than most.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.320]   How do you find that balance?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.400]   - I mean, so first of all, yeah, I got into real estate.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.960]   I got into financial freedom,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   the pursuit of financial independence.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.320]   And I know it's kind of a buzzword, right?
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.480]   But all I'm talking about is
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.560]   when I say financial independence,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.320]   the ability to do what you want, where you want,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.120]   when you want, how you want with whoever you want,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.440]   whomever you want, I don't know.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.880]   It's just that freedom, right?
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.440]   That comes with having money.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.280]   It's not, it was never about getting rich,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.440]   never about being a billionaire
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.360]   or anything like that, right?
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.680]   I wanted to pursue financial independence for one,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.600]   two reasons, two reasons.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120]   And I think both of these will resonate with you, right?
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   Number one, when I was growing up,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.840]   like my dad worked really hard,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080]   but he wasn't there much 'cause he worked all the time.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.560]   And so I rarely saw him.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.160]   And I said, when I am a father someday,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.200]   I want to be there for every ball game,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   every ballet recital, every field trip.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.520]   I want to be there with my kids.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.720]   I want to like be the best father I can possibly be.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   And I can't work 40, 50, 60 hours a week
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.440]   and have commuting to be able to do that.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.280]   So I started with that.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   And that was the one thing.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.560]   The second thing I said,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   I heard a quote once that said the world is a book
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520]   and those who don't travel read just a page.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.320]   Like the world is so amazing, right?
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   So big.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.200]   And there's so many things to see out there.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.560]   And I wanted to see as much of it as I can
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.520]   while we're here on this earth.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.680]   And I knew that again, being broke
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000]   and working 40, 50 hours a week
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.280]   and getting my two weeks paid vacation every year,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.160]   that wasn't gonna cut it.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   So combining those two things,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.440]   that's why I pursued real estate and business
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.560]   and wealth in general.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.880]   Now, fast forward a few years
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.320]   and I find myself sometimes just like,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   I mean, I've achieved it.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.240]   I could retire right now and just sit on a beach
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.520]   and do nothing, but I'd be bored out of my mind, right?
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.680]   I can only play Barbies and GI Joes
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.360]   for so many hours a day.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.880]   So there's this balance that you have to have.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.000]   And there is no, to quote Gary Keller in "The One Thing",
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   there is no such thing as work-life balance.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   It's work-life balancing.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's a constant influx of flow
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.080]   that you sometimes have to go farther one way
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.960]   and sometimes you have to go farther the other.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   And therefore I am constantly re-evaluating
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.840]   where I am on that spectrum of too much work
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.720]   and maybe too much family, right?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   'Cause as an entrepreneur too,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.800]   we get paid in the future for the work we do today.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.480]   We don't get paid today for the work we do today, right?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.040]   So we have to do the work now
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.480]   to get paid five years from now.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.120]   We got to plant the seeds today in order to harvest then.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.160]   But I also need to make sure that my kids
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.840]   are being brought up right and that they're connected with me
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.040]   and that we have that solid relationship.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680]   So I guess that's why I talk about it a lot
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.720]   because I'm very scared, is that the wrong word?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.000]   Maybe I'm very concerned that at the end of my life,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.800]   I will look back and say, why did I work so much?
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.480]   Like, why didn't I do the things
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.680]   that are most important in life?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   And the only way to know that is to continually evaluate it
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.960]   and to have the conversation with people.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.600]   So I love when this topic comes up
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   because it forces me to introspectively look at my life
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   and say, how am I doing right now?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.200]   Like, can I do better?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.320]   Can I get more balance?
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.400]   What about you?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.680]   - So it's interesting.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.280]   I used to be someone,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   well, I still am someone who really loves productivity,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.120]   like inbox zero, kind of everything.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.400]   But one thing that I recently picked up,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   so we have two daughters, two and three months.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.280]   So still, you know, the day-
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.120]   - You're in it.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960]   You're in it.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.600]   - I always wanted to like get to inbox zero,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.280]   but I've lately still prioritized, right?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   When I'm working, I'm working in the most efficient manner.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.160]   But when I get to the end of the day,
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.560]   and it's actually nice
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.520]   that sometimes kids just force this, right?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.480]   Like we have an au pair, she's done at 5.30.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   Like there's no real option.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.680]   Like you gotta be there at 5.30.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.800]   I just kind of like let it drop.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.240]   And I think I've spent so much time in my life
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.960]   feeling like, gosh, everything I do today is for the future.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   I need to get it all done.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   I need to get all done.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.600]   And then the next morning, I'm like,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.560]   that didn't really matter
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.800]   that I got everything done before I went to bed.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.480]   Now, there are times, you know, Tuesday night,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.680]   this show comes out on Wednesday mornings,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.520]   or maybe this bonus episode on a Friday.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.560]   Like there are times where it's like,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.520]   no, I do have to stay up
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.800]   'cause this thing comes out this time.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.640]   But for the most part, there are a lot of things
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.040]   that you feel a lot of pressure to do.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.640]   And I found that the more I've built the muscle
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.080]   of getting comfortable with not doing some things,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   whether it's a task at hand,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.080]   or it's just saying no to a meeting,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.120]   the more you get comfortable with it,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.280]   the more, one, it's easier.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.680]   And two, you realize it doesn't matter.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.920]   So I remember I got this email
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.480]   from a guy named James Bechara,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.440]   who has a podcast called Below the Line.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.560]   And I said, we'd connected in the past,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.440]   and it'd been a few years.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.800]   I reached back out to him and he said,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.240]   you know what, I don't really wanna do meetings
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.600]   'cause I'm trying to prioritize other things in my life,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.280]   but I'm really down with asynchronous communication.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.120]   So if you want, you could go and use a tool like Loom,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.960]   and you could record a conversation
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.880]   you wanna have part of it,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.280]   and then I'd be glad to get back to you.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.480]   And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.400]   So one, it really raised the bar.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.840]   Like, I'm not gonna go record a video to talk to him
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.000]   to just shoot the breeze.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   So like, he's basically filtering for,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   if you just wanna have a BS conversation and talk,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   that's gone.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   And at the time, I wanted to catch up with him
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.520]   'cause I was trying to start a podcast,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.480]   but I didn't really have my questions formulated.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.120]   And it actually forced me to wait
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.960]   and ask when the time was right.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.520]   And then I started using that,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.560]   and boy, it makes everything so much more efficient.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   And it's just helped me prioritize.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.840]   So someone says, hey, you've started companies,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.520]   can you help me figure out how to start a company
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.640]   in the space that you did?
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.480]   I say, great.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   If you wanna go to Loom
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.400]   and you wanna record some specific questions
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.520]   or write them out in an email,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.160]   I'm happy to answer those questions.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.240]   And if it eventually makes sense for us to chat,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.680]   I'm happy to, but there's a lot going on right now,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.720]   and I just have to let some things drop,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.480]   and it's nothing personal.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.720]   And learning to do that and getting comfortable doing that
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.240]   has made it so much more comfortable to go and say,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.080]   you know what?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.040]   Like this week, our au pair is out of town.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.080]   She's in Boston, New York, Chicago, having a blast.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.360]   And that means there's no childcare and two kids is a lot.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.600]   And so other than this interview,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.040]   I basically have no meetings all week,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.480]   and I'm okay with that.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   And I'm letting things drop
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.520]   because I've gotten comfortable with that skill.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.800]   That's been the biggest thing for me
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.280]   is that comfort with doing something
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   that in your grindy kind of 20s, early 30s time of life
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   just felt unfathomable.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.040]   It's like, I gotta get it done.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.480]   Letting it go is very cathartic.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.760]   - You know, that reminds me,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.600]   and I love that you say like,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.720]   you know, as soon as you gotta drop some stuff, right?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.480]   In the book, "The One Thing," I'll bring it up again,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.280]   Gary Keller, Jay Papasan, they have the book, "The One Thing,"
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.800]   and they tell the story or the metaphor in there
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.440]   that says that life is like juggling a bunch of balls, right?
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.600]   You're juggling family, health, your work, your career,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.920]   your financial life, you're balancing all those things.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.000]   And he says, some of those balls are rubber
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.480]   and some of them are glass, right?
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.400]   When you drop something at work, it'll bounce right back.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.800]   Like typically nothing's really that bad,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.360]   but there are glass balls in our life, right?
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   Our relationship with our spouse
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.360]   or significant other is a glass ball.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   And you can only drop that so many times before it shatters.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.600]   And so there's this constant, yeah.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.120]   I'm always thinking a lot of my life is going to get dropped.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.600]   A lot of things are gonna get dropped.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.720]   Let's make sure we drop the right things.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.840]   And that, I think in my life,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.080]   like that would be a great reputation to have
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.520]   and a great dying thought
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.360]   is I drop the right balls throughout my life.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.760]   - And it's funny 'cause I respected the email I got
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.520]   from James so much.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160]   You think you have this email that's like,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.440]   I've had a handful of people
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.720]   that I would put in the category of important people.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.560]   Their emails are like,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.960]   hey, I'm not checking email this summer.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.680]   And I'm like, damn, that person's like,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.840]   they've got it figured out.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.760]   I didn't write back and be like, that person's an asshole.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.240]   My reaction was like, this person is prioritizing their life
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.000]   in many cases, better than me.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.880]   And so I would just encourage people to realize
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   that most of people's reaction to your dropping the ball
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.400]   in a polite way might actually be kind of jealousy and envy
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.480]   more than frustration.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   - And I would even, to push it to another level,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.040]   if I could real quick, like another reason to do that
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.960]   by adding these bounds in your life,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720]   like things like, for example,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   like people might be surprised to hear this,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.840]   but like, I mean, I'm building a billion dollar brand.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.800]   I have a billion dollars of real estate.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.200]   We'll buy 10 billion.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.480]   That should make my company about a billion in profit
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.960]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.600]   Like that's, it's a legit like billion dollar
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.760]   profit business.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.480]   And I work at most five hours a week.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.320]   Like that's it.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.840]   Like I don't work a lot of hours at this.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.640]   I'm gonna launch a new business next year
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.960]   that I think is gonna be awesome.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   And I'm from day one, I have the requirement.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.920]   I do not work more than five hours a week at this.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.840]   And the cool thing is, is by having those boundaries,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.480]   I am forced to build a business that I am not within.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.120]   Like I am building it from the outside looking in.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.400]   I'm not building it from the inside up.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.640]   I'm not doing every single role.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.720]   I'm saying, no, that's the rules of this business,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.080]   of this game.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.600]   I'm gonna play within the rules.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.520]   And so many people don't realize that you get to make
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.600]   whatever rules you want.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.520]   This is your game.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.720]   Like your business is your game.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   Make it however you want.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.000]   So established rules, like I only work this much.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.120]   I don't work Fridays.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.800]   I take Wednesday and Thursday and Friday off.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   Like who cares, right?
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.080]   And then you will find a way to be successful.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   'Cause if you're listening to this podcast
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.800]   an hour in or whatever we're in,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.080]   like you're a legit person.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.320]   You're going to find a way to be massively successful
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.040]   within the bounds of, within the rules that you establish.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.280]   So establish them.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.920]   Don't just play what's given to you.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.040]   Define what you want to do, what sounds amazing.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.480]   And then just go after that.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.720]   If you haven't read the book from Strength to Strength
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.520]   from Arthur Brooks, I think you should.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.640]   I think you'd enjoy it.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.120]   I had him on the podcast and it's about finding a new form
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.960]   of happiness as you transition from a style of intelligence
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.040]   and work in your early life that isn't as compatible
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.200]   in the second half of life.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.160]   And second half is not like seventies.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.800]   It's like, you know, late thirties, forties kind of age.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.680]   We were like, I'm finding a new way to work
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.280]   that is more compatible with long-term happiness.
