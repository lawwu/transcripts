[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   In this sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, the Doctor is preaching on the text taken
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.440]   from the book of Acts, chapter 7, verses 17 to 20.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   We come back to this statement which we've been considering the two previous Sunday evenings.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.400]   And again I would remind you that it's essential that we should understand the setting in which
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.240]   these words were spoken if we rarely are to learn the lesson that they're meant to convey.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.840]   This statement is a part of the speech, or the address, that was delivered by Stephen,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.320]   the first Christian martyr, who was on trial for his life before the great court at Jerusalem,
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.080]   which was known as the Sanhedrin.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.940]   And he was on trial simply because he was a Christian, no other reason at all.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.480]   He was a Christian, a notable Christian, he'd been made a deacon, he was a man who was filled
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.360]   with the Spirit, he was performing certain functions in the life of the church, he was
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.200]   preaching, teaching, discussing these matters with others, and it was because of that that
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.840]   he'd been arrested and put on trial.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.640]   The charge brought against him is one of blasphemy.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.840]   The religious authorities in Jerusalem, the Jews, the Orthodox Jews of that time, they
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.480]   regarded this preaching of Christ as sheer blasphemy.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.520]   They said that Stephen and the others were speaking against the temple, speaking against
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.600]   the law, speaking against Moses.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.560]   But the real trouble was that they were preaching this Jesus.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.040]   They claimed that this Jesus had risen from the dead, that he was none other than the
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.720]   Son of God, that he was the Saviour of the world, that he indeed was the only Saviour.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   That was their claim, that he was therefore setting aside all the things which they'd
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.600]   always treasured and in which they had believed.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.920]   Now Stephen is on trial, I say, because of all this, and here he is delivering his defense.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.640]   The presiding high priest addresses him, as we are told in the first verse, saying, "Are
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   these things so?"
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.040]   And Stephen begins to answer.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.880]   And his answer consists of a review of some of the great and salient features in the life
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760]   story of the children of Israel.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.640]   You must have noticed, those of you who attend here regularly particularly, you must have
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.480]   noticed, as I read that 105th Psalm at the beginning, how that seems to be doing the
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080]   very thing that Stephen did here.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.800]   It's done in many other psalms, in several other psalms, in the same way.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.360]   This was a favorite method with Jewish apologists for the truth.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.000]   They recapitulated the whole history.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And they did that, of course, for a very definite reason.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.440]   That it was this history that to them was the proof of the truth which they were proclaiming.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560]   And Stephen is in this self-same position.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   Here he is addressing these great Jewish authorities, religious authorities, political authorities,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   and others.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.840]   They were all met together.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.800]   They differed from one another, but they all joined together against Christ.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   They still do that.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.960]   They've done that throughout the centuries.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.120]   Now what is Stephen doing?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.840]   Well, what he's really doing is this.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   He's got one big point.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.760]   But like a very clever speaker, he makes his one point in several different ways.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   Or if you like, uses several illustrations to get on the same point.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.600]   And the point he's making is this.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.120]   That these Jews, who glory so much in their own history, are denying the real glory of
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   that history.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   That they've really failed to understand it at all.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.080]   And that's why they're in trouble.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   Incidentally, he shows them that this has been the besetting sin of their people.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.200]   Throughout the centuries they've tended to do the same thing.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.680]   And he gives them examples and illustrations of that.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.120]   So that's his method.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.520]   He takes some of these big facts in the history, shows them their meaning and significance.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.000]   Shows that every one of them is pointing forward to this Jesus, to this Messiah, to this Savior.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.280]   They're against the one for whom all their ancestors have been looking forward throughout
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   the centuries.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   That's the great point of his entire argument.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.440]   But as we have seen, each one of his cases, in a very wonderful way, is a kind of epitome
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   of the gospel.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.560]   You see, Stephen's argument basically is this.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.600]   That it is the same God who acts in the Old Testament and the New.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.360]   His point is that there's nothing new in this preaching of Jesus.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.280]   This is the fulfillment of all that had gone before.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   And he shows how God has always acted in the same way.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.460]   That's the wonderful thing about the Bible.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.600]   It is to me one of the best proofs of the inspiration of the Bible.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.720]   That though these 66 books were written by different men at different times and in different
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.920]   circumstances, there is this great unity, this great action of God.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.440]   And God always acting in precisely the same way, on the same principles.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.400]   And that is the thing that we've seen coming out in these cases.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   The first was that of Abraham.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   We've dealt with it.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.320]   Then comes the case of Joseph, and we've also tried to deal with that.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.480]   And now we come to this third case, the case of Moses.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.120]   Obviously, the most important one.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   All the Jews revere the name and the memory of Moses.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.120]   He was their great lawgiver.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   He was the great leader.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.240]   There were other great men in the Old Testament, but Moses always held a unique position.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.440]   So Stephen very naturally takes up this case of Moses.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.760]   And he's going to use this in precisely the same way.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.520]   He's going to show how their forefathers rebelled against Moses, didn't understand him, did
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.240]   the very thing that they are doing with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.760]   But we are looking at all this now because, again, I'm anxious to show you through this
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:07.000]   story of Moses some of the salient features and the most essential features of the Christian
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.200]   gospel.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.600]   I'm trying to do in my little way the very thing that Stephen did.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.640]   I am addressing men and women who rejected this gospel.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.760]   The world in general, this country in general, is rejecting it tonight.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   Why is it doing so?
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.000]   Well, it's very helpful to understand that by considering the reasons why the members
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.960]   of the Sanhedrin rejected the gospel.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.440]   It's exactly the same.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.040]   The passing of the years makes not the slightest difference.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.960]   As Stephen is able to show that these people were simply repeating what their forefathers
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.400]   had done even 2,000 years before, and later than that, right up to the birth of Christ.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.440]   So we say the same thing has been happening during the last 2,000 years since the Son
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   of God came into this world.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.040]   Now, all we are doing so far is to deal with the introduction to the story of Moses as
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.280]   presented by Stephen as it's put in these verses 17 to 20 in this seventh chapter of
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.920]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.240]   Now, and we are doing it particularly in this way.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.080]   We are considering it especially in the light of the opposition of what likes to call itself
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.560]   humanism at the present time.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.600]   Because here it seems to me this whole question of humanism and its rejection of the gospel
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   is dealt with in a very remarkable manner in the mere introduction to the story of Moses.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   Now, you remember the characteristics of humanism are essentially these.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.040]   Man has made the measure of everything.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.920]   Man is at the center.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.440]   Man's mind is the measure of everything.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.360]   So the supernatural has to go out.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.120]   Man doesn't understand the supernatural.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.680]   That's got to be dismissed.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.120]   Religion he regards as just a human invention, satisfactory for the time, but proved to be
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.400]   no use because of our great knowledge in these latter days, and so on.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.440]   And above all, the belief that man can save himself.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.040]   All you need is to give men with this innate ability that he possesses, knowledge, information,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   and instruction.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.640]   And man can put himself in order.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.520]   He can put his world in order.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.240]   Man, why, there's nothing he can't do.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.840]   He's already conquered the force of gravity.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.120]   He can send a man up into outer space.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   He can split the atom.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.400]   Man, great man, how wonderful he is.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.200]   There's nothing which he cannot do.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.720]   Humanism, those are its characteristics.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   All right.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   We tried to show last Sunday night some of the essential fallacies of that.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.280]   The first we showed was this, that this isn't a theory, this isn't a religion, this is history.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.000]   History, this means recapitulating history, like the psalmist was doing, and as the psalmist
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   did so often.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   History, events, facts.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.480]   This isn't a man sitting down, concocting a theory, getting a good idea, and propounding
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   it.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Not at all.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   It's a series of events.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.280]   The thing about these Jews, and that is why the Greeks so tended to despise them, Greeks
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.840]   of course were great thinkers, great philosophers.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   These Jews were not.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.320]   These people were always talking about some facts, some history, and they seemed rude
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.360]   and unintelligent to the sophisticated Greek.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.400]   But this was their case.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.200]   They said the only explanation of our history is that God has done things to us and for
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.640]   us and amongst us.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.240]   History, we repeat the same thing, that Jesus Christ is a fact of history, the greatest
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.360]   fact of all history, and everything depends upon that.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.520]   If the history isn't true, we have no gospel.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.480]   You can't separate here the facts and the meaning and the explanation of the facts.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.080]   We have seen also that the real difficulty with the so-called humanist is that the poor
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.520]   man has never understood the nature of the problem confronting him.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.120]   He talks so easily about saving himself, but he can't save himself.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.280]   He's not saving himself.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.360]   But why does he ever imagine he can?
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   It's simply because his view of his own predicament is so superficial.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   He's never understood the depths and the power of sin and of evil, the malign forces
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.480]   unseen that are governing mankind, the only explanation of this century in which you and
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   I live.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.040]   You simply cannot explain it.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.800]   It's not surprising that even one of the philosophers of this century, who had been
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.000]   an agnostic, not to say an atheist, and ended his life, one understands as a Christian,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.400]   I'm referring to the notorious, famous Dr. Job, and he told us that what convinced him
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.120]   that he was wrong was what he saw in the Spanish Civil War.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.920]   He said there is something about life which doesn't get an explanation from my thinking.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.240]   He felt that evil is a power, it's an entity, there is something active here.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's not the absence of qualities, but a very living, powerful force.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.960]   That's the thing that set him thinking in a new way.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.880]   But the humanist, he doesn't realize that.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.360]   He doesn't see the depth of the problem.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.160]   He doesn't see his own helplessness, and so he's ignorant of what God has done, that
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.640]   God alone can save, and that God has already provided the means of salvation.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.240]   But we must go on, we don't leave it at that.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.440]   There is another element about all this which is brought out very clearly in this introduction,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.400]   and this is the thing I want to put before you this evening.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.760]   We are told here not only that God saves, but we are told the way in which he does so.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   Now this is the thing that is particularly objectionable to all who think along those
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   humanistic lines, the way in which God saves.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.800]   How does he do it?
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:18.160]   The answer quite simply is he does it in a supernatural and a miraculous manner.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.640]   Now I know that when I say that, I am saying the thing that is most hateful to the modern
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.760]   mind, the modern man so-called.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.160]   The supernatural, the miraculous, the divine.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.080]   This I say is dismissed, rejected, derided.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   Why?
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.840]   Well, in terms of scientific knowledge.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.280]   There is no supernatural.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.920]   There is nothing beyond man's understanding.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.080]   There is nothing beyond that which men can see and measure and handle and touch.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.160]   There is nothing else.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.880]   Everything has got to be put on the bench before man.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.160]   Man is supreme.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.080]   Man looks down upon everything.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.240]   And to ask men to look up and to recognize the power of the supernatural, which is regarded
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:14.880]   not only as nonsensical, but insulting, insulting to the human intelligence, especially insulting
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.740]   to the men with modern scientific knowledge.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.280]   So it is dismissed in those terms.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.320]   Any longer they say to ask a man to accept the category of the supernatural and the miraculous,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.680]   they'll explain it away in terms of science or in terms of psychology.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:39.440]   Just imagination, folklore, ignorant people always ready to invoke something unseen, something
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   beyond man.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.780]   But that's just a manifestation of the infancy of the human race, just a stage in the development
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.780]   of men.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.320]   And so it is entirely dismissed.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.400]   And they won't even consider a gospel which claims to be supernatural and miraculous.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.240]   Now, it's not surprising that a humanist should speak like that.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.560]   In a sense you expect him to.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.920]   But what is surprising and which, and what are less is tragic, is that the Christian
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.400]   church in her folly should be tending to speak in exactly the same way.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.080]   That the Christian church should be arguing like this.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.320]   If therefore you want to appeal to the modern men and the modern mind, if the church is
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:35.200]   to succeed in the modern age, well she's got to present a gospel, a message that is acceptable
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.320]   to the modern men, the humanists, the scientists, the thinkers.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.640]   So the church is ready to do away with the miraculous, do away with the supernatural.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.840]   I've often reminded you one of the most popular religious movements on the continent
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.000]   of Europe at the present time is that associated with the name of a man called Bultman.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.520]   And his teaching is what is called demythologizing of the gospel.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.240]   He says if you are to get the modern, intelligent, instructed, scientific men ever to believe
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:13.480]   this gospel, you've got to clear out all the supernatural and the miraculous.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.400]   The modern men cannot believe it, so you've got to get rid of it.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.240]   And it's all quite unessential.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.200]   It isn't a part of the message, it's just a bit of the fantasy and the folklore of the
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.400]   first century that's attached itself to a kernel of wonderful truth and teaching.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.080]   So get rid of it all.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   Hold on only to that which is vital and essential and the modern man is ready to believe it.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.400]   Now this I say is what is truly tragic and for the following two reasons.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:51.600]   First, that when the church does that, her message does not appeal to the humanist.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.040]   Something if it were not tragic that would be really funny about this.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.360]   The Christian church is prepared to trim, clip, change her gospel, modify it in order
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.280]   to make it suit the modern palate.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.040]   But when it does so, the modern man won't have it.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.600]   The modern man looks at the church and says, "Well now, of course, you're saying, you're
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.360]   beginning to say what we've always said.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.080]   You've come now to agree with us, you've been wrong all along.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.000]   The church has been wrong all down the centuries, but now you've come to say what we have already
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.440]   been saying."
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.620]   So there's no gospel.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.960]   You see, the humanist has enough intelligence to see that what is now being offered him
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.600]   is not the gospel at all, it's his own teaching.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.160]   It's his own idea.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.720]   Now I'm not imagining all this, I could give you authorities, I could quote authorities
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.040]   for this.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.340]   That is why I feel that some of the best criticisms that are being offered of the whole tendency
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.840]   of the modern church to reduce her gospel, the best criticisms of that that I know of
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.280]   at the present time are being made by men and women outside the church who are not Christian.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.000]   They're intelligent enough to see that this is but an abandonment of the gospel.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.800]   So let me come to the second reason, which is this.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.760]   This is, I say, tragic for this reason, that to deny the supernatural and the miraculous
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.960]   element in this message, in this gospel, is to deny what is most essential to it.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.720]   Indeed, I'll go further.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.920]   I am here to demonstrate to you this evening that if you take out the supernatural and
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.800]   the miraculous out of this message, you've nothing left.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.720]   Nothing that man can't provide for himself, and what man has many a time already provided
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   for himself.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:45.680]   If this gospel is not supernatural and miraculous, well then I say there is no hope whatsoever
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.040]   for any individual in the world tonight or for the world as a whole.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.320]   There is no hope at all.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.600]   There is no hope on the human level.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.100]   A gospel must by definition be supernatural.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.840]   It must be miraculous.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.760]   It must be divine.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.800]   And that is the most essential characteristic of this Christian gospel.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.860]   But as I say, unbelief stumbles at this.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.320]   But let me get rid of this point so that we needn't waste any further time with it.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.760]   To object to the miraculous and the supernatural, you know, is not the hallmark of modernity.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.360]   That's very old indeed.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:33.400]   On this court, the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, there were people called Sadducees.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.480]   They didn't believe in the miraculous.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.600]   They didn't believe in the supernatural.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.360]   They didn't believe in the resurrection as a fact and a possibility.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.080]   So don't imagine you're doing anything new.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.920]   You're simply being any old in the first century.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:53.720]   We are reminded by the Apostle Paul that the Greeks regarded this gospel as utter foolishness.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.860]   They were the humanists and the modern humanists are but pale imitations of those great Greeks
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:06.200]   of the end of the pre-Christian era and this first century with which we are dealing.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.320]   There's nothing new about all this.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.560]   Mankind has always objected to this element of the supernatural.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.320]   We read in Psalm 14, "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Atheism isn't new.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.760]   Denial of the supernatural and the miraculous is not new.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.920]   It's as old as human sin.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.640]   It is as old as men rebelling against God.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:39.600]   Well then, let's get rid of that and let me just make the assertion that the saving message
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   is this.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:47.640]   I use the words of the Apostle Paul, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   Why not?
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:55.920]   "For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.840]   I am here to preach the power of God.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.820]   I have no message apart from this.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:06.080]   If God hasn't intervened, if God isn't acting, if God isn't saving, I have no message.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.360]   I'd go out to the pulpit and never enter it again.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   My whole message is that God is acting.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   God is over all and it is God's way of salvation.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.400]   Now let me show it to you.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:25.020]   It's all here for us, even in this introduction, to the very introduction of the story of Mersus.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.680]   So I would put it to you in the form of three principles.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   Here's the first.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.760]   The powerful character of God's ways, or if you prefer it, the omnipotence of God.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:43.040]   Here, of course, is the great message of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.480]   How many men can read the Bible and not see this?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.880]   Passes my comprehension.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.960]   How many men can read the Bible and only see moral instruction, ethical teaching and things
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   of that?
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:02.080]   But as he reads it, feel the activity of God and the movement of God and God acting.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's here from beginning to end.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.240]   You see, the whole Bible starts like that.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.640]   In the beginning, God created.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:15.040]   The Spirit brooded over the deep, over the abyss.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   Spirit of God brooding.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.960]   You see, this is the very beginning.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.520]   It's the keynote of the message of the whole of the Bible.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.200]   And you go on reading it and you see this intervention of God, God coming in.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.640]   The story of the flood, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah and the destruction of those
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.880]   foul cities, so like London and other cities of today.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   God coming in and doing something in judgment.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   It's God all along.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   And then particularly as we think of this story of Mersus, the Red Sea, the great crisis
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.040]   in the history of these people, God willing we should be considering it on some future
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   Sunday evening.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   But here they are.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.800]   They've come out and there's the Red Sea in front of them.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.360]   "By a hera, bel zephon."
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.600]   These mountains, the hosts of Pharaoh, hemmed in at the end, finished.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   Not at all.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   God.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:18.960]   I'll never forget during the last war, that terrible Sunday after the surrender of France.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.840]   I'll never forget it as long as I live.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.040]   We all, some of us remember the time of crisis, the strain, what we all felt.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.480]   And I was led, I really believe, by the Spirit of God to preach on that Sunday morning on
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.280]   the 14th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:46.520]   That very incident which I've just quoted, that crisis, when the end seemed to have come.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.280]   And you know I had a feeling even as I was reading that 14th chapter of Exodus, that
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.880]   in a sense there was no need for me to preach.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   Everything had been said.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.920]   Moses with all his genius and ability falls on his face before God.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   He doesn't know what to do.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.480]   The end has come.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.600]   And God speaks to Moses and says, "Why last thou on thy face on the ground?
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.520]   Speak to the children of Israel that they go forth."
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   And they did so.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.560]   Now that is so typical of all this history.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:24.200]   Now here, this is put to us in this little paragraph we are considering in a most fascinating
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   manner.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.760]   Let me show it to you.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.200]   The supernatural action of God.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.920]   The proof of the fact that with God nothing is impossible.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.680]   That God is over all.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   And when he chooses to act and begins to act, nothing can stop him.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.800]   Now listen to this.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.880]   But when the time of the promise drew nigh which God had sworn to Abraham, the people
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.320]   grew and multiplied in Egypt till another king arose which knew not Joseph.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   You realize what that's saying?
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.440]   It is saying that when this time of the promise drew nigh, that the children of Israel, they
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:08.480]   are the people always, the children of Israel grew and multiplied in Egypt.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.160]   Why do you think Stephen Troubledon bothered to say that?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.560]   Ah, this is the interesting thing you see.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.360]   Now our authorized translation is not quite as good as it should be here.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.800]   I read, "But when the time of the promise drew nigh."
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.560]   Others have it translated, "But as the time of the promise drew nigh."
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   But you know, even that isn't good enough.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.440]   Now this isn't my own conjecture, my own theory.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.560]   You can find this if you turn up your lexicons.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.320]   The authorities were not particularly evangelical, said this kind of thing, simply in terms of
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   scholarship.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.800]   This is the true translation at this point.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   "In proportion as the time of the promise drew nigh."
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.680]   In proportion as.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.160]   You realize what that means?
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.920]   In proportion as the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.760]   people grew and multiplied.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.320]   In proportion as.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.800]   In other words, as God had appointed a time when he was going to deliver this people.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.080]   Very well, you're starting at a date that is there, removed if you like, by years and
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.160]   months from this date that is fixed by God.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.320]   Now this is what we are told here.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:33.760]   "As the number of days became less and less, the number of the children of Israel grew
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.840]   and multiplied.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.200]   In proportion as the time drew nearer and nearer and nearer, the children of Israel
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:47.760]   multiplied and developed and increased in an amazing manner in the land of Egypt."
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.240]   What's the significance of that?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.280]   Well, there's only one answer to that question.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   It was God who did that.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:03.720]   As the time was drawing nearer that God had decided and determined to act, he increased
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.600]   the number of the people.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.840]   Now the translation makes me say that, but you must have noticed how in a very interesting
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:19.200]   way in the 105th Psalm in verse 24, the inspired psalmist has already said exactly the same
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   thing.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   This is what I read.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.720]   I read in the 23rd verse of Psalm 105, "Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.200]   in the land of Ham."
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:37.280]   And then listen, "And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   enemies."
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   That's God.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.200]   You see, the whole of that Psalm, as you remember, was in praise of God and what he's done.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   "O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people."
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.960]   So then he rehearses the history.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   God acting.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:02.720]   He says, "He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies."
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.120]   In proportion as the time drew nearer, the people were greatly increased and multiplied
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   by God.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   What's this?
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.040]   This is a miracle.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.440]   This is a miraculous action.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   This isn't an accident.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   This isn't chance.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.520]   God, you see, has got power to give fruit of the womb.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.200]   God can make women barren.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.520]   God can enable women to bear children.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.400]   The Bible's full of that sort of thing.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   He shuts the womb of such and such a woman.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.960]   He then gives her power to bear.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.840]   Why the whole story of Isaac, the son of Abram and Sarah's proof of this.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.160]   Abram, age 99, Sarah over 90.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.520]   No child.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.120]   God can open the womb of a woman over 90 when he chooses to do so.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.800]   He can close the womb.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.200]   He can do anything he likes.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.320]   It's the all-powerful action of God.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.640]   As the time, in proportion as it drew nearer, he increased and multiplied.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   He worked a miracle.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.560]   The children of Israel became so powerful that they became a menace to Pharaoh and his
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   dynasty.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.000]   Now that's the first thing.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.760]   The second thing I notice here is this, that this other king arose which knew not Joseph.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.040]   And he the same did deal subtly with our kindred and evil and treated our fathers so that they
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.640]   cast out their young children to the end that they might not live.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.800]   What made this king behave like that?
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.760]   And you know the answer is still the same.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.080]   It was God who made him do it.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.320]   Let's go back again to Psalm 105 verse 25 this time.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:43.800]   He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.320]   It was God that did it.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.360]   God turned the heart of this king against his own people.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.440]   Now this is the claim of the Bible.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.280]   This is precisely the kind of thing that the Bible is so fond of teaching.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.760]   You know my friends, the hearts of kings are in the hands of God.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.080]   I have often said this to me.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.920]   One of the most extraordinary statements in the Bible is in the book of Esther.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   The book of Esther is a book that the learned authorities are always fond of telling us
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.680]   is in their opinion a very doubtful book.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.880]   It shouldn't be in the canon some of them say.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   Why not?
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.520]   Well they say, you know, the name of God is not mentioned in it.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.560]   And of course from the standpoint of mere words and linguistics they're quite right.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.880]   The name of God isn't in it.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.360]   But you know if you can read the book of Esther without seeing the action of God you're blind.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.720]   Listen to the first verse of the sixth chapter.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.880]   On that night, this was the night of crisis remember for Mordecai and for the whole of
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:52.040]   the Jews, on that night could not the king sleep.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.800]   And he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   the king.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.480]   And that was the turning point in the whole story.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.600]   It was the point at which Mordecai's character was vindicated and he obtained his liberty
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.320]   and all the children of Israel.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   But you see how it happened?
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.480]   Here's a king who can't sleep.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480]   What's the matter with him?
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   Is this just a case of insomnia?
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.840]   Has he been eating the wrong food or has he been having a worrying day?
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.160]   Not at all.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.880]   This is God.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.800]   God controls kings as he controls flies.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:28.880]   He controls the lice, the troubled Egyptians that we were reading about at the beginning.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   There is nothing that he doesn't control.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.480]   The hearts of kings are in his hands.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:40.120]   The very thoughts and intents of their imaginations are all known to him.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.160]   You remember how Daniel put it to a great king, a bit of a dictator called Belshazzar.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.520]   He told him, he said, look here you're desecrating the vessels of God's temple.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.680]   You don't know what you're doing.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:58.720]   The God in whose hand thy breath is and all thy ways.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.120]   That's God.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:07.920]   Everything, times, circumstances, the behavior of kings, there is no one, no potentate, no
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.000]   great men, no great dynasty, nothing.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.320]   It is all under God.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.120]   And as you read the Old Testament, you see God handling, manipulating, controlling men,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.760]   nations, everybody.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   All things are under his control.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.560]   And then of course the next fact we're confronted by is this, in which time Moses was born.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   In which time?
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.000]   You see this exact time.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.880]   This wasn't an accident again.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.280]   It was God's determination.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.920]   He knew the time, so he sees to it that these two people have this child who was called
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.280]   Moses just at the right moment.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.080]   You read the Bible, you'll see it happening, the appointed time, the fullness of time,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   God's own time.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.440]   Here it is, it's always here.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.200]   Now God acts, he determines these things.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.520]   And then we're even told this, that when this child was born that he was exceeding
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   fair.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.000]   Why do you think Stephen troubles with a little detail like that?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.080]   He's got to recapitulate a great mass of history.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.560]   Why does he pick out a detail like the fact that Moses was exceeding fair?
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.920]   Well because he knows that that wasn't an accident.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:28.360]   He knows that Moses was made exceeding fair by God for one reason only, and that was that
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   when the daughter of Pharaoh should come along and see this little abandoned child, she should
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.840]   have been so fascinated and charmed and intrigued and attracted by the beauty of this child.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.680]   She says, "I must, I must take this child as my own son.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.840]   He's so beautiful, what a wonderful child."
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.640]   He knew it would appeal to a woman, but that isn't accident, that's God.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:57.000]   God gave him this exceeding fairness in order that he might be adopted by Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.280]   And then of course, the obvious fact that Pharaoh's daughter came along walking that
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.120]   afternoon just at the right time.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.240]   This isn't accident, my dear friend, don't you see it?
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.480]   The whole point that Stephen is making is that it's God doing all this, and this is
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:21.720]   the great message that God manipulates facts, persons, history, everything to suit his own
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.760]   grand plan and purpose of redemption and of salvation.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:36.120]   But you see what it all presupposes is the omnipotence of God, the miraculous power of
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.560]   God, the supernatural power of God.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:48.640]   I'm not here to detract from the greatness and the wonder of scientific discoveries and
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.200]   the advance in medicine and many other things at the present time all honor to man.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.400]   But you know when you deal with facts like this, you're in a realm where men can do
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.080]   nothing, he's helpless.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.280]   But God, with God nothing shall be impossible.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.600]   And this is the very heart and center of the gospel message.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.760]   This is the one hope for mankind, it is that God has acted in a miraculous and a supernatural
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   manner.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760]   How has he done it?
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:24.360]   Well, you see it of course to perfection in the story concerning Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.720]   The tragedy with your humanists and so many in the church is that they don't start at
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.200]   the right point in his story, they start in the Sermon on the Mount, interested in Jesus
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   as the teacher.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.680]   They say we're in difficulties, we're in trouble and Jesus seemed to have had a wonderful
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.280]   ethic, wonderful moral instruction, so they start there.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.400]   But you see they miss the whole glory, they don't know who he is.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.960]   If only they went back to the beginning, oh don't start reading Matthew chapter 5, start
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.160]   at chapter 1, start at chapter 1 in the other gospels in the same way and get at the story
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.240]   and this is what you'll find.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   Look at his birth.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   What's this?
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:09.600]   Well, this is a miracle, this is something supernatural.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.000]   You remember the story, don't you?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.480]   Young girl, young woman called Mary, suddenly visited by an archangel.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.240]   She'd done nothing, she was just doing her work as usual, living her ordinary life.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.120]   Suddenly this archangel appears before her and says, "Hail, thou that art blessed amongst
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   women."
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.240]   And he proceeds to tell her that she's going to give birth to a son and he's going to be
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.520]   very wonderful.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   He tells her that this wonderful son that's going to be born to her is going to sit on
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.720]   the throne of David and that his reign shall be without end.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:57.360]   He shall be called great, he shall be called the son of the highest and God, the Lord God,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.840]   shall give him the throne of his father David.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:08.880]   He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   And Mary, we are told, said unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing that I know not
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   a man?"
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.120]   Mary looks at this archangel and says, "What are you talking about?
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.480]   You don't seem to realize that I'm a virgin.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   I'm not a married woman.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.800]   I have never known a man.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   This thing is impossible.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.840]   I can't have a child.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.760]   Certain factors are essential before a woman can give birth to a child.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.160]   They're not present in my case.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   This is nonsense.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   This is ridiculous.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.400]   What are you talking about?"
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.680]   You remember the answer?
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.440]   The angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.680]   of the highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.520]   For also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:09.640]   For with God nothing shall be impossible."
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.520]   The birth of the Son of God is a miracle.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.280]   It's a supernatural action.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   Oh, I know.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   The learned authorities, they don't understand this.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   It's part of the Genesis.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   Is this possible?
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   And they try to explain it.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   They try to reproduce it.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.560]   But they've been trying a long time and it all comes to nothing.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.520]   And it always will come to nothing.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.640]   This is God.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.760]   This is miracle.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.600]   This is not just an ordinary child.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.080]   This is God in the flesh.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.520]   There's only one thing to say about that babe.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.840]   It's what the apostle Paul said once when he used these words, "Great is the mystery
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   of godliness."
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.280]   You can't understand it.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.600]   It's impossible to understand it.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.160]   It's beyond men.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.280]   Human categories are inadequate.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.640]   Science doesn't understand this.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.880]   It's impertinence on its part even to try to.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.440]   This is God acting immediately, directly, miraculously.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.360]   There is no limit on God's activity.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.000]   He has chosen to act normally in an indirect manner through what are now called the laws
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   of nature.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.080]   But they're the laws of God in nature.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.880]   But when he chooses to do so, he can act.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.960]   Apart from the me doesn't break the laws.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.280]   He simply acts on a higher level, on a higher plane.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.640]   And that is what you mean by miracle.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:27.160]   That was why Matthew Arnold was guilty of such folly when he said that he thought he
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.040]   could disperse the whole question of miracles by saying, "Miracles cannot happen, therefore
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.240]   miracles haven't happened."
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.520]   But you see the fallacy.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.320]   Miracles can happen because God is.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.000]   And this is the basis of our salvation.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.920]   That God has sent his only son into the world in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.800]   born of a virgin without a human father.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.440]   The Holy Ghost conceives him in the womb of Mary.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   It's a miracle.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   I don't know.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.440]   I don't pretend to understand.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.680]   All I know is I can't explain this person in any other way.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.480]   This is a learned satisfactory.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.920]   He's man, he's God.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   He's God-man.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.640]   Two natures in one person.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:17.240]   Because with God nothing shall be impossible.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.200]   The God that multiplied the children of Israel and caused them to increase greatly just at
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.680]   this time when they were in the bondage and the captivity of Egypt can operate in the
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:35.520]   womb of Mary and produce this holy thing called Jesus of Nazareth who is the Son of God.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.560]   And as you go on and read about him, you'll read about his manifestation of his glory
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.960]   and of his power.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.840]   My dear friend, if I didn't believe this I wouldn't stand here.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   It would be mockery.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.440]   I'd simply be putting my own ideas to you and suggesting to you that you pull yourselves
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   together.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   You can't do it.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   I can't do it.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   You can't do it.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   And I'd be foolish.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   I'd be wasting my energy.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.520]   But I'm here to tell you what God can do, what his Son can do.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.000]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.960]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:12.760]   And so you see, we were able to sing that paradox just now which sounds so ridiculous
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.400]   to the natural man.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Listen to this sort of thing.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.520]   Hear him, ye deaf.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.160]   And see, asking a deaf man to hear.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Are you just fooling him?
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.440]   Are you just playing with him?
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.200]   Are you just increasing his misery?
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.320]   You stand and shout at a deaf man, listen, hear.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.520]   You know he can't do it, yes, but when I tell him that in the name of Christ, I know
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.920]   that there's power in my word that enables him to hear so that I can command the deaf
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   to hear.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.080]   Hear his praise, you dumb.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   Your loosened tongues employ.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   A dumb man can't speak.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.640]   What's the use of telling him to unloosen his tongue and to sing the praises of the
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   Son of God?
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   He can't do it.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.440]   Oh yes, he can, when he's commended in the name of Christ.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.520]   Hear him, ye deaf.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.200]   His praise, you dumb.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.640]   Your loosened tongues employ.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   You blind.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   Behold, your Saviour come.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   And leap, you lame, for joy.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   Sprinkle your feet.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   Leap like a heart.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   And they do it.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:18.520]   This is, you see, because this is a miraculous and a supernatural gospel.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.560]   We are not preaching the power of man.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.000]   We know that that's useless.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   That man fails.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.520]   Every man has failed.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.000]   We are preaching a divine person.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.960]   God the Son come in the flesh.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.400]   Look at him in the days of his flesh.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.240]   Isn't that the sort of thing he did?
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.080]   He could heal the lame.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.800]   He could make the blind see.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.880]   He could say, "Will the man with an impotent paralyzed arm stretch forth that hand?"
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.880]   And he stretched it forth immediately.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.160]   Here is one who could raise the dead.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.480]   He stands in the cemetery.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.560]   His friend Lazarus has been dead for four days.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   The sisters say it's no good.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   He's been dead four days and now stinketh.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520]   Decomposition.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   Hopeless.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   Nothing can be done.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   He just stood there and he said, "Lazarus, come forth."
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   And he came forth.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   That's gospel, my friends.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   This is God's action.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   This is the impossible happening.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.520]   This is supernatural.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   This is divine.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.520]   This is miraculous.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   This is the very essence of the gospel.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:33.200]   If this isn't true, the world is damned and doomed without a single hope.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.560]   But it doesn't because the gospel is true.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.480]   Here is one who can shout to the raging tornado, the tempest, and the raging billows of the
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   sea, "Peace.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   Be still."
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   And there was a great calm.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.480]   Oh, thank God.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   For a supernatural, a miraculous gospel.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   I wouldn't be in this pulpit but for this.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   There'd be no hope for anybody but for this.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   This is God's way of salvation, the power of God unto salvation.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   But you see, you not only see it in his birth and in his wonderful life, you see it, of
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   course, supremely in the wonder and the glory of his resurrection.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   Not only of the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law and Herodians
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   and everybody else, Roman authorities conspired against him and condemned him and put him
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   to death.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   He has died.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   They take down his body and they put it in a grave and roll a stone over the mouth of
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   it and seal it and guard it with soldiers.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   There he is, finished.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   He's not finished.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   He breaketh under the bends of death.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   He rose triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   If the resurrection isn't true, there is no gospel.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   There is no hope, no hope for anybody.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   If this isn't the power that can be stronger than death and hell and the grave, it's useless.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   But it is.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   Oh, death, where is thy sting?
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   Oh, grave, where is thy victory?
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law, but thanks be unto God
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   Now, now, he's conquered everything.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   He is more powerful even than death.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   The last enemy that shall be conquered is death and he's conquered it.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   The resurrection is the absolute proof of it.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   And then you see, you come to the wonderful day of Pentecost.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   And here again is something supernatural and miraculous and divine.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   Here is a body of men, simple, ordinary, unlettered and tutored men called apostles.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   These are the men who fled when he was on trial and just went away to save their own
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   lives, their own skin.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   These are the men who fumbled and were ignorant, stupid, couldn't understand his teaching,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   were not able to grasp when he talked about his death.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   Here they are.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   But look at them after this day of Pentecost and here they are, a phenomenon, speaking
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   with other tongues, able to tell the wonderful works of God in all languages and dialects,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   everybody hearing them.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   "What is this?"
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   "Son," said, "these men are drunk."
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   And you know, unless we as Christian people give the world the impression that we are
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.480]   mad, we are being very poor Christians.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.480]   If the world can understand you, you are not a Christian.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   The Christian is a miracle.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.480]   He is supernatural, he is divine.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   God has done something in him that the world doesn't understand.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   And the world thinks it's drunkenness, it's lunacy, it's madness.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   But that's Christianity.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   And this pseudo-philosophy that's being offered as gospel today is just an utter denial of
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   the very essence of the gospel.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   It's not a gospel at all.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   It's just humanism using a little bit of Christian terminology.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   But you see, here is a great supernatural, miraculous event, Pentecost.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   And then you listen to Peter preaching.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   Peter the fisherman.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   And three thousand people are converted.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   "What's this?
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   Is this Peter's eloquence?
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   Is this Peter's erudition?"
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   Of course it isn't.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   It's the power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   He's filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   He's a miracle.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   The people listening are pricked in their hearts.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   They're convicted.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   They're disturbed.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   They're made unhappy.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   They cry out saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   Is this Peter?"
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   Of course it isn't.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   This is God.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   The power of the Spirit of God in him, using him as a vehicle, an instrument, a channel,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   and doing this mighty work.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   The apostles were changed and these other people were changed.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   And watch them as they go along.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   Read this book of Acts.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   Go back over the chapters we've already considered, the first six chapters.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   Peter and John go up to the temple one afternoon at the hour of prayer to say their prayers.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   They're accosted by a poor fellow, lame from his mother's womb, who was carried every day
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   and put to sit on the pavement outside the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   And he asked alms of them.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   He begged of them.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   And they hadn't got anything to give him.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   But Peter and John, fastening their eyes upon him, looked at him and said, "Look on us."
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   And he looked at them, expecting to receive something of them.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee in the name
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   Rise up and walk."
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   Peter stretched out his hand and caught hold of the man's hand.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   And the man immediately sprang to his feet.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   And in a few moments, look at him.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   There he is going into the house of God, walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   A man who'd been born lame and for whom the science of the time could do nothing at all.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   My dear friends, this is it.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   And then, of course, the crowd loses its head and says, "Peter has done this.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   He must be some sort of magician.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.480]   He must be some sort of seer.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   Who are these wonderful men?"
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   And then Peter says, "Don't look on us, John and myself, as if by our own power or holiness
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   we had made these men to walk."
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   It isn't we who've done it.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   It is his name, Christ's, his name, through faith in his name that has given him this
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   soundness, perfect soundness, in the presence of you all.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.480]   My friends, this is Christianity, a supernatural, miraculous power.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.480]   Why, you've got an example in the fourth chapter of this book.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   We've already considered it.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   Peter and John, again on trial, threatened that if they go on preaching this message
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   that they'll be put to death.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   At last, they're set at liberty and they go back to their own company and they rehearse
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   to them everything that had happened to them.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   And then the church immediately begins to pray.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   With one accord, they lifted up their voice to God, saying, "Lord, thou art God who has
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.480]   made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is."
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   They remind God of his glorious power and then they say, "Behold their threatenings,
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   and O Lord, give us power, give us ability."
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   That was their prayer.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   You remember the reply?
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   The place was shaken where they were assembled together.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   The building was shaken.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   This is God.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   My dear friends, this is a supernatural, this is a miraculous gospel, this is the action
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   of God himself.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   He's a living God, he's an acting God, he's not an abstraction, he's not a philosophic
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   concept, he is the living God.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   And all things are under the hand of his power and all things are manifestations of his glory.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.480]   And if you go on to the fifth chapter of the book of this Acts of the Apostles, you'll
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.480]   find two people called Ananias and Sapphira.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   They told a lie.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   They did it to suit their own ends and purposes, but what they didn't realize is what Peter
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   told them.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   He said, "You haven't lied unto men, you've lied unto God."
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   And they both fell down dead.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   You don't like that.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   I don't say that I like it, but I'm not here to say what I like.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   I'm simply telling you that God who can give birth can cause death.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   He can strike dead.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.480]   He struck Ananias and Sapphira dead.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.480]   It was judicial punishment.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   You don't understand that.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   I don't expect you do, but I don't expect you to do either.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   I know how limited you are and how limited I am myself.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   If I were preaching something that I could understand or you could understand, it wouldn't
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   be a gospel.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   I'm preaching the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   Eternal God.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   Eternal God, how pure the soul must be that placed within thy searching sight it shrinks
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   not, but with calm delight can live and look on thee.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   That's the God I'm preaching.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible hid from our eyes, most blessed,
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   most glorious, the ancient of days, pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   That's the God I'm speaking about.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   God with whom nothing is impossible.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   The God who can multiply the number of the children of Israel when he chooses to do so.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   Can turn the heart of a king and the people against them.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   Can cause the birth of a child.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   Can turn the heart of the daughter of Pharaoh to the child and rescue him and adopt him.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   This is the message.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   The God of the impossible.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   The living, acting God with whom nothing is impossible.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   So you go on reading this wonderful book of Acts and it's a book of miracles.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   The way these men escape from prisons when everything is against them.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   It's child's play if I may use such an expression to God.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   God plays with the stars and the comets and the constellations as if they were but marbles.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.480]   He's over all.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.480]   He's made all.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   He sustains all.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   He controls all.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   Nothing is outside the ambit of his control.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   Kings, princes, men, women, dynasties, centuries.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   Everything is under God.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   This is the message.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   And that my dear friend is the thing that you and I have to understand at the very beginning of this gospel.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   The only hope for any one of us this evening
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:33.480]   is that this God has acted for our salvation once and forever in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   And there is nothing that he cannot do.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.480]   Oh, that's why it's such a wonderful thing to be preaching such a gospel.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.480]   I'm not preaching moral reformation.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   I'm not here to appeal to you to live better lives.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   I know you can't do it.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   Many of you were foolish enough to make New Year resolutions a few weeks back.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.480]   You've forgotten all about them by now.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   Don't be foolish.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   Don't waste your time.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   You can't keep them.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   They're not worth the paper they're written on
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   or the breath that you give reluttering them.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   You can't do it.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   Thank God that isn't the gospel.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   I am here to tell you that God can save you.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   That God can change you.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   You've been struggling.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   You've used your willpower.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   But you can't do it.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   You're failing.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   Of course you can't.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   But the gospel tells you that his blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   His blood availed for me.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   This is the message.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   The lame can leap as an heart.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   The blind can see.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.480]   The deaf are raised.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   There's nothing that is impossible.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.480]   And this, you see, is the only hope this evening.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   There is no hope otherwise.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   It is the action of God.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   And what he says is that he can create you anew.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   He can give you a rebirth.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   He can give you a new heart.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   A new beginning.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   He can give you a new start.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   It isn't reformation.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   It isn't improvement.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   It is regeneration.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   Listen to the magnificent words of Paul in 2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   hath shined in our hearts
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   Listen to him again to the Ephesians.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   You hath he quickened
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   who were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   He can give you life.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   He can quicken the dead.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.480]   He can bring into being something that isn't there.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   He's the almighty creator.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   Or if you prefer it, take it in the words
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   that our blessed Lord himself used to that great man,
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   that great teacher in Israel, Nicodemus.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   You must be born again.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.480]   But Nicodemus doesn't understand this.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   He says, how can a man be born when he's old?
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   How sayest thou ye must be born again?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   And our Lord answers him with these wonderful words.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:03.480]   That which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.480]   And that which is born of the spirit is spirit.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   Marvel not that I said unto thee,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   ye must be born again.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   The wind bloweth where it listeth.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   Thou hearest the sound thereof,
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   but canst not tell whence it cometh,
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   nor whither it goeth.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   So is every one that is born of the spirit.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   You can't understand it.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   It's a miracle, comparable to the action of the wind.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   You only see the effects and results.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   You don't understand the marvel, the mystery.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   It's God.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   It's the Creator taking hold of you, remolding you,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   fashioning you anew, giving you a new life,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   a new nature, a new heart, a new everything.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   That's the gospel.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   We must leave it at that for this evening
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   and go on with it again next Sunday night.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   But my dear friend, have you got hold of this?
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.480]   This is the essence of this message,
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   that the living, eternal God is acting, is active,
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   is concerned, is made a way of salvation.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   He can save you.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   He can do for you what you can never do for yourself,
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   what the whole world and the whole universe
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   can never do for you.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   Not all the future centuries,
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   any more than the past centuries,
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   but with God.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   Nothing shall be impossible.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   Tell me, has the God that affected the wounds
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   of the women of Israel and made them increase
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   and multiply in a miraculous manner
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.480]   as He started dealing with you?
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   Are you aware of the touch of God upon you?
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   Have you felt a power greater than yourself
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   beginning to deal?
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   This is it.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   Submit to Him.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   Give in to Him.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   Don't resist Him.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   Allow Him to go on with the blessed work
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.480]   and He can make of you a new man,
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   a new woman,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.480]   who will live to His glory and to His praise.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   Amen.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching
