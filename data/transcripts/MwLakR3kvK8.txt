[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.020]   We have a stack of about 60 emails from listeners in Scotland and the United
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.720]   States and India who all want to know about yoga. Is yoga a mere physical
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   exercise or is it unavoidably a participation in Eastern spirituality?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.560]   One of our listeners named Todd writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, as a
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.960]   healthcare professional, I am interested in the benefits of Eastern practices
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.680]   like yoga and Tai Chi for the documented health benefits they offer. Can a
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.840]   Christian practice such things with roots in mysticism in good conscience?"
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.400]   What would you say, Pastor John? One of the first things I would say is that
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.440]   there are two kinds of approaches to questionable practices in life. One I
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.760]   would call a minimalist approach to holiness and godliness, and the other
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.520]   maximalist. In other words, in the first case your typical question is, "Well,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.960]   what's wrong with it?" You know, and it would apply to movies and music, and
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.080]   kids often ask their parents, "What's wrong with it?" And the other approach
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.960]   is not to ask what's wrong with it mainly, but "Will it make me more Christ-like?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.920]   Will it make me more devoted to Jesus? Will I be more powerful and full of
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960]   the Holy Spirit? Will I be more effective in prayer because of it? Will it make me
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.240]   more bold in witness or weaken me? Will it help me be spiritually discerning of
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.120]   the ways of Satan in the world? And will it help me lay up treasures in heaven?
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.940]   Will it help me find joy in God and all that he is for me in Jesus?" You can see
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.600]   that there's these two kinds of approaches to life. I want to maximize my
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.200]   godliness and my holiness by drawing nearer and nearer to God, and the other
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.600]   one is just trying to do as many things as you can do without being tripped up
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   explicitly by sin. So I don't mean to suggest by that that every time you face
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.360]   a questionable activity you will opt for renunciation because you have weighed
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.720]   things that way. I just want people to approach questions with the greatest
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.560]   passions for godliness, the greatest passions, and not think minimalistically.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.760]   That's the first thing I'd want to say. Secondly, I would want to say that yoga
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   and Tai Chi, the little I know and the little research I've done, both have
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.320]   their roots in Eastern worldviews and are profoundly, in those roots,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   antithetical to Christian understanding of God and the way he works in the world.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:57.440]   So yoga is to the body—I'd put it any way—what mantra is to the mouth. One
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.560]   explanation says that the mantra, quote, "One has to chant a word or a phrase
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.800]   until he or she transcends mind and emotions, and in the process the
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.440]   superconscious is discovered and achieved," close quote. So the use of word
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   in that mantra-like way in order to move into the superconsciousness. In other
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   words, yoga exercises are spillover from that kind of verbal repetition and
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.680]   philosophy of how one moves physically and emotionally, intellectually to this
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.360]   superconsciousness. So yoga focuses on harmony between mind and body. Yoga
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.280]   derives its philosophy from an Indian metaphysical belief, and the word "yoga"
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.120]   comes from the Sanskrit language and means "merger" or "union," and the ultimate aim
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.440]   of that philosophy then is to strike a balance between mind and body and
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.920]   attain a kind of self-enlightenment through the use of mantra and
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.280]   through the use of certain kinds of physical exercises or meditative stances.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   To achieve this, yoga uses breath, posture, relaxation, meditation, in order to bring
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.000]   about healthy, lively, balanced approach to life. That would be more or less the way
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   they'd say it in a lot of places on the web. So if you go to the
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.880]   Minneapolis YWCA website and click on "fitness classes," you get 22 references to
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   yoga, including beginning yoga, MS yoga, youngster yoga, youth dance and yoga, yoga
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.200]   for everybody, and it's the same thing with Tai Chi, a little less so.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.600]   Tai Chi has Chinese religious or metaphysical roots, and one definition
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.880]   says that Tai Chi is understood to be the highest conceivable principle from
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.400]   which existence flows. The supreme ultimate—that's what the word
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.320]   Tai Chi means—the supreme ultimate creates yang and yin, movement
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.080]   generates yang, and when its activity reaches its limit, it becomes
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.920]   tranquil, and through tranquility, the supreme ultimate generates yin, and when
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.680]   the tranquility has reached its limit, there is a return to movement, and
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.480]   movement and tranquility and alteration become each the source of the other, and
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.880]   the transformations of the yang and the union of the yin produce everything, and
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.800]   these in turn produce and reproduce, and that makes the process never-ending.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.720]   That's more or less what I've learned in my little bit of research. And Christians
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.640]   have a radically different worldview than either of these, or the view
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.440]   shaped by yoga, the view shaped by Tai Chi. Our approach towards history and
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   towards God and towards well-being is radically different. In Christianity,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.720]   progress toward wholeness moves from a God who communicates intelligibly
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.240]   through language to be understood, through a person, Jesus Christ, who
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.640]   becomes fully human and speaks to be understood by the mind—not the
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.800]   canceling of the mind—through his death and resurrection, objectively overcoming
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.920]   a real Satan and real guilt before God, through a real gospel message for us,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   once for all in history, with historical events behind it, through an
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.320]   understanding of that message in our minds consciously, through faith in
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.840]   Christ, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, through the promises
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.640]   understood and believed, through joyful meditation on those objective promises,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   through the transformation of the Holy Spirit, through objective Word
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.680]   understood as we meditate in progressive likeness to Christ as we see his glory
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.440]   in the Word and in the gospel, through practical deeds that lead to help other
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.920]   people, and through a life of transformed godliness into eternal life where God is
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.840]   our joy forever. That's Christianity, and it's totally different than the
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.080]   kind of worldview that lies behind the meditative, physical, and emotional, and
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.000]   intellectual practices that flow out of yoga and Tai Chi. Christians'
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.160]   wholeness of the health and the body—if you ask, "Okay, how does that relate to
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   the body? How does that relate to exercise and stuff you do with your body?" I would
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:51.480]   say Christian wholeness of the health of the body is a chastened and realistic
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.920]   view marked by these facts. Number one, we are fallen and physically under a curse
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.320]   and emotionally and intellectually under a curse on the whole creation, and
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.800]   therefore we will all die. Second, we will be raised from the dead if we have faith
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.920]   in Jesus, and this is the health we are ultimately aiming at. Mainly, we would be
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.200]   perfectly healthy, body, soul, and mind in the new heavens and the new earth after
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.280]   the resurrection, and that is our glory. That is our hope. And third, in the
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.600]   meantime, our outer nature is wasting away, but our inner nature is being
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:40.160]   renewed day by day. And fourth, so bodily exercise is of a little value, as Paul
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.240]   says, but spiritual exercise is of value in every way in the way I described it a
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:53.960]   minute ago. And fifth, we should not necessarily, unnecessarily, damage our
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.000]   bodies, which are the temple of the Holy Spirit, and we should seek their maximal
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.680]   usefulness in the goals that God has given us. So physical health is wonderful,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.360]   but it's not the goal. It is a means to much greater goals, and a qualified means
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.000]   at that, because they're more important means than having a body that is super
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.800]   fit. We may—this would be number six—we may accomplish our greatest goals by
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.760]   dying, by risking our lives in getting Ebola or malaria or river blindness in
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.160]   some missionary activity. We don't strive for maximal physical well-being.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.800]   That is a subordinate useful goal as a means to something greater, and it may be
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.280]   compromised intentionally by risking our lives for the sake of somebody else. And
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.640]   the last thing would be, so any physical regimen that begins to take the
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.520]   place of the pursuit of holiness and sacrificial service by which we may lay
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.560]   down our lives is starting probably to become a religion for us. And it seems to
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.360]   me that yoga and Tai Chi have already declared themselves by their very names
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   on that score. They have run up the flag. They've run up the flag of the Eastern
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.560]   worldview by the very name yoga and Tai Chi. So for my money at this point, as I
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.440]   assess maximizing rather than minimizing my pursuit of God's goals and the
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.240]   flourishing of my own soul, I'd go another way and find another kind of
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   exercise. Well there you have it. John Piper on yoga and Tai Chi. Thank you,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.200]   Pastor John. No doubt there's going to be follow-up questions on this one. You can
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.080]   send your follow-up questions to us on this episode or any episode. Send us an
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.920]   email at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. And we now get about 1,500
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.840]   emails a month, so we cannot respond individually, but we do get them. Good
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.360]   questions that are specific and concise are essential to this podcast, and we are
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.000]   grateful for those of you who send them in to us. And we have a question coming
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.120]   in from Ireland on the table tomorrow. "What is love? In fact, it's the most
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.360]   often asked question at Google." That's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
