[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   And I feel like when people talk about the dopamine hits of social media, the data on
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.920]   this just don't square with the idea that scrolling our phone gives us dopamine hits.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.000]   It gives us low-level expenditure.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.140]   You know, I want to, on the basis of your books, I wrote something down a couple days
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.400]   ago.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.860]   I was thinking about our conversation.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.400]   I was thinking, I've long believed that, you know, dopamine is a currency.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.020]   We, it's the universal currency of motivation, right?
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.820]   It's what literally allows us to ambulate forward.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.380]   It controls movement in the body.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.100]   That's why people with Parkinson's who lose dopamine neurons can't move.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.820]   But in terms of mental movement, it's motivation, like movement towards something, redirecting
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.960]   our efforts and so forth.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.740]   And I was thinking about this idea that we can either spend our dopamine, right, or we
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.040]   can invest our dopamine.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.360]   And this is purely on the basis of your work.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.720]   Awesome.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.760]   And it seems like all day long, we can potentially spend dopamine.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.820]   Scrolling is spending.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.040]   And it's the kind of spending we don't even notice that we're doing.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.420]   We're sort of leaking.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.960]   It's almost like leaking dopamine.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.560]   We're not getting these big, quote unquote, dopamine hits.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.380]   This is why I don't like the dopamine hit model.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.700]   I don't log on Instagram and go like, wow.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.700]   Like, it's no, like, it's not like coming back from a misogy and going, I lived.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.300]   It's not transformative for the next month.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.660]   It keeps you in the rut of looking for more because it's like mental chewing gum.
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.460]   It's my dad.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.760]   A long time ago, he said, be careful of the internet.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.580]   I said, why?
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.380]   And he said, it's just mental chewing gum.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.420]   Wise, wise guy.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.160]   Yeah, and he's a very regimented guy.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.940]   And so we're always spending.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.460]   But then there are these things that require effort that are in â€“ we're still spending
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.540]   dopamine while we're doing it.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.160]   Like, if you go do a workout, you're spending effort to do it, but you get something back
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   on that investment.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280]   So you're investing it.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.340]   You're not just spending it.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.960]   And the other one, based on what you told me today, is reflection in states of boredom
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.620]   or meditation or, you know, for people that orient this way, prayer, whatever it happens
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.040]   to be.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.100]   Or maybe it's even just leaving a social gathering and keeping your phone in your pocket and walking
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.040]   back to the car and just really thinking about the richness of that interaction.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.900]   Like, these little things that are disappearing in our lives these days, but that are so easy
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.560]   to recapture, that reflection is another way of investing our dopamine.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.940]   And I think when we look at the neurobiological literature on dopamine, we're going to realize
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.040]   that, yeah, of course, addictions spend out your dopamine.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   Drop your baseline.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.700]   Your bank account is in the red, deep in the red.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.600]   It's a whole other discussion.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.180]   But that most of us are spending, and then we reset each night with sleep.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.960]   And then we spend the next day, and then we reset.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   And it's a life of, it becomes kind of a meaningless life.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.740]   And this isn't to demonize the social media platforms.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.340]   They're pretty good at letting us numb out when we don't want to feel something or feel
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.280]   drama when we need to feel that, like, lift.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.100]   Like, oh, my God, she did that.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.880]   He did that.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.400]   Oh, my God, the lawsuit got dismissed about these two people who are arguing about who said
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.100]   what and who did.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.320]   I'm like, how boring is it, really?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.060]   And how unimportant is it?
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.680]   But it's not boring because they've taught us how to make it not boring.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.580]   Yeah, totally.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.420]   And then you look at the comments, and it's like, blech.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.380]   It's just, like, gross.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.560]   It's like high school forever.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.240]   But the worst part of high school.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.180]   It effectively trains us to use it.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.400]   So when I think about comfort crisis or scarcity brain, I'm saying it's really about how to
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.620]   invest your dopamine in effort and reflection as a way to capture more capability to lean
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.260]   into things.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.060]   That's really, to me, what I like is the genius of doing hard things that you brought forward
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.000]   in the comfort crisis.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.200]   As I started today's discussion saying, I mean, it really changed my every day because
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.520]   I think so intensely now about, like, how can I introduce more pain to bring about more
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.640]   meaning as opposed to comfort, like, meaning in any case.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.320]   So, yeah, I think you're really on to the two things that matter most, which are effort
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.400]   and reflection.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.640]   I love that language of spending versus investing.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   It's just, yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head there.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.660]   And the investing is usually things that are going to be a little more challenging, not as
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.500]   hyper-stimulating, things you maybe wouldn't necessarily want to do at first.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.880]   And then once you've done them enough, you realize, oh, this has really changed me in a
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.360]   fundamental and positive way.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.660]   And hopefully you start to sort of crave them.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.400]   Like you said, no, I love exercise, right?
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.440]   That's where we want people to get with all sorts of things that can enhance their life.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.800]   And I think, too, I'll add here.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.940]   So if you think about people who pile up money and pile up money and invest and invest and
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.640]   invest and they never spend it, maybe you also need to learn, okay, now that I'm doing all
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.540]   this investing, it's also okay to spend it sometimes, right?
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.240]   And then I can really enjoy that because I've done all these things.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:21.340]   And so I find with my own use, I used to sort of beat myself up if I was on, say, Instagram
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.180]   or whatever, just looking at nonsense.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.220]   I like nonsense on Instagram.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.380]   And I would beat myself up.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.940]   And then I realized, you've done all these things.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.720]   Like you wrote for five hours.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.080]   You got a workout in.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.000]   You took your dog for a walk.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.160]   You helped out around the house.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.880]   You did all these things.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.040]   Dude, watch a freaking dog video for 20 minutes.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.640]   So it's fine.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.800]   And then I could actually appreciate that more and like I didn't have the guilt around
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.440]   that, you know?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.260]   And it was like sort of the, all right, you've invested a bunch.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.320]   You got all this money.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.780]   Yeah, buy that thing you don't necessarily need, but it's a nice little boost, you know?
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.580]   The idea that we all have to become these sickos that love self-punishment and service to just
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.560]   building up more dopamine reserves, that's definitely not the goal.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.040]   I mean, I think one of the reasons that David Goggins is so popular is, well, there are many
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.520]   reasons.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.800]   A, he is how he appears online.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   I mean, I've known David since before he had a book, since before his first book.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.640]   He was exactly that way.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.480]   He was exactly that way.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.120]   He's not playing a role, right?
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.880]   There's no acting.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.020]   This is how he functions.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.440]   That's great.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.780]   It's a life that most people are not going to embrace.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.100]   And if they do embrace it partially, I think it will benefit them tremendously.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.660]   But he sort of embodies that.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.920]   He, excuse me, he doesn't sort of embody that.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.180]   He embodies that.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.240]   I think that being able to relax and enjoy things and really savor them is another source of,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.480]   I won't say everything's investing, but there are certain things that might look like spending
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.140]   your dopamine that are actually investing them.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.500]   And you described a beautiful one as walking with your wife, these long, these long hikes
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:05.420]   and walks, like real relating, in-person relating, I think makes us feel so many things.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.540]   I mean, there's so much science and psychology about this.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.240]   I mean, we definitely evolved to, to connect to other humans.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.800]   Absolutely.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.060]   You know, so I, I don't think of it as meaningless relaxation to, to just connect with people
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.120]   and have a barbecue and just relax or just whatever they call it, like Netflix and
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.880]   chill can be a great thing if it's not the only thing.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.360]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.480]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   I don't think of it as well.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   I don't think of it as well.
