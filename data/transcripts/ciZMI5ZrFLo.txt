[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   How sophisticated do you have to be to launder tens of billions of dollars around?
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.800]   SBF did that, so that is a bar for sophistication.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.840]   He was eventually caught.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.240]   He was not caught for laundering tens of billions of dollars around.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.440]   He wasn't even under suspicion for laundering tens of billions of dollars around.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400]   SBF was Tether's banker.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   Alameda Research, one of the parts of like the corporate shell game that they were playing,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.080]   moved tens of billions of dollars of cash around the financial system, largely under
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.720]   like full color of law on behalf of Tether to move it from wherever Tether had it, goodness
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.840]   knows, or wherever their buying customers had it, to, I think at the moment it's mostly
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.760]   at Cantor Fitzgerald.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   Some shoe has to eventually drop there.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   I will eat a lot of popcorn when it does, but be that as it may.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.800]   SBF was extremely sophisticated, like a person, not just SBF, I think people identify him
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.120]   uniquely where they identify the inner circle uniquely as being a fault here.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.640]   There was an entire power structure there, which was extremely adept at figuring out
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.680]   how power worked in the United States and exercising it towards their own ends.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.800]   And then it blew up.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.560]   But until then, goodness, they decided we need regulatory licenses, they're called money
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.960]   transmission licenses in the United States, and those are done on a state by state basis.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.240]   They got 50 regulators to sign off on it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.520]   There were many objective indicia of them being very good at their jobs until they lost
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   all the money.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.260]   But it was more about politically getting people to look the other way rather than we
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.200]   figured out how to structure the wire in a way that won't get flagged.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.640]   It's not merely a matter of getting them to look the other way.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.960]   But if you go back to the original SBF interviews where he's telling the founding myth of Alameda,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.520]   he says like very loudly, "The reason why I got this opportunity to do Bitcoin arbitrage
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.280]   between Japan and the United States is because I was able to do something that the rest of
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   the world wasn't.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   I was able to," he doesn't say this in this many words, I will say it, "suborn a Japanese
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.360]   bank because you need that as one of the pieces to run this arab, and then I pulled tens of
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.400]   millions of dollars out of this."
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.960]   I don't think people really listened to what he was saying there, and he literally says
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.560]   in the interview on Bloomberg, "If I was a compliance person, this would look like the
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.720]   sketchiest thing in the world.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   This looks like it's obviously money laundering because it is money laundering."
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.080]   And then, interestingly, Michael Lewis retells this story, and he locates the story in South
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.880]   Korea rather than in Japan, and some people who were involved say, "We tried it in South
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.760]   Korea and Japan," which people would like pull on more threads there.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.800]   Like there's still lots of that story that we don't know.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.560]   But anyhow, there's many other ways to launder money.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   You can do things like, let's say I establish a shell corporation, and I buy a piece of
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.160]   real estate in New York City, and then I rent that real estate out to people, and I collect
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.360]   a stream of rents from that, and that money looks clean because there is an excluded business.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   It's my shell corporation that is renting this real estate that really exists to a totally
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   legitimate person.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.840]   This money is clean, and the money that I put into the system to buy this on behalf
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.200]   of the shell corporation, I'm just going to wire it to a lawyer, and the lawyer's going
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.960]   to answer any question from the bank with, "I don't know where it came from.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   I don't have to tell you.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   I'm a lawyer.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   It's a real estate transaction.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   What do you want from me?"
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   In one sense, that's money laundering.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   If the original money was the proceeds of crime, in another sense, that's how every
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.320]   real estate transaction goes down at those scales.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.360]   And so, often, a facility at money laundering is one facility at operating the economy,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.160]   plus willingness to do that to hide the proceeds of some other crime.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.800]   I think I would be really good at money laundering.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm glad I haven't done it professionally, but it's fascinating intellectually.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.960]   Previous communications departments I've worked at probably would explicitly anti-endorse
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   that sense.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   What can one do?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.840]   We are originally confident that you're not laundering money.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.640]   I would be much wealthier if I was.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   I'm a lawyer.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   I'm a lawyer.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   I'm a lawyer.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   I'm a lawyer.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
