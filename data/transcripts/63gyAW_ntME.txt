[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   I am committing right now to align my entire future to that.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's like a personal fork in the road.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.720]   So I said, I am going to align my life.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.300]   And then after that prayer, I was like, I don't want to open this Bible.
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.340]   What would you say to our church about Vietnam?
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.620]   Vietnam is kind of at the brink of some sort of spiritual revival.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.440]   All right, hello.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.700]   Welcome to the official, unofficial Acts 2 Network podcast.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.040]   Welcome.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.200]   Where we are launching lifelong kingdom workers from every college town.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.840]   My name is Stephen.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.400]   I'm Isaiah.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.380]   And today we have Pastor Daniel and Sarah.
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.220]   Thank you guys for coming on.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.340]   We want to talk to you guys a lot about foreign missions.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.520]   You guys recently came back from leading one of our teams to visit our foreign mission teams
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.980]   there and provide some support and help and that sort of thing.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.180]   But before we do, why don't you guys just introduce yourselves a little bit?
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.260]   What's your current role in our network?
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.480]   What year did you graduate?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.140]   Who's your peers, I guess?
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.500]   And yeah, that sort of thing.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.700]   Yeah, I'm Daniel and I guess I'm a director.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.540]   I mean, I now live in SoCal in LA, West LA.
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.160]   So I oversee a lot of the SoCal churches, inner SoCal, mostly inner SoCal, like UCLA, USC,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.180]   those campus ministries.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.500]   I mean, there's leaders there already, but then where I'm just kind of like hanging out.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.800]   That's a bug.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.120]   It's like, what's going on here?
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.380]   Someone's got to do it.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.660]   Yeah, somebody's got to do that.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.460]   Somebody's got to look in.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.440]   Hey, hey, how's it going?
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.600]   What is the director?
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.960]   So I graduated in 1995.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.560]   Okay.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.580]   1995 as an electrical engineering, computer science major.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.160]   I think I was the first one in our church.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.680]   Really?
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   No, I'm sure there were others before you.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.580]   What?
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.780]   Who?
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.720]   Name one.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.980]   I mean, they're not here anymore.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.020]   I don't think they were all either doctors or lawyers.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.780]   I was the first nerd.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.300]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.680]   Yeah, that might be, huh?
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.940]   What did Peter talk about?
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.780]   No, Mackey.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.480]   Oh, Mackey.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.280]   Yeah, Mackey.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.500]   All right, yeah.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.660]   Okay, I'm Sarah.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.500]   I graduated in 1994.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.980]   I was an English major, and then I went to law school, and now I'm directing SoCal.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.680]   SoCal churches.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.580]   Hovering next to Pastor Daniel.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.960]   Cool, cool.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.480]   So, you know, I think sometimes we think of directors, like, whoa,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   we're like, you're the directors.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.860]   You must have, I don't know, grown up on Director Island
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.480]   and fallen off a director tree or something like that.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.840]   But you guys were college students back in 95, so 91.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.620]   That was when we were one years old.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.100]   Some of the people listening to this podcast weren't before yet.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.780]   Yeah, so how did it all begin?
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.760]   Like, when did you first come to our church as college students?
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.840]   Yeah, as you become Christian, that sort of, yeah.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.840]   Well, I became a Christian before our church.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.860]   I was a sophomore in high school.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.480]   I became a Christian, and I was looking for, actually,
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.800]   a church that would disciple me.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.840]   I came, but then I was actually a kind of a lone ranger.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.220]   I, yeah, I experienced some pretty extreme hypocrisy
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.900]   in the old church that I was attending.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.800]   I mean, I'm talking, like, pretty, like,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.180]   during the church congregational meeting,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.640]   we had to call the police because the elders started to get into fistfights.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.160]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820]   It's like, it was that kind of a situation.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.600]   Someone else today also said that.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   Oh, really?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.240]   It's a Korean thing.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.940]   Taekwondo, you know.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.200]   That's what happens.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.700]   So, I was like, oh, church is a failed institution.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.400]   So, then I just kind of came in with that kind of baggage
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.680]   and saying, oh, church is not really necessary.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.940]   But I did go to church, you know, with our church,
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.580]   and then I would go back every other weekend
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.880]   to the San Jose church that I came from.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.600]   So, I just go back.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.220]   You wanted intense establishment,
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.520]   but you're also, like, lone ranger.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.780]   kind of thing.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.020]   Just help me along my path.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.760]   Kind of, that's what church was for.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.680]   I thought the church was for that.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.120]   How lone ranger were you?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.860]   Like, what do you, like?
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.460]   Yeah, I would, like, I went.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.620]   Nobody knew who he was.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.360]   Did you know who he was?
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.880]   I didn't know.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.120]   I didn't know who he was.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.100]   So, you came on, like, Sundays, I guess.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.920]   I came on Sundays.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.580]   Sometimes.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.600]   And Fridays.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.760]   I did come on Friday.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.300]   I just took off.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.500]   But only, like, sporadically,
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.780]   because you went to the other church.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.400]   So, I would do that.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.140]   And I went on two lone ranger mission trips
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.720]   to China, actually.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.100]   Wow.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.980]   By myself.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.780]   And I got dropped off at a, you know,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.520]   at a village.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.320]   And then, well, I thought that the missionary
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.580]   that I was, like, I had contact with
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.860]   would be with me.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.780]   But he just dropped me off.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.380]   He just dropped me off
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.140]   because I'll see you in a week.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.060]   And I'm like, okay.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.780]   But then, I thought it was really cool.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.440]   And it was, like,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.380]   so, then I taught some people over there.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.320]   Actually, it was right above North Korea.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.420]   So, they spoke North Korean.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.980]   I mean, Korean.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.380]   So, I was able to communicate.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.900]   Okay.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.380]   So, then, after that,
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.880]   it was actually,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.620]   that mission trip had good and bad.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.800]   I was really touched.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.000]   And I felt like this was
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.240]   what life is meant for.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.000]   But at the same time,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.080]   like, my lone rangerism
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.320]   just grew more and more
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.780]   deeply entrenched.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.500]   It's like I could do it myself.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.960]   Wow.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.480]   So.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.960]   Oh, so, for me,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.860]   I came into college
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.240]   wanting to run away from church.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.280]   I grew up going to church
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.920]   all my life.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.520]   But I met some guys
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   who were doing Bible study
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.180]   with Pastor Ed,
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.100]   Isaac's dad.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.240]   He was, like,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   our class baby, actually.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.680]   He was a one-year-old.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   You were their class baby.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.500]   Yeah, he was.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.660]   I have no memory of that.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.800]   Really?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.940]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.560]   And then,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.260]   they changed a lot.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.660]   And they were so excited
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.280]   about the Bible.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.460]   So, when I started
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.460]   getting spiritually hungry,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.920]   I wanted to go
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.780]   where they were going.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.580]   And so,
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.300]   I started coming
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   and became a Christian
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.520]   at the end of my junior year.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.680]   and that's about
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.320]   the same time
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.020]   I noticed him
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.020]   because he suddenly
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.640]   appeared in this
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.460]   church production.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.500]   And he was really funny.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.140]   Christian festival.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.340]   That's when I started
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.780]   to finally come regularly.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.240]   I didn't notice him,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.720]   notice him.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.340]   I just, like,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.100]   recognized that,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.900]   oh, there's that guy.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.320]   Who's that guy?
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.360]   What role were you in?
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.060]   I played the role
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.520]   of, like,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.740]   the,
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.960]   this Asian,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.060]   It was very,
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.080]   un-PC.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   Very un-PC.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.180]   But I was just,
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.940]   I was a doctor,
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.480]   I was, like,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.320]   a person.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.560]   A Chinese,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.480]   um,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.700]   like, yeah.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.620]   Heavy Chinese accent.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.620]   Three days!
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.800]   I was basically
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.740]   a resurrection on trial.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.980]   It was, like,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.580]   an apologetics
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.400]   about resurrection
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.640]   of Jesus.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.020]   And I had the,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.820]   I had this,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.120]   yeah.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.280]   The role where it's,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.420]   like,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.160]   three days,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.780]   too long.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.380]   Three hours,
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.760]   maybe.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.500]   Oh, that's,
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.160]   three minutes,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.500]   maybe.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.620]   And we had no Chinese
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.320]   people back then,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   so that was offensive.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.020]   My question is,
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.380]   why make it a Chinese?
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.820]   Because he was supposed
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.260]   to be, like,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.760]   a lab,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.360]   like a lab.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.020]   Yeah, like,
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.380]   scientists.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.940]   Scientists are Chinese.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.660]   Well, it was supposed
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.220]   to be Korean,
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.580]   I guess,
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.240]   but I just made it
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.720]   into Chinese.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.640]   So that's just,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.600]   that's just how it worked.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.840]   Got it.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.400]   Different,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   different era.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.340]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yeah,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.380]   we've come a long way.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.260]   that was too much.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.760]   Wow.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.480]   All right.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.760]   So what made you guys
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.840]   want to stay
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.020]   in our church
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.240]   and continue to do ministry?
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   I mean,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.380]   you've done it for now
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.580]   30-something years.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.080]   For me,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.940]   I think it was a huge
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.500]   repentance
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.140]   that happened
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.860]   in the senior year.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.080]   My perception
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.400]   of Christian,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.500]   Christian life
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.680]   was a lone ranger,
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.160]   a lone path,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.060]   journey
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.900]   towards spiritual maturity
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.420]   and church
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.160]   was supposed to sort of
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.140]   be the stepping stone
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.940]   that I step on
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.360]   different churches
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.920]   to kind of
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.300]   go along the way.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.700]   And I guess
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.460]   that was a question
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.460]   that kind of arose
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.900]   to me around that time.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.320]   It was like,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.900]   hey,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.520]   regardless of what church,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.920]   we're not talking
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.560]   about which church,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.340]   but would I,
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.680]   would I commit
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.360]   to any church
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   in the future?
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.180]   Would I commit
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.920]   to any church?
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.600]   and I kind of knew
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.980]   that the right answer
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.580]   is yes?
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.220]   Like some church,
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.900]   I should commit
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.580]   to some church.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.480]   But I didn't really know,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.060]   like I was like,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.400]   I don't think I would.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.980]   So then that really
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.360]   started to kind of
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.680]   bother me.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.820]   And I remember
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.000]   just struggling
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.540]   about that
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.080]   for a long,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.620]   long time,
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.640]   for about a month,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.940]   actually.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.720]   about a month,
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.420]   I was just kind of
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.400]   struggling with it
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.780]   in a pretty intense way
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.280]   because I wanted
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.620]   an answer to
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.340]   what place
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.300]   does a church hold
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   in a Christian life?
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.080]   That's interesting.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.240]   You had such a strong sense
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   that like it should,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.960]   but then I wouldn't.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.480]   So like,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.080]   why is that?
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:17.880]   It's really interesting.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.980]   Well,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.800]   I guess maybe
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.500]   I didn't even know
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.660]   if that was the right answer.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.600]   I just had an inkling
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.060]   that it might be
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.580]   the right answer.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.460]   So I wanted to find,
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.020]   I wanted to kind of,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.280]   yeah,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.020]   search the scriptures
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.780]   or something like that.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.120]   But then
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.040]   I knew that
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.560]   I could pick
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   and choose any verse
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.580]   to justify
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.440]   a Lone Ranger
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.200]   Christian life
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.820]   versus like a Christian life
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.640]   as it is supposed
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.360]   to be a community
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.000]   kind of life.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.180]   So then
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.600]   I just went
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.160]   back and forth
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.660]   on this.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.380]   And then one day
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.680]   I just,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.380]   well,
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.040]   my small group leader
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.200]   said,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.380]   hey,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.720]   let's go to
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.580]   our entire small group
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.180]   decided to go
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.080]   to a reading retreat
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.140]   to this scary
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.560]   Catholic place
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.120]   called the Mercy Center
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.820]   where like the
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.460]   paintings like
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.040]   look at you
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.080]   in dark hallways.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.940]   Yeah,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.800]   so it's like that.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.760]   But then it was like
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.700]   reading retreat back then
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.380]   was a really
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.980]   a reading retreat
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.180]   because,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:06.340]   you know,
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.820]   this is remember,
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.480]   this is before
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.120]   like cell phones
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.520]   or smartphones
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.240]   or anything like that.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.640]   And each of us
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.000]   was,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.980]   we got one room
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.240]   and we got into
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.660]   this room
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.300]   and it was just
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.340]   a bed
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.080]   and a desk
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   and no internet,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.440]   no TV,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.100]   no nothing.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.400]   Oh,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.180]   you slept there?
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.440]   Yeah,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.960]   we slept there.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.720]   It was a three,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.420]   two nights,
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.080]   three day retreat.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   Reading retreat.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.400]   Reading retreat.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.620]   And then we just,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.140]   he said,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.480]   okay,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.140]   we're all going to our rooms,
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.320]   we'll meet for lunch,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.120]   we'll meet for dinner
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.920]   and then we hang out
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.320]   a little bit
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.940]   and boom,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.680]   and the next day.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.820]   So I said,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.020]   okay,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.740]   I'm going to read,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.780]   I'm going to read
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.400]   the epistles.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   So that,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.780]   that period,
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.000]   that reading retreat
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.920]   really changed my life
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.700]   because I remember
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.240]   before opening the Bible,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.220]   I said,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.680]   God,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.000]   I have this question
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.420]   about Christian life
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.620]   and I am going,
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.880]   whatever I find
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.640]   in these pages,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.580]   I am committing right now
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.220]   to align my entire future
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.260]   to that.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.200]   It was like a personal
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.820]   fork of the road.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.120]   So I said,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.700]   I am going to align my life
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.920]   and then after that prayer,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.320]   I was like,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.300]   I don't want to open this Bible
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.920]   because I was like scared.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.740]   what did I just say?
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.040]   I was like,
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.100]   oh my gosh,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.980]   this is going to change my life
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.640]   if I actually live accordingly.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.340]   So,
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.040]   so then that was,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.460]   yeah,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.200]   the start of it.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.600]   But then,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.780]   yeah,
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.600]   it got to a point
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.640]   where by the third day
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   I was like,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.020]   every page I was crying,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.400]   repenting,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.920]   praying,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.140]   turning the page,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.500]   crying,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.060]   repenting,
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.800]   praying about like
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.880]   my understanding
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.580]   of Christian life
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.160]   being so,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.440]   so long-anger.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:36.720]   Yeah,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.680]   against the Bible.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.860]   Wow.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.840]   Maybe that's what
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.720]   our retreat should be.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.060]   Kind of like sin.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.840]   lock you in a room
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.440]   and lock you in a room.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.380]   How do we teach people
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.860]   to do DT?
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.500]   Before you open that Bible,
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.560]   just commit to live
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.000]   whatever you're going to.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.300]   Yeah,
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.560]   what you'll find in these pages.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.640]   That's powerful.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.780]   That's very powerful.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.420]   We've got to bring
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:53.960]   some of that back.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.700]   All right.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.060]   Well,
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.620]   I don't know,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.120]   you don't have to have
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.000]   as dramatic a story.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.540]   Yeah,
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.540]   I just became a Christian
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.260]   and I think
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.320]   the mission trip
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.160]   right after that,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.440]   my summer after
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.280]   junior year
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.920]   was pivotal
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   to experiencing
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.940]   ministry
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.200]   and Christian life together
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.860]   Was it Japan?
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.980]   We went to Japan
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.480]   and Korea
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.800]   so it was a month long
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.260]   and we were together
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.060]   24-7
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.720]   and we did a lot
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.380]   of Bible study
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.280]   on Luke
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.800]   and I just remember
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.660]   feeling like
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.860]   this is what I was meant,
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.220]   my life was meant for.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.920]   I feel so joyful
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.660]   even though
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.600]   I don't have
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.800]   my private space.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.360]   I'm wearing the same thing
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.260]   everybody's wearing
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.400]   and just doing
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:33.880]   the same thing
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.640]   everyone's doing
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.280]   but yet
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.880]   I feel so much more joy
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.200]   so I just wanted
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.840]   to do that
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.780]   for the rest of my life.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.180]   And I think that was
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.660]   one of the things
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.460]   that stood out to me
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.400]   when I came to our church too
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.840]   was like,
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.060]   oh,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.360]   it's just like a mission trip
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.300]   24-7.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.400]   Wow,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.180]   that's cool!
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.160]   and I think that
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.960]   kind of explains a lot
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.940]   about who we are
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.780]   and what we do
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.020]   so,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.580]   yeah.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.580]   Wow.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.300]   24-7 mission trips
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.600]   I mean,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.420]   not that intense
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.020]   but trying to live that way
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.180]   even at home.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:04.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.020]   Well,
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.840]   speaking of mission trips
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.440]   maybe we can just
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:06.980]   talk about that.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.420]   Sure.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.280]   Or maybe before we talk
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.720]   about that
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.460]   we can talk about
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.740]   so how did you guys meet
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.140]   because junior year
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.000]   you notice him
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.720]   but you're like,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.180]   who's that guy?
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.700]   So how did you guys
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.360]   like,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.080]   how did you start dating?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.420]   Like,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.480]   what's the story about that?
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   She liked me first.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.360]   Is that true?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.140]   We have to figure it out
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.900]   kind of later.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.300]   Like,
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.940]   we have to sort of
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.120]   I didn't tell anybody
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.860]   but we had been serving
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.080]   in the same staff group
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.440]   for
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.700]   there was just one staff group
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.540]   and we served there
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.720]   for a few years
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.840]   and then
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.300]   actually a lot of my peers
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:40.840]   got married
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.780]   so there weren't
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.620]   that many options
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.940]   but
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:48.220]   I heard
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.320]   I heard you hung up on
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   well,
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.580]   yeah,
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.460]   I called her
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.300]   but you did ask her first?
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.040]   I did ask her
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.320]   yeah,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.580]   okay

[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:55.620]   yeah
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.860]   so then I was like
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.140]   okay,
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.860]   I'm interested
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.640]   I'm interested
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   so
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.040]   I called her
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.600]   were you nervous?
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.340]   I was nervous
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.780]   wow
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.720]   and I was like
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.160]   okay,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.640]   okay

[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:09.940]   hello
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.620]   and then
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.620]   small talk
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.660]   some small talk
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.040]   first
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.680]   how are you doing
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.640]   because you know
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.120]   this
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.240]   it's a phone
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.300]   it's a landline call
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.520]   so I'm like
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.880]   hey
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.760]   I was wondering
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.440]   if you wanted
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.360]   to go out with me
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   and it was like
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.800]   a very important
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.300]   like nerve-working question
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.780]   and then
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.480]   her answer
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.060]   was
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.860]   I guess
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.180]   I was really nervous
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.000]   because it's a landline
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.020]   so I'm in my apartment
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.320]   like hoping nobody's
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.200]   overhearing
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.940]   and then also
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.860]   I was excited
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.580]   but I didn't want to
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.480]   seem so excited
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.180]   so then what came out
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.660]   was I guess
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.320]   so I was like
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   I guess
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.000]   and then she goes
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.700]   I meant yes
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.080]   right
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.920]   but then
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.840]   I was like
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.980]   you know what
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.920]   why don't you think about it
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.240]   and just call me back
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.580]   when you're sure
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.380]   so that's
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.620]   I tell single guys
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.420]   don't grovel
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.500]   don't grovel
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:06.820]   wow
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.720]   was that like
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.960]   how did you feel about that?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   oh shoot
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.580]   no I can't call him
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.080]   right back
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.880]   so now I have to wait
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.860]   and meanwhile
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.180]   I'm like
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:18.860]   how come she's not calling
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.140]   what's going on here?
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.620]   oh my gosh
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.300]   how long did you wait?
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.860]   at least a day
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.620]   because yeah
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.280]   I couldn't call him
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.240]   back on the same day
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   that's too much
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.600]   that's too much
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.560]   how did that work
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.780]   with landlines back then?
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.700]   you just had to hope
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.240]   that the person
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.880]   you were trying to call
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.860]   and you know
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.580]   roommates would
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.260]   you know
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.880]   pick up another
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.620]   landline
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.600]   and then start listening
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.520]   oh that's wrong
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.120]   okay there we go
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.560]   that's wrong
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.060]   yeah
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.500]   that's wrong
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.140]   different times
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:45.480]   yeah
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.860]   that was very common
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.780]   you guys have any
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.880]   like fun

[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.300]   both of them
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.560]   that was the lobster
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   that was the anniversary

[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.200]   this is the first day
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.400]   that I'm meeting
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.520]   Sarah's parents
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.800]   and
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.560]   she told me that her
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.340]   dad is a giant
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.740]   like really really tall
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.960]   but he wasn't

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.040]   looking up
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.320]   tall for his generation
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   yeah
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.240]   but you're like 5'10
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.580]   right?

[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.920]   so then anyway
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.140]   we're meeting at this
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.880]   seafood restaurant
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.300]   yeah
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.400]   and I'm nervous
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.160]   and I'm like trying to
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.780]   make a good impression
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.820]   and shake his hand
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.400]   and we sit down
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.280]   across from each other
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.420]   and then we're making
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.900]   small talk
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.760]   and then food comes out
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.400]   it's fish flat
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:45.960]   it's like a fish
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.620]   you know seafood
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.580]   so then Sarah
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.660]   grabs a lemon
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.600]   I'm talking like this
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.520]   and she's next to me
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.220]   and she's
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.960]   you know how
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.380]   you're supposed
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.940]   to do this
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.300]   you're supposed
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.560]   to like cover it
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.980]   and do this
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.320]   and she goes
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.100]   like that
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.820]   and the lemon juice
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.040]   flies
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.340]   I was wearing glasses too
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.040]   it went
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.280]   right into my right eye
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.480]   like
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.880]   right perfectly
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.840]   into my right eye
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.800]   and I was like
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.520]   like this
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.680]   and I try to
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.140]   I was like
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.040]   trying to play it off
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.380]   for a moment
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.460]   I was trying to play it off
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.300]   but then my right eye
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:20.900]   was twitching
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.780]   and I started crying
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.640]   on my right eye
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:23.960]   right
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.340]   so I was like
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:25.620]   okay
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.420]   I could try to play it off
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.280]   and look really weird
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.760]   or I just
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.440]   I just decided
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.900]   to go for it
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.140]   I was like
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.140]   ow
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.940]   I just went
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.380]   ow
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:32.700]   Sarah
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.580]   you squeezed lemon
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.460]   into my eyeball
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.380]   I made it very clear
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.080]   to both of them
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.700]   what just happened
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.300]   so they would know
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.720]   what's going on
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.520]   so like me twitching
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.700]   makes sense
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.140]   you know
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.220]   and then you know
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.960]   Sarah's mom was like
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.660]   oh Sarah
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.140]   be careful
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.940]   you gotta be careful
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.760]   that was nice
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.920]   that was after
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.380]   you were married
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:55.720]   no
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.800]   that was when
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.200]   we were first meeting parents
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.020]   oh so lemon and lobster
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.680]   are not the same
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.460]   lobster was some lobster
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:01.860]   yeah
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.180]   I never had the lobster one
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.080]   lobster one
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   was like our anniversary
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.180]   and then we went to
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.120]   Spanger's
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.560]   you know
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:07.940]   seafood
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.760]   and then it was like
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.580]   a Monday I think
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.720]   and it was a lobster special
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.660]   basically I said
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.880]   I've never had lobster before
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.260]   so he said
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.140]   oh you should try it
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.260]   and so it came out
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.620]   I didn't know how to eat it
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.380]   it was pretty cheap
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.100]   so then I was like
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.820]   oh that's a good one
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.680]   that's special
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.200]   let's get it
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.280]   whole lobster
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:21.820]   and you know
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.740]   they had that
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.440]   lobster
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:23.740]   that
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.640]   what is that
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:24.940]   crack
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.600]   cracker thing
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:25.760]   yeah
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.340]   cracking
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.080]   the wrench
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.500]   the claw
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:27.900]   the claw
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.340]   so then you know
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.420]   the claw looks like this
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.780]   has a little claw
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.140]   and then
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.880]   you know
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.620]   you're supposed to
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.720]   turn the lobster
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.860]   cracker or the claw
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.620]   crack it
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.960]   crack it
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.460]   this way
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.360]   but she grabs it
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.120]   like this
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.640]   which already has
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.600]   a perfectly shaped
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.780]   just fit perfectly
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.900]   into that space
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.780]   and she's squeezing
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.380]   like this
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.340]   just adding pressure
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.940]   just consistent pressure
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.520]   on that claw
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.980]   and I'm like
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.500]   looking at this
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:56.780]   I'm like
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.040]   oh
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.540]   and I was about to tell
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.080]   Sarah
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   and then
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.740]   it popped
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.000]   and the whole claw
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.620]   exploded
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.280]   and it went on my glasses
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.220]   and it hit the person
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.320]   behind the table
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.560]   it went to several tables
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.300]   the big piece went
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.820]   and hit this gentleman's
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.040]   back on his head
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.060]   and it was a whole
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.960]   like a group of men
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.220]   right
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.680]   yeah a group of like
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.880]   older men
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.320]   and it went
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.480]   and then
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.600]   and then he just
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.420]   turned back
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.080]   and by this time
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.680]   Sarah was
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.700]   under the table
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.740]   she was hiding
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.120]   she was like
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.800]   oh my gosh
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.600]   and I turned back
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.200]   toward that gentleman
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.700]   with a piece of lobster
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.340]   on my glasses
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.120]   and I said
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.840]   I'm so sorry
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.940]   and he looked at me
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.240]   and I think he kind of knew
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.280]   what's going on
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.800]   and he was like
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.500]   it's alright
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.960]   so that was our
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.900]   just food
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.720]   yeah food
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.300]   food
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:47.900]   things
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.360]   unfortunately most dates
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.100]   involve food
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.880]   that's unfortunate
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   that's unfortunate
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.060]   wow
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.160]   well that was fun
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.900]   that was fun
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.460]   alright so
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.860]   changing gears a little bit
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.940]   we've changed gears here
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.220]   you guys recently
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   came back from
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.800]   Vietnam
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.160]   and we had
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.400]   multiple international
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.460]   like mission trips
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.020]   going on
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.740]   you guys led
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.940]   how many people
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.400]   were on the
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.440]   there were 30
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.340]   including us
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:11.940]   yeah
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.680]   to go support our team there
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.040]   and so we just wanted
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.840]   to just ask you
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.360]   a few questions
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.080]   about that
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.540]   let's just start off
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.360]   on the topic of food
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.420]   what's the best thing you eat
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.460]   there
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.380]   there were
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.760]   the Vietnamese food
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.320]   ban seo
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.860]   it's like a Vietnamese crepe
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:28.580]   that you wrap
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.360]   in lettuce
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.800]   yeah
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.620]   I mean they were really good
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.800]   Vietnamese food of course
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.660]   but what I was impressed
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.440]   mostly by

[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.860]   they even got to share
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.140]   because I liked it so much
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.560]   this is ban mi

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.620]   the egg
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.560]   it's the cheapest ban mi
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.060]   you can get
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.340]   which is just egg
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.740]   egg ban mi
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.520]   how much does it cost

[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.640]   wow
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.780]   so then
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.860]   everything's so cheap
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.940]   when I ate it
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.200]   because I just wanted to see
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.640]   I wanted to get to get
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.240]   the cheapest thing
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.400]   yeah
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.020]   ban mi

[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.800]   oh my gosh
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.740]   this is
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.500]   this is what ban mi
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.100]   is supposed to taste like
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:06.440]   really
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.460]   it's that different huh
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:07.900]   yeah
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.880]   I thought that was like
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.760]   bread of life shirt
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.120]   no
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.220]   it's ban mi
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.540]   ban mi shirt
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.800]   it's not a bread of life
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.020]   ban mi op la
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.440]   especially
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.020]   I like op
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.340]   yeah
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:15.800]   anyway
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.000]   wow
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.620]   wow
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.360]   what made it so good
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.860]   like what was
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.940]   the
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.140]   the radishes
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.940]   you know how it's like
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.360]   kind of
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.400]   very vinegary
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:23.720]   yeah
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.780]   I don't like those
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.320]   it's like
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.660]   slightly vinegary
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.220]   it's more subtle
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.380]   and the bread is softer
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.040]   it's crispy on the outside
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.060]   softer on the inside
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.000]   and then the egg
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.560]   it's like
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.000]   it's kind of runny
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.360]   yeah
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.180]   and that's what just
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.060]   the vinegar and the egg mixture
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.260]   it means people are very proud
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.900]   of their food
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.420]   and they do know how to
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.480]   flavor their food
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:45.840]   yeah
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.020]   I could see that being good
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.040]   I'm not a fan of
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.840]   I mean America
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.460]   but maybe
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:50.800]   yeah because then like
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.480]   the bread's so hard
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:51.820]   it feels like
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.500]   it's not hard at all
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:53.840]   but
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.440]   wow
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.220]   wow
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:55.860]   all right
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.580]   well
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.300]   yeah
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.220]   you guys are there
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.480]   leading the team
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.120]   and helping
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.180]   helping our team there
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.280]   I guess one thing
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.140]   we wanted to ask
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.460]   was just
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.780]   you know
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.640]   a lot of us
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.180]   have been praying
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.760]   for our teams
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.440]   and stuff like that
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.860]   and we try to think about
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.280]   like what's
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.100]   what's hard for them
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.700]   what's challenging
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.160]   to try and pray
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.800]   but what's one thing
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.160]   that like
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.440]   you're like
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.500]   I know that was hard
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.520]   but after I personally
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.400]   experienced it
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.200]   oh I can
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   I appreciate the challenge
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:19.840]   maybe
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.880]   in different ways
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.140]   like a challenge
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.200]   of like
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.240]   foreign mission life
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.900]   I guess
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.120]   does that
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.280]   make sense
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.300]   okay
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.880]   like
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.820]   just during that trip
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.420]   yeah
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.740]   that we observed
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.940]   for the team
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.240]   yeah
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.580]   I think the hardest
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.160]   thing is the language barrier
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.380]   and
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.520]   not being able to
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.920]   understand or speak
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.080]   the language
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.820]   and so
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.160]   but because of that
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.620]   you
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.400]   really are forced
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.960]   to
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.620]   communicate
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.640]   the essentials
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.380]   you know
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.720]   so
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.760]   I think
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.700]   like
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.100]   if
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.700]   you know
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.580]   in trying to
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.200]   share your testimony
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.100]   or your story
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.760]   or the gospel
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.720]   you have to like
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.460]   boil it down
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.680]   so like
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.420]   I guess
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:05.960]   that's the part
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.340]   that you
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:06.780]   kind of
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.280]   appreciate
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.100]   since you're
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.680]   like
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.420]   kind of handicapped
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.940]   in that way
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.420]   okay
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.780]   and Vietnamese language
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.240]   is like
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.020]   impossible
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.340]   it's so hard
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.340]   but there is actually
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.080]   one of the sisters
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.160]   that went
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.300]   and actually
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.420]   her Vietnamese
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.780]   got advanced
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.380]   to a point
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.720]   where
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.580]   at least vocab
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.500]   her vocab level
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.060]   was actually
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.900]   you know
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.120]   as a non-Vietnamese person
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.480]   yeah
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.900]   it was really high
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.520]   so is our team
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.360]   like able to
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.200]   converse in Vietnamese
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.400]   or not quite yet
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.680]   yeah
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.060]   it depends on the person
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.420]   yeah
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.780]   it's
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.860]   it's hard
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.220]   it's hard
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:40.520]   yeah
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.140]   so
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.740]   they kind of
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   especially like
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.760]   gospel conversation
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   or meaningful conversation
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.320]   it's just
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   they can't do that
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.020]   it's really hard
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.360]   so I imagine
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.060]   like most of
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.100]   what they're trying to do
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.980]   then is the English
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.380]   yeah
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.960]   but they have
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.660]   they can't speak
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.560]   Vietnamese enough
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.140]   to get by
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.600]   and kind of
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.380]   get around
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.200]   and things like that
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.100]   yeah
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.580]   so
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.080]   yeah
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   I think that's
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.580]   I think that's true
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.820]   the heat
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.380]   and everything like that
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.240]   it's
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.740]   actually it's pretty surprising
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.800]   I heard crossing the street
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.840]   oh yeah
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.040]   that's scary
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.700]   crossing the street
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.620]   crossing the street
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.000]   that's the most
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.600]   that's the biggest
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.520]   culture shock
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.480]   in Vietnam
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.880]   yeah
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.760]   in Ho Chi Minh City
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.000]   well it's like
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.960]   no they do
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.440]   but there's
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.400]   oncoming traffic
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.440]   like coming straight
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.880]   at you
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.440]   and you just
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.580]   you just have to
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.640]   go straight
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.320]   you don't
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.020]   no not frog
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.700]   you don't stop
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.540]   you never stop
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.080]   oh
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.600]   you have to maintain
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.480]   you have to maintain
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:30.920]   a constant
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.440]   because they'll just
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.060]   go around you
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.380]   and you trust that
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:32.960]   they'll go around you
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.240]   yeah
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.860]   wow
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.800]   it's like fish
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   they do
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.640]   fish don't stop
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.380]   you know
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.160]   there's big fish
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.980]   which is the trucks
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.900]   and the cars
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.820]   and the small fishes
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.480]   are motos
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.220]   and everybody's just flowing
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.980]   and we just
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:44.800]   we just flow
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.920]   that sounds really efficient
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.780]   it's like Indiana Jones
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.640]   it is efficient
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.280]   it's amazing
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.880]   it's efficient
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.720]   but really scary
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.820]   because like
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.040]   I'm looking at a situation
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.440]   I'm going
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.060]   how is this not a gridlock
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.860]   in America
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.400]   it would be like
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.740]   a three hour gridlock
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.560]   but they just
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.300]   they keep moving
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:58.760]   wow
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.280]   so
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.760]   that was cool
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.300]   what was some of the
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   what are some of the
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:04.720]   neatest things
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.420]   you guys got to try
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.240]   while you were there
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.220]   and then help the team
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.400]   with
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.920]   like ministry wise
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.900]   ministry wise
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.440]   oh boy
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:10.980]   it's like
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.800]   well we got to do
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.180]   some
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.740]   pretty awesome things
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.480]   well
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.580]   there's
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.160]   you want to talk
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.860]   about the youth event
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.400]   that was probably
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.260]   the neatest thing
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.500]   that we got to put on
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.240]   basically like
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.020]   a production
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.780]   X2 Live
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.460]   production
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.900]   gospel skit
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.700]   songs
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.280]   and testimonies
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.460]   with youth
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.500]   is that the first time
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:35.880]   X2 Live
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.800]   went international
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.320]   kind of
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.340]   I think we did
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:38.920]   something like that
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.360]   in Taiwan
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.900]   maybe
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.780]   oh yeah
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.340]   I think so
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.980]   but
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.240]   like
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.160]   in Vietnam
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.020]   with youth
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.780]   who speak English
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.380]   so they did
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:46.840]   the whole thing
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.280]   in English
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.100]   with like
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.920]   Vietnamese subtitles
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.000]   and just
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.440]   seeing the youth's
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.800]   passion and desire
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.720]   to share the gospel
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   was really neat
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.680]   they invited their
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.200]   friends
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.480]   and
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.980]   family
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.340]   people
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.860]   also they like
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.520]   listened to all
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.320]   of our direction
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.500]   and they were
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.420]   willing to act
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.000]   you know
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.580]   even though
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.100]   it's not even
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.480]   in their language
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.980]   how do we know
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.560]   these youth
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.000]   yeah
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.420]   we know
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.340]   we have a connection
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.480]   through someone
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.120]   to a
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.340]   like a bunch
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.920]   of schools
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.620]   that are
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.520]   English speaking
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:15.980]   schools
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.660]   but not Christian
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.000]   schools
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.540]   they are
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.000]   they're private
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.280]   schools
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.040]   but yeah
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.860]   they're private
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.400]   schools
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.320]   or learning centers
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.700]   and it's all
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.240]   in English
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.860]   like when you're
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.300]   there you have
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:27.840]   to speak English
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.420]   so they all
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.080]   they're native
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.400]   Vietnamese
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.060]   but they learn
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.540]   English
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.380]   and so some
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.820]   of them speak
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.460]   really well
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.000]   like almost
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.760]   like an American
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.360]   and some of
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:34.860]   them are not
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.240]   so well
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.920]   but they all
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.800]   they all try
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.040]   and they were
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.320]   in need of
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.980]   like a youth
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.420]   group kind
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:38.780]   of thing
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.340]   yeah
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.680]   so then
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.100]   our team
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.560]   has started
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.440]   doing monthly
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.560]   youth events
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.000]   and then
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.740]   one of their
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.140]   events was
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.680]   dare to share
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.560]   and after that
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.180]   they decided
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:47.760]   oh since we
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.560]   can't go out
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.200]   yeah they can't
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.860]   actually do
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.100]   go out and share
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.020]   because we'll do
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.620]   this instead
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.780]   and then they
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.680]   invite their friends
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.540]   into a theater
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.180]   and they will
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.620]   share the gospel
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.880]   so it was precipitated
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.780]   by dare to share
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.400]   yeah
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.200]   that's really neat
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.100]   that's where the idea
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.140]   that they got the idea
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.320]   and these youth kids
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.340]   I mean it seems like
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.240]   most of them don't
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.920]   come from Christian
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.280]   backgrounds
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.200]   or do they
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.880]   what's kind of
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.700]   the breakdown there
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.420]   I would
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.840]   I don't
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.520]   I'm not sure
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.420]   but I know that
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.980]   for many of them
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.280]   like their parents
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.420]   and their extended
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.040]   family that they're
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.400]   inviting
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.520]   they're not Christians
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:19.880]   yeah
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.280]   and they
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.240]   some of them
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.360]   their parents
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.860]   didn't know that
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.580]   their children
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.400]   had turned Christian
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.680]   but they knew
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.480]   through the school
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.240]   or through the camp
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:31.880]   yeah
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.480]   so then
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   it was their
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.280]   like
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.440]   kind of
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:35.820]   they had to
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.520]   kind of
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.620]   shore up their courage
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.080]   to go
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.440]   okay
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.620]   I might
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.900]   get a talking to
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.900]   after this
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.040]   but here
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.700]   I'm going to
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.300]   proclaim the gospel
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:44.980]   to my parents
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.420]   yeah
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.540]   how does that
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.380]   do we have any word
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.080]   about how that's been
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.480]   because I remember
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.260]   hearing about that
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.660]   that like
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:49.820]   yeah
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.160]   this is
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.240]   they're taking this step
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.480]   but
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.860]   was there any fallout
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.400]   or like
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.560]   I haven't heard
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.340]   any fallout yet
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.360]   I haven't heard about fallout
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.760]   yeah
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.300]   seems like they're still excited
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.520]   okay so far
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.940]   okay
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.860]   that's good news
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:01.400]   because you just
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.180]   have to see your kid
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:02.600]   in a play
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:02.980]   yeah
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.660]   I guess so
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:03.960]   yeah
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.700]   so it was really neat
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.020]   that happened
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.580]   and then
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.500]   there was also
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.620]   a lot of college
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.880]   campus outreach
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.820]   that was kind of neat
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.100]   so
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.820]   we
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.080]   instead of like
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.060]   doing DC outreach
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.540]   which is
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.180]   what people have been trying
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.500]   yeah
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.340]   decided okay
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.360]   since there's a whole group
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.000]   of people coming
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.580]   let's try
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.300]   just walking through
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:21.800]   the front door
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.660]   and going to the administrators
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.200]   and go hey
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.280]   we have a bunch of people coming
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.140]   so we're gonna
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.900]   we're gonna do a cultural exchange
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.300]   and
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.800]   and it's all in English
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.380]   so we told them
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.100]   we're not gonna provide even Vietnamese
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:34.820]   like translations
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.480]   it's all English
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.340]   so then the school
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.840]   getting excited about
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.480]   a bunch of people
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.140]   doing workshops
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.740]   like about
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.860]   college life
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.160]   yeah
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.340]   from America
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.920]   they got together
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.640]   and they kind of
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.820]   filtered out for us
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.820]   and filtered
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.580]   and got together
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.660]   the best English speakers
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.340]   and said hey
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.860]   here we are
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.820]   and like there's 70 of us
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.520]   wow so they were
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.260]   super supportive
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:54.660]   wow
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.760]   they were very supportive
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.060]   so
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.400]   wow
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.540]   in a communist country
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:57.920]   that's great
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.880]   that's awesome
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.560]   how are like the
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.880]   what are Vietnamese
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.920]   college students like
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.220]   like
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.380]   what are similarities
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:05.920]   and differences
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.300]   from American college ministry
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   that you saw
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.820]   well when I described
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.900]   the American college students
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.680]   kind of busy schedule
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.860]   and clubs
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.160]   and things like that
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.420]   they
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.580]   the college students there
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.800]   resonated with that a lot
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.360]   they said oh
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.120]   it's just like that
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.820]   for us here
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.440]   you know
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Vietnam is
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.020]   developing really fast
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.600]   and so
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:26.960]   there
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.920]   I think there is
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.220]   that competitive environment
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.940]   and some people
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.180]   like when we invited people
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.220]   over for open homes
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.620]   some of the
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.660]   especially girls
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.560]   would say
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.460]   oh I'm really stressed
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.680]   I'm drowning right now
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.420]   you know
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:38.900]   with
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.880]   school tests
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.160]   and
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.460]   one big difference
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.280]   is the schedule
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.040]   you want to talk about
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.520]   the schedule
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.920]   it's very different
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.480]   well that
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.160]   and the way
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.420]   the classes get cancelled
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:50.940]   oh yeah
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.820]   I mean the professors
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   just cancel
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.940]   they have a lot of authority
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.200]   well the professors
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.100]   just decide to cancel
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.140]   for no apparent reason
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.480]   sometimes
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.600]   I just don't feel
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.040]   like teaching
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.400]   and they will reschedule
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.100]   it like to Saturday
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.460]   morning
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.920]   or Friday night
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   oh what the
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.180]   and you have to show up
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.460]   yeah
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.060]   wow
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:07.860]   so then
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.400]   they were like
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.160]   oh yeah
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.740]   I can't
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.460]   because my professors
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.220]   just rescheduled
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.920]   my class
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.440]   to Saturday
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.760]   and I
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.360]   that would not fly
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:13.760]   in the stage
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   so that's very different
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.940]   wow
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.980]   I wonder why they're stressed
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.420]   yeah
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.880]   that is stressful
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.400]   that makes me thankful
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.540]   from my college experience
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.060]   I was just gonna do that
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.700]   yeah so it's
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.540]   their schedule
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.140]   is unpredictable
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.100]   in a way
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.600]   well but the similarities
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.040]   well they're very warm
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.740]   we found the students
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.440]   very warm
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.280]   and really open
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.880]   to talking
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.960]   about ideas
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.280]   I think there's
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.400]   just generally
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.820]   a hospitality culture
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.080]   that's kind of built in
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.440]   so then for example
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.700]   like when we were
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.380]   at the cafeteria
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.080]   school cafeteria
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.160]   and we can't read
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.920]   we don't know
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.460]   what to order
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.220]   pretty much
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.180]   every person
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.820]   that we sort of
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.720]   flagged down
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.440]   to help us
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.580]   would stick with us
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.420]   it's not just like
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:52.820]   oh I'm busy
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.040]   or here it is
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.020]   and they would go
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.500]   okay I'll order for you
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.780]   and they would just
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.700]   stick with us
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.260]   for like sometimes
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.260]   the first girl
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:00.840]   that I met
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   bought me a drink
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.340]   yeah she was really nice
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.380]   and ate with us
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:07.680]   wow
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.300]   so they're very warm
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.640]   yeah
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.420]   and is that like
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.340]   a college student specific
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.840]   or is it just
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.800]   Vietnam in general
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.580]   they're like hospital
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.680]   I don't know
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.920]   well one guy said
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.780]   you know in Vietnam
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.380]   you know
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.200]   I talked to you once
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.020]   I talked to you twice
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.760]   twice I'm best friend
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.340]   so I'm like oh
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:23.960]   that's great
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.940]   yeah but I mean
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.840]   in terms of like
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.660]   how college students
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.940]   are open to ideas
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.580]   and thinking about
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.140]   their future
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.100]   they're like that
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.600]   I feel like
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.360]   they're actually
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.120]   more open
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.420]   more open
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.840]   than typical
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.240]   American college students
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.200]   yeah
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.260]   and they spent
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.780]   a lot of time
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.220]   with us
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.040]   if they came
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.720]   to our events
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.620]   they would talk
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.380]   for a long time
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.700]   wow
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.420]   I mean it's probably
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.440]   a really special
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.060]   opportunity for them
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.340]   too
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:49.980]   to talk with
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.500]   Americans
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:50.880]   yeah
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.860]   so yeah
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.180]   what were some
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.600]   of the like
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.220]   bright spots
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.440]   from some of those
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.040]   things you guys did
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.420]   like
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.680]   highlights
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.120]   yeah
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:00.540]   highlights
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.280]   stories
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.120]   yeah
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.280]   I mean
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.000]   well
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.220]   the celebration
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.320]   of the youth
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.240]   after their event
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.020]   like just seeing
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.320]   them so joyful
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.940]   like
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.820]   these guys
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.560]   were like
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.460]   hugging each other
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.220]   on stage
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.780]   for a long time
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.680]   and taking pictures
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.020]   and then
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.720]   hearing stories
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.400]   about how they
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   some of them
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.200]   used to be so dark
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.860]   but through
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.760]   the youth groups
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.380]   they've been
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.700]   frightening up so much
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.460]   one of the
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.400]   one of the people
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.040]   that were
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.660]   the partners
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.260]   that we're working
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:29.640]   with
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.220]   she was like
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.660]   tearing up
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.100]   and crying
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.660]   because she goes
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.420]   that person
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:34.680]   that
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.840]   he was so dark
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.800]   it was so
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.100]   and
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.140]   there have been
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.420]   I mean
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.220]   they've been telling us
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.040]   that there's been
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.360]   like
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.420]   increase in youth
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.080]   suicides
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.000]   just
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.500]   just
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.220]   the darkness
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.000]   of the youth
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.560]   what they're going through
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.040]   and especially
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.800]   the high pressure
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.220]   as money is now
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.220]   becoming a real thing
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:54.840]   like oh wow
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.760]   you can make it big
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.700]   everybody's trying
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.480]   to shoot for money
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.640]   and there's a lot
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.140]   of pressure
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.160]   for youth
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.740]   to do well
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.220]   in school
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.800]   and all that
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.140]   so
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.040]   so then
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.060]   so then
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.500]   when they saw that
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:05.940]   and they said
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.280]   this
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.300]   like
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   I can't believe
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.280]   how bright they are
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:09.620]   look how
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.180]   you know
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.320]   happy they are
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.400]   yeah
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.820]   and they did
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.520]   they actually
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.260]   part of the
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.300]   performance
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.140]   was the one
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.180]   one word description
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.560]   of before and after Christ
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.460]   before Christ
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.880]   and they flipped it
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.060]   and oh man
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.860]   that was powerful
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.140]   yeah
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.680]   so they
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.800]   kind of described it
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.020]   too
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.620]   and shared
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.560]   man
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.100]   yeah
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.200]   that's kind of the
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.080]   like any time
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.120]   a country's like ascending
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.740]   there's always that
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.080]   darker
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.060]   edge to it
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.920]   yeah
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.420]   wow
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.700]   we're glad our team
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.000]   is there
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.900]   yeah
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.520]   so what do you guys
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:40.980]   think about
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.480]   I don't know
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.360]   future of Christianity
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.840]   in Vietnam
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.620]   and I guess maybe
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.880]   also like
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.680]   I mean every
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.260]   every group
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.720]   you know
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.360]   every missions group
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:48.860]   is going to bring
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.340]   something like
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:49.800]   slightly different
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.360]   to the table
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.740]   like
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.680]   is there any way
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.300]   in which you feel
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.060]   like our church
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.840]   has like a
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.180]   particular angle
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.120]   that we can
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:56.600]   I don't know
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.400]   offer the people
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:57.800]   of Vietnam
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.780]   or kind of
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.300]   as a church
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.800]   like what
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.620]   yeah
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.540]   any thoughts
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:01.820]   on that
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.500]   did like
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.020]   the mission team
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.640]   have any thoughts
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.680]   well I think
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.560]   and I think
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.900]   the mission team
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.740]   also thinks
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.140]   that
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.420]   Vietnam
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.240]   is
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.480]   kind of at the
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.460]   brink
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.360]   of some sort
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.000]   of spiritual
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.860]   revival
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.580]   I think it's
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.860]   kind of
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.180]   they're sort
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:19.780]   of primed
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.200]   for it
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.760]   in a way
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.840]   just
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.700]   the openness
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.820]   to foreign
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.600]   ideas even
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.080]   as they
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.620]   experience
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.400]   some of the
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.920]   investment
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.580]   foreign investments
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.020]   coming in
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.420]   they're like
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.360]   not enforcing
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:32.900]   this whole
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.220]   like
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:33.980]   we're a
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.260]   communist
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:34.680]   country
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.100]   and we're
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:35.500]   not gonna
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.380]   allow foreign
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.080]   ideas to come
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.180]   in
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:37.520]   they're just
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:37.680]   kind of
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.120]   open
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.300]   so there's
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.680]   that
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.240]   and
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.300]   I don't know
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.020]   maybe this is
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.460]   anecdotal
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   but I've seen
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:43.860]   a lot of
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.420]   even Vietnamese
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:44.940]   American
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.160]   churches
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.320]   go through
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:47.900]   a revival
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.700]   in the Bay Area
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.000]   maybe
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.560]   maybe that's
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.060]   just kind of
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.620]   anecdotal
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.600]   to Bay Area
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:52.920]   but
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.880]   like if you
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.240]   look at
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.940]   the thriving
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.540]   church youth
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:56.920]   groups
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.860]   even like
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.760]   it's often
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.180]   Vietnamese
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.860]   American churches
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.240]   so
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.280]   I don't know
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.820]   there's something
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.560]   happening
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.140]   with the
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:04.980]   Vietnamese peoples
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.000]   yeah
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.780]   so I feel
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.280]   really hopeful
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.860]   about that
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.640]   that God
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.200]   might be doing
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.600]   something
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.860]   in the people
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.560]   not only
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.400]   in the country
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:12.720]   of Vietnam
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   but the people
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.020]   group of Vietnam
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.640]   to somehow
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.180]   make them
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.640]   open
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.760]   for the gospel
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.100]   so
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:18.860]   yeah
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.340]   and maybe
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:19.740]   it's not
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.540]   unique to Vietnam
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.240]   but I think
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.600]   people there
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.200]   are still
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:23.940]   interested in
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.720]   learning English
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.180]   and in
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.580]   the ideas
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.380]   that we
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.120]   you know
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.860]   can exchange
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.520]   with each other
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.960]   and so I think
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.900]   that's something
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.800]   that sort of
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.780]   that makes
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.140]   the country
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.660]   open
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.320]   to
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.540]   the gospel
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.680]   when you
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.180]   say open
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.000]   is it like
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.800]   they're like
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.200]   oh I've never
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:42.860]   heard this before
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.260]   this is kind
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.560]   of interesting
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.020]   or is it more
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.100]   like oh I've
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.480]   been thinking
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.060]   about this
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.620]   and finally
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.000]   I've got to
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.520]   kind of talk
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:47.820]   to someone
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.180]   about it
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:48.980]   I think it's both
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.520]   it's both
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.620]   we've heard both
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.320]   types of responses
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.080]   people are going
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.300]   this is what
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.520]   I've been wanting
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.300]   to talk about
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.600]   this is my first
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.000]   time that I'm
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.600]   talking about it
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:58.780]   though
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.780]   I've been
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.360]   thinking about
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.140]   this for a long
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.620]   time
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.660]   you know
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.400]   things like that
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:03.800]   I guess
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.620]   because you shared
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.100]   with me earlier
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.040]   about the dust
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.780]   particles song
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.120]   there's something
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.380]   about that
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.080]   so apparently
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.780]   it's a folk song
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.220]   yeah apparently
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:11.840]   like every
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.000]   you can explain
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.220]   so
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.600]   one of the
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.180]   playbooks that
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:17.700]   we play
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.300]   on foreign
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.960]   mission trips
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   that I've done
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.020]   before at Taiwan
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.740]   also is
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.800]   we show the
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.440]   race of a lifetime
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:24.740]   skit
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.900]   and then
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.020]   there's an
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.520]   Ecclesiastes
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.940]   passage
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.700]   but then I also
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.580]   pick a
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.380]   traditional song
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.100]   from that country
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.300]   that actually
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.240]   everybody knows
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.260]   that expresses
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.100]   the same feeling
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.040]   of vanity
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.680]   of chasing
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.280]   after the wind
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   there's always
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:39.700]   something
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.940]   so then
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.920]   and then
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.380]   so then I
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:42.620]   picked
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.680]   I found one
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.260]   and then
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.520]   I checked it
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.540]   everybody knows
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.020]   it was oh yeah
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:47.600]   everybody knows
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:47.920]   that one
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.860]   and then it's
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.140]   called
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.800]   that's called
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.620]   dust particles
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.000]   I don't know
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.020]   if I'm pronouncing
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.360]   it right
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.860]   why is it called
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.340]   dust particles
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:57.760]   it's about
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.940]   dust to dust
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.680]   if dust
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.460]   I go back
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.000]   to dust
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.180]   then the whole
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.120]   chase is exhausting
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.600]   very biblical
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:04.920]   huh
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.520]   yeah
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.060]   so then
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.920]   everybody knew that
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.660]   so then I kind of
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.080]   quoted it
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:09.520]   sort of like
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.320]   modeling after
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.380]   when Apostle Paul
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.680]   kind of quoted
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.960]   a poet
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.240]   so then
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.900]   we talk about
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.440]   you know
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.080]   I have the
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.600]   American culture
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.200]   you have a
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.820]   Vietnamese culture
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.360]   but really
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.040]   what we share
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.460]   is a human
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:25.860]   culture
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.360]   a human
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.120]   condition
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.820]   wow
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.280]   and then
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:28.720]   so that's
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.260]   the launching
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.100]   path to a
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.500]   discussion
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:30.840]   and then
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.200]   they're like
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.720]   this is
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.260]   I've been
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.760]   thinking about
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.060]   this
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.880]   why am I
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.360]   doing this
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:35.740]   why
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.040]   you know
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.260]   so
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.060]   yeah
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.340]   those
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.120]   I think
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.020]   people say
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.620]   that as well
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:39.960]   as like
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.500]   this is new
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.160]   yeah
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   wow
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.500]   well I think
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.120]   it's pretty amazing
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.640]   just like
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.420]   you know
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:46.780]   we
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.360]   set up
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:47.980]   these teams
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.300]   and
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.060]   just
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:50.820]   being able
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.160]   to hear
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:51.440]   all the
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:51.940]   updates
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.200]   from
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:53.760]   you know
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.080]   just
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.320]   different emails
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:55.780]   and stuff like
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.040]   that
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.420]   and then
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.120]   some of my own
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.380]   team
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.080]   people went
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.520]   on the
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.160]   mission trip
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.440]   you know
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.800]   and they brought
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.460]   back stories
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:00.900]   and stuff
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.220]   so
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.820]   it's really
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.300]   exciting to see
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.680]   what God
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.360]   has in store
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   you know
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:03.840]   yeah
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.120]   and it just
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.400]   seems like
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:04.780]   we came
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.320]   at a good
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.760]   time
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.060]   yeah
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.020]   so
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.760]   really thankful
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.260]   and I think
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.560]   I feel
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.140]   like
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.320]   more motivated
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.800]   to pray
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.320]   and have a better
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:14.740]   idea of how
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.060]   to pray
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.420]   so
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.980]   yeah
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.380]   is there anything
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.060]   else you want to know
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.360]   what would you say
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:19.980]   to our church
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.580]   about Vietnam
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.140]   like
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.480]   what's your
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.960]   what's your
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.700]   rallying cry
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.680]   do we need to
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.460]   send more people
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.200]   Vietnam
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.460]   gotta go
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.880]   I mean
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.080]   I think it is
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.400]   this is the time
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.960]   we don't know
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.840]   how long
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.080]   this window
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.920]   will last
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.960]   in a way
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.220]   this
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.780]   yeah
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.060]   they're very open
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.940]   and
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.300]   we can do stuff
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:42.620]   actually
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.000]   it's not
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.600]   that's the
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.980]   surprising thing
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.880]   it's freer
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.240]   than we thought
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.180]   it's a lot freer
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.600]   than we thought
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:49.800]   I mean
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.680]   I know that Hanoi
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.580]   we have to be careful
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.840]   still like the northern area
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.160]   but in the southern area
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.660]   it's kind of
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.220]   it's fine
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.820]   so
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   all right
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.160]   well thank you guys so much
