[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   However you cook in a high end professional kitchen does not translate
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.260]   whatsoever in a home kitchen.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.560]   I jokingly say it's like learning how to drive an F1 race car.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's the same thing as a car as a Prius, but very, very, very different.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.520]   And as crazy as it sounds, I do think it's somewhat applicable because how I
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   would drive a race car is very different than I would drive at home.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.620]   And a lot of things are just sort of unnecessary.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.380]   And so much of professional cooking is about volume, exquisite knife cuts,
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.480]   getting specific kinds of ingredients.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.120]   They're just really not at all useful for the home cook.
