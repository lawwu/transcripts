[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   We have a question here from Pal, who asks,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.320]   "How do you find the balance between physical and digital in productivity?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.680]   What is the line that pushes a task or process to be physical or digital?"
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.320]   Well, Pal, for me, when I think about physical artifacts,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.800]   so let's say a really good notebook and pen, for example,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.600]   I tend to think about these being appropriate for contemplative activities,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.040]   activities that are going to benefit from slowing down
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.880]   and giving something careful, reflective thought.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.160]   On the other hand, when I think of digital tools involved with the organization of my life,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.840]   I think of efficiency as what's at play here.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.720]   Okay, I've got a tool where I can capture everything and move things around
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.120]   and get information in there so I can minimize the time I waste
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.160]   on that type of organization so I can spend more time actually executing.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.400]   So typically, most of my tools, most of my tools in my workday are digital.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.160]   That's where I keep track of my calendar and where I have my task boards.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.480]   And I write out my quarterly plans are stored in digital documents,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   but then I shift to paper for my daily time block plan,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.000]   because as I'm going through my day, there are going to be points where I want to slow down.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680]   I'm trying to think something through.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.800]   I'm trying to understand a book chapter,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.440]   and I want to be away from efficiency and towards contemplative.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.200]   So I go towards a physical artifact.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.640]   I'm also big on these physical analog artifacts for non-professional reflection and planning.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.840]   So this is why I use a paper moleskin notebook to keep track of ideas about living a deeper life.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   It's the right modality for that.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.960]   That's a contemplative question.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.280]   That's a question that's going to be serviced by time.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.960]   This can be serviced by slowing down.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.080]   The same way that would be serviced by slowing down.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.400]   I wouldn't want to use a physical notebook, let's say, to keep track of all my tasks,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   because often when I'm trying to get to my task and figure out what I should be
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   working on in this 30-minute window I have free, I don't want to be slowing down.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.720]   I don't want to be flipping through pages.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.520]   I don't want to be recopying tasks from one page to another.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   I want that to be as fast as possible.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   I want efficiency.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.760]   So that's how I balance it when it comes to efficiency digital.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.440]   When it comes to highlighting contemplativeness, I'll go with the analog artifact.
