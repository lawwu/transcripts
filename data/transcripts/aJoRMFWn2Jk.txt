[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.400]   and new materials and new methods of heat extraction
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.240]   and so forth?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.640]   Because everybody knew fusion was 40 years away.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.020]   And now it's four years away.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.940]   - The following is a conversation with Dennis White,
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.840]   nuclear physicist at MIT and the director
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.280]   of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.360]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.120]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.560]   in the description.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Dennis White.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.780]   Let's start with a big question.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.320]   What is nuclear fusion?
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.600]   - It's the underlying process that powers the universe.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.640]   So as the name implies, it fuses together
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.120]   or brings together two different elements,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.100]   technically nuclei, that come together.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900]   And if you can push them together close enough
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.000]   that you can trigger essentially a reaction,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.960]   what happens is that the element typically changes.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   So this means that you change from one element
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.160]   to another, chemical element to another.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.200]   Underlying what this means is that you change
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.600]   the nuclear structure.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.040]   This rearrangement through equals MC squared
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.120]   releases large amounts of energy.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.320]   So fusion is the fusing together of lighter elements
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.140]   into heavier elements.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.440]   And when you go through it, you say, oh, look,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.080]   so here were the initial elements, typically hydrogen.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.440]   And they had a particular mass, rest mass,
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.400]   which means just the mass with no kinetic energy.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.560]   And when you look at the product afterwards,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   it has less rest mass.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.160]   And so you go, well, how is that possible?
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.600]   Because you have to keep mass,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780]   but mass and energy are the same thing,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.360]   which is what E equals MC squared means.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.140]   And the conversion of this comes into kinetic energy,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.840]   namely energy that you can use in some way.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.440]   And that's what happens in the center of stars.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.720]   So fusion is literally the reason life
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.560]   is viable in the universe.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.280]   - So fusion is happening in our sun.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.720]   And what are the elements?
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.440]   - The elements are hydrogen that are coming together.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.400]   It goes through a process which is probably,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.280]   it's a little bit too detailed,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   but it's a somewhat complex catalyzed process
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.440]   that happens in the center of stars.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.360]   But in the end, stars are big balls of hydrogen,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   which is the lightest, that's the simplest element,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.600]   the lightest element, the most abundant element,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   most of the universe is hydrogen.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   And it's essentially a sequence through which
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.700]   these processes occur that you end up with helium.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.000]   So those are the primary things.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.120]   And the reason for this is because helium
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.760]   has features as a nucleus,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.100]   like the interior part of the atom,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.480]   that is extremely stable.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.500]   And the reason for this is helium has two protons
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.840]   and two neutrons.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.240]   These are the things that make up nuclei,
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   that make up all of us, along with electrons.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.200]   And because it has two pairs, it's extremely stable.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   And for this reason, when you convert the hydrogen
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440]   into helium, it just wants to stay helium,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.820]   and it wants to release kinetic energy.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.080]   So stars are basically conversion engines
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.280]   of hydrogen into helium.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.160]   And this also tells you why you love fusion.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.000]   I mean, 'cause our sun will last 10 billion years,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.880]   approximately, that's how long the fuel will last.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.400]   - But to do that kind of conversion,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   you have to have extremely high temperatures.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.880]   - It is one of the criteria for doing this.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   But it's the easiest one to understand.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   Why is this?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.560]   It's because effectively what this requires
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.680]   is that these hydrogen ions,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.280]   which is really the bare nucleus,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.720]   so they have a positive charge,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   everything has a positive charge of those ones,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.800]   is that to get them to trigger this reaction,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.480]   they must approach within distances
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.920]   which are like the size of the nucleus itself.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.840]   Because the nature, in fact, what it's really using
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.800]   is something called the strong nuclear force.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.960]   There's four fundamental forces in the universe.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.760]   This is the strongest one.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.240]   But it has a strange property,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.020]   is that while it's the strongest force by far,
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.620]   it only has impact over distances
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.360]   which are the size of a nucleus.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.180]   So to get, let's put that into, what does that mean?
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.040]   It's a millionth of a billionth of a meter.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   Okay, incredibly small distances.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   But because the distances are small
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.560]   and the particles have charge,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.640]   they want to push strongly apart.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.560]   Namely, they have repulsion that wants to push them apart.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.160]   So it turns out when you go through the math of this,
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.480]   the average velocity or energy of the particles
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.500]   must be very high to have any significant probability
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.240]   of the reactions happening.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.000]   And so the center of our sun
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.940]   is at about 20 million degrees Celsius.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.360]   And on Earth, this means it's one of the first things
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.600]   we teach entering graduate students.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   You can do a quick, basically power balance
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   and you can determine that on Earth
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.760]   it requires a minimum temperature
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.200]   of about 50 million degrees Celsius on Earth.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.660]   - To perform fusion.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.420]   - To get enough fusion that you would be able to make,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.840]   get energy gain out of it.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.360]   So you can trigger fusion reactions at lower energy,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.920]   but they become almost vanishingly small
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.200]   at lower temperatures than that.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.320]   - First of all, let me just link around some crazy ideas.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.920]   So one, the strong force,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.360]   just stepping out and looking at all the physics.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   Is it weird to you that there's these forces
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.840]   and they're very particular,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   like it operates at a very small distance
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.880]   and then gravity operates at a very large distance
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   and they're all very specific
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.800]   and the standard model describes
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.000]   three of those forces extremely well and there's--
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.400]   - And this is one of them.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.240]   - Yeah, this is one of them.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.720]   And it's just all kind of works out.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   There's a big part of you that's an engineer.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.880]   Did you step back and almost look
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.920]   at the philosophy of physics?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.160]   - So it's interesting 'cause as a scientist,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.320]   I see the universe through that lens of essentially
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.640]   the interesting things that we do are through the forces
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.880]   that get used around those.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.660]   And everything works because of that.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.920]   Richard Feynman had, I don't know if you ever read
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.800]   Richard Feynman, it's a little bit of a tangent,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.680]   but-- - He's never been
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.600]   on the podcast. - He's never been
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.440]   on the podcast.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.760]   He was unfortunately passed away,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.320]   but like a hero to almost all physicists.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   And a part of it was because of what you said.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.000]   He kind of looked through a different lens
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.520]   at these, what typically look like very dry equations
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   and relationships and he kind of,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.880]   I think he brought out the wonder of it in some sense,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.520]   right, for those.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.880]   He posited what would be, if you could write down
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.480]   a single, not even really a sentence,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.280]   but a single concept that was the most important thing
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.520]   scientifically that we knew about.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.480]   That in other words, you had only one thing
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   that you could transmit like a future or past generation.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.120]   It was very interesting.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.240]   So it's not what you think.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.300]   It wasn't like, oh, strong nuclear force
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.480]   or fusion or something like this.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.520]   And it's very profound, which was that the reason
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.920]   that matter operates the way that it does
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.440]   is because all matter is made up of individual particles
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.920]   that interact each other through forces.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.760]   That was it.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.600]   So just...
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Atomic theory basically.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   Which is like, wow, that's like so simple,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.860]   but it's not so simple.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.560]   It's because like, who thinks about atoms
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.860]   that they're made out of?
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.860]   This is a good question I give to my students.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.300]   How many atoms are in your body?
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.040]   Like almost no students can answer this,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.000]   but to me, that's like a fundamental thing.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.040]   By the way, it's about 10 to the 28.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   10 to the 28.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   So that's a trillion, million, trillion, trillion,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.560]   or something like that, yes.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.360]   So one thing is to think about the number
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.520]   and the other is to start to really ponder the fact.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.600]   That it all holds together.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.800]   Yeah, it all holds together and you're actually that.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.840]   You're more that than you are anything else.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.400]   Yes, exactly, yeah.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.480]   No, I mean, there are people who do study such things
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.600]   of the fact that if you look at the, for example,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.560]   the ratios between those fundamental forces,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.400]   people have figured out, oh, if this ratio
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.880]   was different by some factor, like a factor of two
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.040]   or something, I was like, oh, this would all not work.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.120]   And you look at the sun, right?
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   So it turns out that there are key reactions
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.560]   that if they had slightly lower probability,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.200]   no star would ever ignite.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.880]   And then life wouldn't be possible.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.280]   It does seem like the universe set things up for us
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.140]   that it's possible to do some cool things,
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.680]   but it's challenging.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.980]   So that it keeps it fun for us.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.480]   Yeah, yeah, that's the way I look at it.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.360]   I mean, the multiverse model is an interesting one
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.800]   because there are quantum scientists who look at it
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.880]   and figure, it's like, oh, it's like, oh yeah.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.600]   Like quantum science perhaps tells us
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.760]   that there are almost an infinite variety
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.880]   of other universes, but the way that it works probably
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.080]   is it's almost like a form of natural selection.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.640]   It's like, well, the universes that didn't have
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.280]   the correct or interesting relationships
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.980]   between these forces, nothing happens in them.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.960]   So almost by definition, the fact that we're having
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.200]   this conversation means that we're in one
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.600]   of the interesting ones by default.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.080]   - Yeah, one of the somewhat interesting,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.880]   but there's probably super interesting ones
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.920]   where I tend to think of humans as incredible creatures.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.560]   Our brain is an incredible computing device,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.000]   but I think we're also extremely cognitively limited.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.320]   I can imagine alien civilizations that are much, much,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.180]   much, much more intelligent in ways we can't even comprehend
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.260]   in terms of their ability to construct models of the world,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.920]   to do physics, to do physics and mathematics.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.260]   - I would see it in a slightly different way.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.260]   It's actually, it's because we have creatures
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.220]   that live with us on the Earth that have cognition,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.780]   that understand and move through their environment,
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.060]   but they actually see things in a way,
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.540]   or they sense things in a way
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.580]   which is so fundamentally different, it's really hard.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.660]   It's the problem is the translation,
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.020]   not necessarily intelligence.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.460]   So it's the perception of the world.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.060]   So I have a dog, and when I go and I see my dog
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.340]   like smelling things, there's a realization that I have
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.820]   that he sees or senses the world in a way that I can never,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.540]   like I can't understand it because I can't translate
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.560]   my way to this.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.780]   We get little glimpses of this as humans though,
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.980]   by the way, because there are some parts of it,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.880]   for example, optical information, which comes from light,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.480]   is that now because we've developed the technology,
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.240]   we can actually see things.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.820]   I get this as one of my areas of research is spectroscopy.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.020]   So this means the study of light.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.700]   And I get this quote unquote, see things
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.020]   or representations of them from the far infrared
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.460]   all the way to like hard, hard x-rays,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.740]   which is several orders of magnitude
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.280]   of the light intensity, but our own human eyes,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.520]   like see a teeny, teeny little sliver of this.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.300]   So that even like bees, for example,
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.380]   see a different place than we do.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.460]   So I don't, I think if you think of,
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.020]   there's already other intelligences like around us
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.860]   in a way, in a limited way,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.320]   because of the way they can communicate.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.540]   But it's like, those are already baffling in many ways, yeah.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.200]   - If we just focus in on the senses,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.300]   there's already a lot of diversity,
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.740]   but there's probably things we're not even considering
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.020]   as possibilities.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.740]   For example, whatever the heck consciousness is,
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.240]   could actually be a door into understanding
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.540]   some physical phenomena we haven't even begun understanding.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.560]   So just like you said, spectroscopy,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.120]   there could be a similar kind of spectrum
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   for consciousness that we're just like,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.720]   we're like these dumb descendants of apes
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.620]   like walking around.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.740]   It sure feels like something to experience the color red.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.240]   But like we don't have, it's the same as in the ancient times
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   you experienced physics.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   We experienced light.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.520]   It's like, oh, it's bright.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.120]   And you know, and you construct kind of
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.720]   semi-religious kind of explanations.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.080]   - We might actually experience this faster than we thought
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.040]   'cause we might be building another kind of intelligence.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.520]   - Yeah, and that intelligence will explain to us
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.080]   how silly we are.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.760]   - There was an email thread going around the professors
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.880]   in my department already of,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.080]   so what is it going to look like to figure out
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.840]   if students have actually written their term papers
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.720]   or it's chat--
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.560]   - ChatGPT.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.380]   - ChatGPT.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.960]   It was, so as usual, we tend to be empiricists
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.160]   in my field, so of course they were in there
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.760]   like trying to figure out if it could answer like questions
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   for a qualifying exam to get into the PhD program at MIT.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.800]   They didn't do that well at that point,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.500]   but of course this is just the beginning of it.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.040]   So we have some interesting ones to go for.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.020]   - Eventually both the students and the professors
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.760]   will be replaced by ChatGPT.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.600]   - Yeah.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.920]   - And we'll sit on the beach.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.640]   - I really recommend, I don't know if you've ever seen them,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.360]   it's called The Day the Universe Changed.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.600]   - Is that a movie? - James Burke.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.960]   He's a science historian based in the UK.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.200]   He had a fairly famous series on public television
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.800]   called Connections, I think it was,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.600]   but the one that I really enjoyed
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   was The Day the Universe Changed.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.380]   And the reason for the title of it was that,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.680]   he says the universe is what we know and perceive of it.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.320]   So when there's a fundamental insight as to something new,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   the universe for us changes.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.440]   Of course, the universe from an objective point of view
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.360]   is the same as it was before, but for us it has changed.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.600]   So he walks through these moments of perception
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.920]   in the history of humanity that like changed what we were.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.880]   And so as I was thinking about coming to discuss this,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.960]   people see fusion, oh, it's still far away,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.360]   or it's been slow progress.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.280]   It's like when my godmother was born,
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.080]   people had no idea how stars worked.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.560]   So you talk about that day, that insight,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   the universe changed, it's like, oh, this is the,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.040]   I mean, and they still didn't understand
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.800]   all the parts of it, but they basically got it.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.040]   It's like, oh, because of the understanding
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.160]   of these processes, it's like we unveiled the reason
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.280]   that there can be life in the universe.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.600]   That's probably one of those days
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.400]   the universe changed, right?
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.800]   And that was in the 1930s.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.400]   - It seems like technology is developing
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.920]   faster and faster and faster.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.120]   I tend to think, just like with Chad GPT,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.860]   I think this year might be extremely interesting
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.740]   just with how rapid and how profitable
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.060]   the efforts in artificial intelligence are
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.960]   that just stuff will happen where our whole world
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.780]   is transformed like this, and there's a shock,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.480]   and then the next day you kind of go on
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.840]   and you adjust immediately.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.480]   You probably won't have a similar kind of thing
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.960]   with nuclear fusion with energy,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.880]   'cause there's probably going to be
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.240]   an opening ceremony and stuff.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.120]   An announcement, it'll take months.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.560]   But with digital technology, you can just have
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   a immediate transformation of society,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.840]   and it'll be this gasp, and then you kind of adjust,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.160]   like we always do, and then you don't even remember,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.720]   just like with the internet and so on,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.080]   how the days were before.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.060]   - And how it worked before, right.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.900]   I mean, fusion will be, because it's energy,
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.300]   it's nature is that it will be,
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.900]   and anything that has to do with energy use
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.020]   tends to be a slower transition,
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.140]   but they're the most, I would argue,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.100]   some of the most profound transitions that we make.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.900]   I mean, the reason that we can live like this
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.180]   and sit in this building and have this podcast
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.300]   and people around the world is, at its heart,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.340]   is energy use, and it's intense energy use
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.180]   that came from the evolution of starting
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.920]   to use intense energies at the beginning
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.000]   of the Industrial Revolution up to now.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.560]   It's a bedrock, actually, of all of these,
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.040]   but it doesn't tend to come overnight.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   - Yeah, and some of the most important,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.320]   some of the most amazing technology
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.240]   is one we don't notice, 'cause we take it for granted,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.040]   'cause it enables this whole thing.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.160]   - Yeah, exactly, which is energy,
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   which is amazing for how fundamental it is
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.840]   to our society and way of life
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.480]   is a very poorly understood concept, actually.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.700]   Just even energy itself, people confuse energy sources
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.260]   with energy storage, with energy transmission.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.740]   These are different physical phenomena,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.380]   which are very important.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.580]   So, for example, you buy an electric car,
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.380]   and you go, "Oh, good, I have an emission-free car."
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.180]   And, ah, but it's like, so why do you say that?
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.380]   Well, it's 'cause if I draw the circle around the car,
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.780]   I have electricity, and it doesn't emit anything.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.560]   Okay, but you plug that into a grid
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.360]   where you follow that wire back,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.080]   there could be a coal power plant,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.520]   or a gas power plant at the end of that.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.720]   Oh, really?
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.480]   You mean, so this isn't carbon-free?
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.640]   Oh, and it's not their fault, it's just,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   they don't, the car isn't a source of energy.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.520]   The underlying source of energy
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.160]   was the combustion of the fuel back somewhere.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.680]   - Plus, there's also a story of how the raw materials
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.160]   are mined in which parts of the world,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.180]   with sort of basic respect or deep disrespect
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.940]   of human rights, that happens in that mining.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.380]   So, the whole supply chain, there's a story there
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.580]   that's deeper than just a particular electric car
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.420]   with a circle around it.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.260]   - And the physics, or the science of it, too,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.300]   is the energy use that it takes to do that digging up,
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   which is also important and all that.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.900]   Yeah, anyway, so.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.740]   - Yeah.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.820]   - We wandered away from fusion, but yes.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.660]   - Oh, it's a beautiful stroll.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.820]   - But it's very important, actually,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.620]   in the context of this, just because,
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.740]   you know, those of us who work in fusion
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.740]   and these other kinds of disruptive energy technologies,
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.180]   it's interesting, I do think about what is it going to mean
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.260]   to society to have an energy source that is like this,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.300]   that would be like fusion, which has such
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.280]   completely different characteristics.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.780]   For example, free, unlimited access to the fuel,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.900]   but it has technology implications.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.560]   So, what does this mean geopolitically?
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.660]   What does it mean for how we distribute wealth
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.020]   within our society?
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.620]   It's very difficult to know, but probably profound.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.220]   - Yeah, we're gonna have to find another reason
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.140]   to start wars instead of resources.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.980]   We're gonna have to figure something out.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.300]   - We've done a pretty good job of that
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.380]   over the course of our histories, yeah.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.020]   - So, we talked about the forces of physics,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.940]   and again, sticking to the philosophical
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.180]   before we get to the specific technical stuff.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.700]   E equals MC squared, you mentioned.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.020]   How amazing is that to you,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.860]   that energy and mass are the same?
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.140]   And what does that have to do with nuclear fusion?
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.660]   - So, it has to do with everything we do.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.740]   It's the fact that energy and mass
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.900]   are equivalent to each other.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.620]   The way we usually comment to it
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.420]   is that they're just energy, just in different forms.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.980]   - Can you intuitively understand that?
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.400]   - Yes, but it takes a long time.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.660]   (laughing)
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:03.720]   Often, I teach the introductory class
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.740]   for incoming nuclear engineers,
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.460]   and so we put this up as an equation,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.120]   and we go through many iterations of using this,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.940]   how you derive it, how you use it, and so forth.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.460]   And then, usually, in the final exam,
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.220]   I would basically take all the equations
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.180]   that I've used before, and I flip it around.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.740]   Basically, instead of thinking about energy
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.620]   is equal to mass, it's sort of mass is equal to energy.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.800]   And I ask the question a different way,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.820]   and usually about half the students don't get it.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.620]   It takes a while to get that intuition, yeah.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.500]   So, in the end, it's interesting is that
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.460]   this is actually the source of all free energy,
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.980]   because that energy that we're talking about
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.540]   is kinetic energy, if it can be transformed from mass.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.820]   So, it turns out, even though we used equals mc squared,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.140]   this is burning coal and burning gas,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.540]   and burning wood is actually still equals mc squared.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.540]   The problem is that you would never know this
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.260]   because the relative change in the mass is incredibly small.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.860]   By the way, which comes back to fusion,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.340]   which is that e equals mc squared.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.500]   Okay, so what does this mean?
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.980]   It tells you that the amount of energy
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.540]   that is liberated in a particular reaction
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.740]   when you change mass has to,
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.220]   because c squared, that's the speed of light squared.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.060]   - It's a large number.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.100]   - It's a very large number, and it's totally constant
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.500]   everywhere in the universe, which is--
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.460]   - Which is another weird thing.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.300]   - Which is another weird thing, and in all rest frames,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.260]   and actually, the relativity stuff
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.420]   gets more difficult conceptually until you get through.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.980]   Anyway, so you go to that, and what that tells you
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.300]   is that it's the relative change in the mass
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.180]   will tell you about the relative amount of energy
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.820]   that's liberated, and this is what makes fusion,
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.260]   and you asked about fission as well, too.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.020]   This is what makes them extraordinary.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.420]   It's because the relative change in the mass
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.420]   is very large as compared to what you get
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.060]   like in a chemical reaction.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.020]   In fact, it's about 10 million times larger,
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.620]   and that is at the heart of why you use
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.780]   something like fusion.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.380]   It's because that is a fundamental of nature.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.980]   Like, you can't beat that, so whatever you do,
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.320]   if you're thinking about, and why do I care about this?
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.460]   Well, 'cause mass is like the fuel, right?
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.340]   So this means gathering the resources that it takes
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.820]   to gather a fuel, to hold it together, to deal with it,
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.340]   the environmental impact it would have,
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.700]   and fusion will always have 20 million times
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.780]   the amount of energy release per reaction
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.620]   that you could have, though.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.460]   So this is why we consider it the ultimate
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.740]   like environmentally friendly energy source
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.180]   is because of that.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.320]   - So is it correct to think of mass broadly
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.020]   as a kind of storage of energy?
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.580]   - Yes.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.420]   - You mentioned it's environmentally friendly,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.960]   so nuclear fusion is a source of energy.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.380]   It's cheap, clean, safe, so easy access to fuel
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.500]   and virtually unlimited supply,
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.380]   no production of greenhouse gases,
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.180]   little radioactive waste produced allegedly.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.700]   Can you sort of elaborate why it's cheap, clean, and safe?
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.460]   - I'll start with the easiest one, cheap.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.460]   It is not cheap yet, because it hasn't been made
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.980]   at a commercial scale.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.700]   - Time flies when you're having fun, but yes.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.420]   (laughing)
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.540]   - But yes, not yet.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.380]   We'll talk about that.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.940]   - Actually, we'll come back to that
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   because this is cheaper, or a more technically correct term,
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.820]   that it's economically interesting
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.260]   is really the primary challenge, actually,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.800]   of fusion at this point.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.900]   But I think we can get back to that.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.460]   So what were the other ones you said?
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.380]   - So cheap, actually, when we're talking about cheap,
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.460]   we're thinking like asymptotically.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.220]   If you take it forward several hundred years,
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.380]   that's sort of because of how much availability
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.900]   there is of resources to use.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.740]   - Of the fuel.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.560]   - Yeah, of the fuel.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.860]   - We should separate those two.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.220]   The fuel is already cheap.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.260]   It's basically free, right?
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.700]   What do you mean by basically free?
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.180]   So if we were to be using fusion fuel sources
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.380]   to power your, and it's like, that's all we had
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.660]   was fusion power plants around, and we were doing it,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.340]   the fuel cost per person are something like 10 cents a year.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.460]   It's free, okay?
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.060]   This is why it's hard to, in some ways, I think,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.780]   it's hard to understand fusion,
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.140]   because people see this and go,
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.540]   "Oh, if the fuel is free,
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.660]   "this means the energy source is free,"
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.140]   because we're used to energy sources like this.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.720]   So we spend resources and drill to get gas or oil,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.100]   or we chop wood, or we find coal, or these things, right?
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.740]   So fusion, this is what makes fusion,
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.800]   and it's also, it's not an intermittent,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.300]   renewable energy source, like wind and solar.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.580]   So it's like, but this makes it hard to understand.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.140]   So if you're saying the fuel is free,
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.740]   why isn't the energy source free?
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.220]   And it's because of the necessary technologies
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.580]   which must be applied to basically recreate the conditions
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.300]   which are in stars, in the center of stars, in fact.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.940]   So there's only one natural place in the universe
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.700]   that fusion energy occurs that's in the center of stars.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.320]   So that's going to bring a price to it,
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   depending on the size and complexity of the technology
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.760]   that's needed to recreate those things.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.080]   - And we'll talk about the details of those technologies
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.480]   and which parts might be expensive today
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   and which parts might be expensive in 200 years.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.880]   - Exactly.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.440]   It will have a revolution, I'm certain of it.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.700]   So about clean, so clean is, at its heart,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.880]   what it does is it basically converts hydrogen into,
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.280]   it's heavier forms of hydrogen,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.440]   the most predominant one that we use on earth,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.560]   and converts it into helium and some other products,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.120]   but primarily helium is the product that's left behind.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.760]   So helium, safe, inert, gas, you know.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.960]   In fact, that's actually what our sun is doing.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.700]   It's eventually going to extinguish itself
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.720]   because it'll just make so much helium
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.040]   that it doesn't do that.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.640]   So in that sense, clean because there's no emissions
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.840]   of carbon or pollutants that come directly
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.520]   from the combustion of the fuel itself.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   - And safe.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.360]   - Safe, yeah.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.840]   - We're talking about very high temperatures.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.760]   - Yeah, yeah, so this is also the counterintuitive thing.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.280]   So I told you temperatures, which like 50 million degrees,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.040]   or it actually tends to be more like
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.200]   about 100 million degrees is really what we aim for.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.760]   So how can 100 million degrees be safe?
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   And it's safe because this is so much hotter
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.580]   than anything on earth, where everything on earth
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.500]   is at around 300 Kelvin, you know,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.440]   it's around a few tens of degrees Celsius.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.560]   And what this means is that in order to get a medium
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.900]   to those temperatures, you have to completely isolate it
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.880]   from anything to do with terrestrial environment.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.920]   It can have no contact like with anything on earth,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.840]   basically.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.800]   So this means what we, this is the technology
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   that I just described, is it fundamentally what it does
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.380]   is it takes this fuel and it isolates it
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.040]   from any terrestrial conditions so that it has no idea
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.160]   it's on earth, it's not touching any object
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.800]   that's at room temperature.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.680]   - Including the walls of the containment.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.280]   - Even including the walls of the containment building
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.880]   or containment device, or even air or anything like this.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   So it's that part that makes it safe,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.760]   and there's actually another aspect to it,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.120]   but that fundamental part makes it so safe.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.940]   And the main lines approach to fusion
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.220]   is also that it's very hot,
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.580]   but there's very, very few particles at any time
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.900]   in the thing that would be the power plant.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.100]   Actually, the more correct way to do it is you say,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.420]   there's very few particles per unit volume.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.580]   So in a cubic centimeter and a cubic meter,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   something like that, so we can do this.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.700]   So right now we're, although we don't think of air really
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.920]   as a, there's atoms floating around us
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.660]   and there's a density, 'cause if I wave my hand,
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.240]   I can feel the air pushing against my face.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.540]   That means we're in a fluid or a gas, which is around us,
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.980]   that has a particular number of atoms per cubic meter.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.900]   So it's what, this actually turns out to be 10 to the 25th.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.980]   So this is one with 25 zeros behind it per cubic meter.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.500]   So we can figure out like cubic meters about like this,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.700]   the volume of this table, like the whole volume of this table.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.620]   Okay, very good.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   So like fusion, there's a few of those.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.940]   So fusion, like the mainstream one of fusion,
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.660]   like what we're working on at MIT,
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.860]   we'll have a hundred thousand times less particles
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.220]   per unit volume than that.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.420]   So this is very interesting because it's extraordinarily hot
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.560]   a hundred million degrees, but it's very tenuous.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.020]   And what matters from the engineering and safety point
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.740]   of view is the amount of energy
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.500]   which is stored per unit volume,
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.220]   because this tells you about the scenarios
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.660]   and that's what you worry about.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.180]   'Cause when those kinds of energies are released suddenly,
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.580]   it's like, what would be the consequences, right?
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.700]   So the consequences of this are essentially zero
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.800]   because that's less energy content than boiling water.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.780]   Because of the low density.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.860]   Because of the low density.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.780]   So if you take water is at about a hundred million
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.940]   to a billion times more dense than this.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.160]   So even though it's at much lower temperature,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.100]   it's actually still, it has more energy content.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.980]   So for this reason, one of the ways that I explain this
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.660]   is that if you imagine a power plant
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.500]   that's like powering Cambridge, Massachusetts,
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.220]   like if you were to, which you wouldn't do this directly,
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.220]   but if you went like this on it,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.100]   it actually extinguishes the fusion
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.700]   because it gets too cold immediately.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.380]   Yeah, so that's the other one.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.420]   And the other part is that it does not,
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.420]   because it works by staying hot
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.360]   rather than a chain reaction, it can't run out of control.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.260]   That's the other part of it.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.720]   So by the way, this is what very much
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.160]   distinguishes it from fission.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.320]   It's not a process that can run away from you
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.240]   'cause it's basically thermally stable.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.400]   - What does thermally stable mean?
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.180]   - That means is that you want to run it
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.480]   at the optimization in temperature
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.800]   such that if it deviates away from that temperature,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.920]   the reactivity gets lower.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.000]   And the reason for this is because it's hard
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.720]   to keep the reactivity going.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   Like it's a very hard fire to keep going, basically.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.340]   - Oh, so it doesn't run away from you.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.500]   - It can't run away from you.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.220]   - How difficult is the control there to keep it at that?
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.820]   - It varies from concept to concept,
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.880]   but in generally it's fairly easy to do that.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.260]   And the easiest thing, it can't physically run away from you
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.420]   because the other part of it is that there's just,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.220]   at any given time, there's a very, very small amount
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.320]   of fuel available to fuse anyway.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.540]   So this means that that's always
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.900]   intrinsically limited to this.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.640]   So even if the power consumption of the device goes up,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.440]   it just kind of burns itself out immediately.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.660]   - So you are the, just to take another tangent on a tangent,
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.660]   you're the director of MIT's Plasma Science
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.500]   and Fusion Center.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.320]   - That's right.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.260]   - We'll talk about, maybe you can mention
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.780]   some interesting aspects of the history of the center
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.380]   in the broader history of MIT,
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.740]   and maybe broader history of science and engineering
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.300]   in the history of human civilization.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.620]   But also just the link on the safety aspect.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:36.980]   How do you prevent some of the amazing reactors
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.900]   that you're designing, how do you prevent
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   from destroying all of human civilization in the process?
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.380]   What's the safety protocols?
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.780]   - Fusion is interesting 'cause it's not really
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.380]   directly weaponizable, because what I mean by that
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.660]   is that you have to work very hard to make these conditions
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.940]   at which you can get energy gain from fusion.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:04.660]   And this means that when we design these devices
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.860]   with respect to application in the energy field,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   is that they, you know, while they will,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.660]   because they're producing large amounts of power
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.500]   and they will have hot things inside of them,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.700]   this means that they have like a level of industrial hazard,
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.540]   which is very similar to what you would have
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.540]   like in a chemical processing plant
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.020]   or anything like that, and any kind of energy plant
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.340]   actually has these as well too.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.940]   But the underlying, underneath it, core technology
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.260]   can't be directly used in a nefarious way
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.140]   because of the power that's being emitted.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.100]   It just basically, if you try to do those things,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.580]   typically it just stops working.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.980]   - So the safety concerns have to do
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.680]   with just regular things that, like equipment malfunctioning,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.620]   melting of, like all this kind of stuff
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.940]   that has nothing to do with fusion necessarily.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.060]   - I mean, usually what we worry about is the viability,
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.260]   'cause in the end we build pretty complex objects
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.320]   to realize these requirements.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.580]   And so what we try really hard to do
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.820]   is like not damage those components,
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.460]   but those are things which are internal
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.580]   to the fusion device.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.220]   And this is not something that you would consider about,
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.940]   like it would, as you say, destroy human civilization
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.020]   because that release of energy is just inherently limited
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.740]   because of the fusion process.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.340]   So it doesn't say that there's zero,
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.620]   so you asked about the other feature of it, that it's safe.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.580]   So it is, the process itself is intrinsically safe,
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.860]   but because it's a complex technology,
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.740]   you still have to take into consideration aspects
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.940]   of the safety.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.660]   So it produces ionizing radiation instantaneously.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.940]   So you have to take care of this,
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.700]   which means that you shield it.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.340]   Think of like your dental x-rays
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.620]   or treatments for cancer and things like this.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.860]   We always shield ourselves from this.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.340]   So we get the beneficial effects,
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.660]   but we minimize the harmful effects of those.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.060]   So there are all those aspects of it as well too.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.300]   - So we'll return to MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.100]   but let us linger on the destruction of human civilization,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.780]   which brings us to the topic of nuclear fission.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.000]   What is that?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.820]   So the process that is inside nuclear weapons
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.060]   and current nuclear power plants.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.540]   - So it relies on the same underlying physical principle,
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.940]   but it's exactly the opposite,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.300]   which actually the names imply.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.580]   Fusion means bringing things together.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.780]   Fission means splitting things apart.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:33.780]   So fission requires the heaviest instead of the lightest
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.980]   and the most unstable versus the most stable elements.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.180]   So this tends to be uranium or plutonium,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.140]   primarily uranium.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.700]   So take uranium.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.020]   So uranium-235 is one of the,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.400]   this is one of the heaviest unstable elements.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.420]   And what happens is that this is,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.900]   fission is triggered by the fact
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.540]   that one of these subatomic particles,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.940]   the neutron, which has no electric charge,
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.080]   basically gets in proximity enough to this
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.140]   and triggers an instability effectively inside of this,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.740]   what is teetering on the border of instability
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.440]   and basically splits it apart.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.780]   And that's the fission, right?
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.140]   The fissioning.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.380]   And so when that happens,
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.940]   because the products that are,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.220]   it roughly splits in two, but it's not even that,
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.140]   it's actually more complicated.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.480]   It splits into this whole array
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.180]   of lighter elements and nuclei.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.140]   And when that happens,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   there's less rest mass left than the original one.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.020]   So it's actually the same.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.540]   So it's, again, it's rearrangement
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.200]   of the strong nuclear force that's happening,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.860]   but that's the source of the energy.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.260]   And so in the end, it's like,
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.420]   so this is a famous graph that we show everybody
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.660]   is basically, it turns out every element
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.260]   that exists in the periodic table,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.160]   all the things that make up everything,
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.380]   have a, remember you asked a good question.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.220]   It was like, so should we think of mass
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.100]   as being the same as stored energy?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.100]   Yes.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.900]   So you can make a plot that basically shows
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.140]   the relative amount of stored energy
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.380]   in all of the elements that are stable
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.420]   and make up basically the world, okay, and the universe.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.580]   And it turns out that this one has a maximum amount
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.780]   of stability or storage at iron.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.420]   So it's kind of in the middle of the periodic table
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.660]   because this goes from, it's roughly that.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.060]   And so this, what that means is that
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.500]   if you take something heavier than iron,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.100]   like uranium, which is more than twice as heavy than that,
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.340]   and you split apart, if somehow just magically,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.820]   you can just split apart its constituents
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.300]   and you get something that's lighter,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.340]   that will, because it moves to a more stable energy state,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.500]   it releases kinetic energy.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.580]   That's the energy that we use.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.700]   Kinetic energy meaning the movement of things.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.980]   So it's actually an energy you can do something with.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.860]   And fusion, it sits on the other side of that
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.760]   because it's also moving towards iron,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.200]   but it has to do it through fusion together.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.520]   So this leads to some pretty profound differences.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.820]   As I said, they have some underlying physics
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.700]   or science proximity to each other,
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.900]   but they're literally the opposite.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.860]   So fusion, why is this?
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.080]   It actually goes in the practical implications of it,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.140]   which is that fission can happen at room temperature.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.180]   It's because this neutron has no electric charge
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.460]   and therefore it's literally room temperature neutrons
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.940]   that actually trigger the reaction.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.940]   So this means in order to establish what's going on with it
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.860]   and it works by a chain reaction,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.460]   is that you can do this at room temperature.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.540]   So Enrico Fermi did this like on a university campus,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.180]   University of Chicago campus.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.860]   The first sustained chain reaction was done
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.820]   underneath a squash court with a big blocks of graphite.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.420]   It was still, don't get me wrong,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.740]   an incredible human achievement, right?
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.060]   But that's, and then you think about fusion,
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.460]   I have to build a contraption of some kind
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.380]   that's going to get to a hundred million degrees.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.660]   Okay, wow, that's a big difference.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.960]   The other one is about the chain reaction,
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.300]   that namely fission works by the fact
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.460]   that when that fission occurs,
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.220]   it actually produces free neutrons.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.700]   Free neutrons, particularly if they get slowed down
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.700]   to room temperature, can trigger other fission reactions
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.340]   if there's other uranium nearby or fissile materials.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.700]   So this means that the way that it releases energy
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.580]   is that you set this up in a very careful way
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.980]   such that every, on average, every reaction that happens
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.420]   exactly releases enough neutrons and slows down
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.540]   that they actually make another reaction,
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.340]   one, exactly one.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.500]   And what this means is that because each reaction
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.980]   releases a fixed amount of energy,
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.260]   you do this and then in time,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.220]   this looks like just a constant power output.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.060]   So that's how a fission power plant works.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.540]   - And so their control of the chain reactions
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.900]   is extremely difficult and extremely important for--
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.000]   - It's very important.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.660]   And when you intentionally design it,
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.580]   that it creates more than one fission reaction
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.160]   per starting reaction, then it exponentiates away.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.380]   Which is what a nuclear weapon is.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.620]   - Yeah, so how does an atomic weapon work?
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.700]   How does a hydrogen bomb work?
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.740]   Asking for a friend.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.700]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.580]   Yeah, so at its heart, what you do is you very quickly
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.060]   put together enough of these materials
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.340]   that can undergo fission with room temperature neutrons.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.860]   And you put them together fast enough that what happens
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.060]   is that this process can essentially grow mathematically,
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.380]   like very fast.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.060]   And so this releases large amounts of energy.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.420]   So that's the underlying reason that it works.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.380]   So you've heard of a fusion weapon.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.260]   So this is interesting is that it is,
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.860]   but it's dislike fusion energy in the sense
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:53.420]   that what happens is that you're using fusion reactions
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.860]   but it simply, it increases the gain actually of the weapon
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.140]   rather than, it's not a pure,
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.900]   at its heart, it's still a fission weapon.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.800]   You're just using fusion reactions
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.780]   as a sort of intermediate catalyst
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.220]   basically to get even more energy out of it.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.660]   But it's not directly applicable
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.780]   to be used in an energy source.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.260]   - Does it terrify you, just again,
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.340]   to step back at the philosophical,
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.940]   that humans have been able to use physics
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.940]   and engineering to create such powerful weapons?
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.820]   - I wouldn't say terrify.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.820]   I mean, we should be, this is the progress of humanity.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.700]   Every time that we've gotten access,
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.100]   you talk, you know, the day the universe changed.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.300]   It was really changed when we got access
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.180]   to new kinds of energy sources.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.420]   But every time you get access,
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.840]   and typically what this meant was you get access
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.780]   to more intense energy, right?
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.100]   And that's what that was.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.220]   And so the ability to move from burning wood
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.100]   to using coal, to using gasoline and petroleum,
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.860]   and then finally to use this is that both the potency
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.020]   and the consequences are elevated around those things.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.140]   - It's just like you said, the way that fusion,
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.940]   nuclear fusion would change the world,
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.660]   I don't think, unless we think really deeply,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.300]   we'll be able to anticipate some of the things
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.180]   we can create.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.420]   There's going to be a lot of amazing stuff,
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.020]   but then that amazing stuff is gonna enable
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.740]   more amazing stuff and more, unfortunately,
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.860]   or depending how you see it, more powerful weapons.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.820]   - Well, yeah, but see, that's the thing.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.820]   Fusion breaks that trend in the following way.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.300]   So one of them, so fusion doesn't work on a chain reaction.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.500]   There's no chain reaction, zero.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.820]   So this means it cannot physically exponentiate away on you
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.900]   'cause it works, and actually this is why star,
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.660]   by the way, we know this already,
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.380]   it's why stars are so stable,
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.980]   why most stars and suns are so stable.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.200]   It's because they are regulated through their own temperature
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.660]   and their heating.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.600]   Because what's happening is not that there's some
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.900]   probability of this exponentiating away,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.940]   is that the energy that's being released by fusion
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.900]   basically is keeping the fire hot.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.020]   And these tend to be, and when it comes down
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.660]   to thermodynamics and things like this,
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.180]   there's a reason, for example, it's pretty easy
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.660]   to keep a constant temperature, like in an oven
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.460]   and things like this, it's the same thing in fusion.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.020]   So this is actually one of the features
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.700]   that I would argue fusion breaks the trend of this
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   is that it has more energy intensity than fission on paper,
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.340]   but it actually does not have the consequences of control
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.780]   and sort of rapid release of the energy
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.700]   because it's actually, the physical system
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.980]   just doesn't want to do that.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.540]   - We're gonna have to look elsewhere for the weapons
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.500]   with which we fight World War III.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.860]   Fair enough.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   So what is plasma that you may or may not have mentioned?
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.500]   You mentioned ions and electrons and so on.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.980]   So what is plasma, what is the role
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.020]   of plasma in nuclear fusion?
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.420]   - So plasma is a phase of matter or a state of matter.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.820]   So unfortunately our schools don't,
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.340]   it's like I'm not sure why this is the case,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.260]   but all children learn the three phases of matter, right?
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.700]   So, and what does this mean?
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.860]   So we'll take water as an example.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:26.660]   So if it's cold, it's ice, it's in a solid phase, right?
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.180]   And then if you heat it up, it's the temperature
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.660]   that typically depends, sets the phase,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.900]   although it's not only temperature.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.260]   So you heat it up and you go to a liquid
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.380]   and obviously it changes its physical properties
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.060]   'cause you can pour it and so forth, right?
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.220]   And then if you heat this up enough, it turns into a gas
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.900]   and a gas behaves differently because there's a very
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.540]   sudden change in the density,
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.780]   actually that's what's happening.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.060]   So it changes by about a factor of 10,000 in density
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.940]   from the liquid phase into when you make it into steam
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.540]   at atmospheric pressure, all very good.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.220]   Except the problem is they forgot like what happens
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.420]   if you just keep elevating the temperature.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.940]   - You don't wanna give kids ideas.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.780]   (laughing)
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.060]   They're gonna start experimenting
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.620]   and they're gonna start heating up the gas.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.980]   - It's good to start doing it anyway.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.500]   So it turns out that once you get above,
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.820]   it's approximately five or 10,000 degrees Celsius,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.580]   then you hit a new phase of matter.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.300]   And actually that's the phase of matter that is for all,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.580]   pretty much all the temperatures
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.320]   that are above that as well too.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.580]   And so what does that mean?
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.940]   So it actually changes phase,
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.380]   so it's a different state of matter.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.340]   And the reason that it becomes a different state of matter
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:38.020]   is that it's hot enough that what happens is that the atoms
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.180]   that make up, remember go back to Feynman, right?
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.540]   Everything's made up of these individual things,
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.660]   these atoms.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.780]   But atoms can actually themselves be,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.760]   which are made of nuclei,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.020]   which contain the positive particles in the neutrons.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.460]   And then the electrons, which are very, very light,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.580]   very much less mass than the nucleus,
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.180]   and that surround us, this is what makes up an atom.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.860]   So a plasma is what happens when you start pulling away
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.300]   enough of those electrons that they're free from the ion.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.500]   So all the atoms that make up us up
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.760]   and this water and all that,
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.880]   the electrons are in tightly bound states
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.820]   and basically they're extremely stable.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.380]   Once you're at about 5,000 or 10,000 degrees,
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.500]   you start pulling off the electrons.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.400]   And what this means is that now the medium that is there
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.660]   its constituent particles mostly have net charge on them.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.740]   So why does that matter?
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.540]   It's because now this means that the particles can interact
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.940]   through their electric charge.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.860]   In some sense they were when it was in the atoms as well too
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.940]   but now that they're free particles,
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.380]   this means that they start,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.300]   it fundamentally changes the behavior.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.500]   It doesn't behave like a gas,
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   it doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid,
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.420]   it behaves like a plasma, right?
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.680]   And so why is it disappointing
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.940]   that we don't speak about this?
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.460]   It's because 99% of the universe is in the plasma state.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.380]   It's called stars.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.540]   And in fact, our own sun at the center of the sun
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.440]   is what clearly a plasma,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.020]   but actually the surface of the sun,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.860]   which is around 5,500 Celsius is also a plasma
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.060]   'cause it's hot enough that is that.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.680]   In fact, the things that you see,
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.380]   sometimes you see these pictures from the surface of the sun
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.620]   amazing like satellite photographs of like those big arms
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.600]   of things and of light coming off of the surface of the sun
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.660]   and solar flares, those are plasmas.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.780]   - What are some interesting ways
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.460]   that this force state of matter is different than gas?
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.380]   - Let's go to how a gas works, right?
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.620]   So the reason a gas,
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.300]   and it goes back to Feynman's brilliance
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.620]   in saying that this is the most important concept.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.220]   The reason actually solid, liquid and gas phases work
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.660]   is because the nature of the interaction
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.700]   between the atoms changes.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.820]   And so in a gas, you can think of this as being,
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.720]   this room and the things, although you can't see them,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.220]   is that the molecules are flying around,
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.660]   but then with some frequency,
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.940]   they basically bounce into each other.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.780]   And when they bounce into each other,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.380]   they exchange momentum and energy around on this.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.900]   And so it turns out that the probability and the distances
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.420]   and the scattering of those of what they do,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.300]   it's those interactions that set the,
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.380]   about how a gas behaves.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.380]   So what do you mean by this?
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.600]   So for example, if I take an imaginary test particle
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.400]   of some kind, like I spray something into the air
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.600]   that's got a particular color,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.680]   in fact, you can do it in liquids as well too,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.120]   like how it gradually will disperse away from you,
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.760]   this is fundamentally set because of the way
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.800]   that those particles are bouncing into each other.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.080]   - The probabilities of those particle bouncing.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.400]   - The rate that they go at
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.640]   and the distance that they go at and so forth.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.840]   So this was figured out by Einstein and others
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.180]   at the beginning of the Brownian motion,
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.260]   all these kinds of things.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.560]   These were set up at the beginning of the last century
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.100]   and it was really like this great revelation.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.900]   Wow, this is why matter behaves the way that it does.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.740]   Like, wow.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:07.180]   So, but it's really like, and also in liquids and in solids,
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.540]   like what really matters is how you're interacting
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.420]   with your nearest neighbor.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.860]   So you think about that one,
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.580]   the gas particles are basically going around
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.500]   until they actually hit into each other though,
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.380]   they don't really exchange information.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.540]   And it's the same in a liquid,
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.580]   you're kind of beside each other,
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.780]   but you can kind of move around.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.860]   In a solid, you're literally like stuck
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.740]   beside your neighbor, you can't move like a man.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.060]   Plasmas are weird in the sense is that it's not like that.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.700]   So it's because the particles have electric charge,
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.660]   this means that they can push against each other
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.260]   without actually being in close proximity to each other.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.060]   That's not an infinitely true statement,
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.660]   which if you go get it, it's a little bit more technical,
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.780]   but basically this means that you can start having action
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.900]   or exchange of information at a distance.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.100]   And that's in fact the definition of a plasma
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.100]   that it says, this have a technical name,
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.380]   it's called a Coulomb collision,
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.660]   it just means that it's dictated by this force,
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.560]   which is being pushed between the charged particles,
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.580]   is that the definition of a plasma is a medium
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.400]   in which the collective behavior is dominated
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.020]   by these collisions at a distance.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.060]   So you can imagine then this starts
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.900]   to give you some strange behaviors,
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.020]   which I could quickly talk about,
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.740]   like for example, one of the most counterintuitive ones
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.540]   is as plasmas get more hot,
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.600]   as they get higher in temperature,
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.000]   then the collisions happen less frequently.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.260]   Like what?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.340]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.040]   When particles go faster,
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.380]   you think they would collide more often.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.700]   But because the particles are interacting
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.380]   through their electric field,
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.500]   when they're going faster,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.540]   they actually spend less time
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.820]   in the influential field of each other,
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.580]   and so they talk to each other less
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.460]   in an energy and momentum exchange point of view.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:02.500]   It's just one of the counterintuitive aspects of plasmas.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.260]   - Which is probably very relevant for nuclear fusion.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.340]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.160]   - So if I can try to summarize
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.320]   what a nuclear fusion reactor is supposed to do.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.000]   So you have, what, a couple of elements?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.280]   What are usually the elements?
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.640]   - Usually deuterium and tritium,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.320]   which are the heavy forms of hydrogen.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.160]   - Hydrogen.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.600]   You have those, and you start heating it.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.240]   And then as you start heating it,
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.520]   I forgot the temperature you said,
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   but it becomes plasma. - About 100 million.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.440]   - No, first it becomes--
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.520]   - Oh, first it becomes plasma.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.160]   So it's a gas, and then it turns into a plasma
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.400]   at about 10,000 degrees.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.060]   And then so you have a bunch of electrons
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.460]   and ions flying around, and then you keep heating the thing.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.700]   And I guess as you heat the thing,
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.940]   the ions hit each other rarer and rarer.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:47.780]   - Yes.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.940]   - So, oh man, that's not fun.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.780]   (laughing)
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.660]   So you have to keep heating it,
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:56.060]   such that you have to keep hitting it
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.300]   until the probability of them colliding
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.140]   becomes reasonably high.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.420]   - And so in terms--
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.940]   - Also on top of that, and sorry to interrupt,
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.440]   you have to prevent them from hitting the walls
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.120]   of the reactor. - Exactly, yes, exactly.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:09.960]   - Somehow.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.080]   - So you asked about the definitions
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.840]   of the requirements for fusion.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.720]   So the most famous one, or in some sense
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.960]   the most intuitive one, is the temperature.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.760]   And the reason for that is that you can make
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.640]   many, many kinds of plasmas that have zero fusion
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.920]   going on in them.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.960]   And the reason for this is that the average,
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.000]   so you can make a plasma at around 10,000,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.480]   in fact if you come, by the way,
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.580]   you're welcome to come to our laboratory
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.020]   at the PSFC, I can show you a demonstration
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.620]   of a plasma that you can see with your eyes
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.300]   and it's at about 10,000 degrees
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.420]   and you can put your hand up beside it
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.100]   and all this and it's like, and nothing,
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.460]   there's zero fusion going on.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.140]   - So you have, sorry, what was the temperature
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:49.980]   of the plasma?
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:50.800]   - About 10,000 degrees.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.780]   - You can stick your hand in?
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.260]   - Well, you can't stick your hand into it,
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.500]   but there's a glass tube, you can basically see this.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.340]   - See it right there.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.540]   - Yeah, and you can put your hand on the glass tube
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.380]   because it's--
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.500]   - What's the color, is it purple?
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.740]   - It's purple, yeah.
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.580]   - Blue and purple.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.740]   - It's blue and purple.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.420]   It is kind of beautiful.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.580]   Yeah, plasmas are actually quite astonishing sometimes
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.660]   in their beauty.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.060]   Actually, one of the most amazing forms of plasma
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.860]   is lightning, by the way, which is instantaneous form
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   of plasma that exists on Earth but immediately goes away
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.020]   because everything else around it is at room temperature.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.900]   Yeah, so there's different requirements in this.
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:25.900]   So making a plasma takes about this,
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.820]   but at 10,000 degrees, even at a million degrees,
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.100]   there's almost no probability
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.740]   of the fusion reactions occurring.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.120]   And this is because while the charged particles
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.820]   can hit into each other,
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.060]   if you go back to the very beginning of this,
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.860]   remember I said, oh, these charged particles
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.900]   have to get to within distances
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.080]   which are like this size of a nucleus
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.160]   because of the strong nuclear force.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   Well, unfortunately, as the particles get closer,
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.460]   the repulsion that comes from the charge,
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.900]   the Coulomb force, increases
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.740]   like the inverse distance squared.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.380]   So as they get closer,
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.380]   they're pushing harder and harder apart.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.340]   So then it gets a little bit more exotic,
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.480]   which maybe you'll like though,
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.300]   that it turns out that people understood this
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.460]   at the beginning of the age
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.460]   of after Rutherford discovered the nucleus.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.500]   It's like, oh, yeah, it's like, how are we going to,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.220]   how is this gonna work, right?
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.500]   'Cause how do you get anything within these distances
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.140]   is like an inquire, extraordinary energy.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.260]   And it does, and in fact, when you look at those energies,
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.720]   they're very, very high.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:38.380]   But it turns out quantum physics comes to the rescue
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.180]   because the particles aren't actually just particles,
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.400]   they're also waves.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.220]   This is the point of quantum, right?
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.640]   You can treat them both as waves and as particles.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.540]   And it turns out if you get,
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.620]   if they get in close enough proximity to each other,
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:58.140]   then the particle pops through,
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.780]   basically this energy barrier
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.780]   through an effect called quantum tunneling,
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.900]   which is really just the transposition of the fact
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   that it's a wave so that it has a finite probability
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.400]   of this.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.620]   By the way, you talk about like,
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.100]   do you have a hard time like conceptualizing this?
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.460]   These are, this is one of them.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.300]   - Quantum tunneling is one of them?
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.820]   - Yeah, this is like throwing a ping pong ball,
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.060]   like at a piece of paper,
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.180]   and then every like, you know, 100 of them
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.820]   just like magically show up on the other side of the paper
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.580]   without seemingly breaking the paper.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.180]   I mean, to use a physical analogy.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.980]   - And that phenomena is critical
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.500]   for the function of nuclear fusion.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.620]   - Yes, for all kinds of fusion.
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.900]   So this is the reason why stars can work as well too.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.660]   Like the stars would have to be much, much hotter
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   actually to be able to,
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.840]   in fact, it's not clear that they would actually ignite,
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.780]   in fact, without this effect.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.300]   And so we get to that.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.900]   So this is why there's another requirement.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.100]   It's not, so you must make a plasma,
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.500]   but you also must get it very hot
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.580]   in order for the reactions to have a significant probability
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.860]   to actually fuse.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.220]   And it actually falls effectively almost to zero
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.060]   for lower temperatures as well too.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.820]   - So there's some nice equation
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.700]   that gets you to 50 million degrees,
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.260]   or like, or you said, practically speaking, 100 million.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.540]   - It's a really simple equation.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   It's the ideal gas law, basically, almost.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:24.260]   So in the end, you've got a certain number of particles,
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.420]   of these fusion particles in the plasma state,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:27.300]   they're in the plasma state.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.340]   There's a certain number of particles.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.980]   And if the confinement is perfect,
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:33.020]   if you put in a certain content of energy,
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.240]   then basically, eventually they just,
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.700]   they come up in a temperature and they become,
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.380]   they go up to high temperature.
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.020]   This turns out to be, by the way,
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.660]   extraordinarily small amounts of energy.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.500]   And you go, what?
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.660]   It's like, I'm getting something to like 100 million
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.340]   degrees, that's gonna take the biggest flame burner
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.580]   that I've ever seen.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.260]   No.
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.340]   And the reason for this is it goes back
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.320]   to the energy content of this.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.440]   So yeah, you have to get it to high average energy,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.820]   but there's very, very few particles.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.980]   - There's low density.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.380]   How do you get it to be low density in a reactor?
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.220]   Is this--
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.700]   - So the way that you do this is primarily, again,
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.780]   this is not exactly true in all kinds of fusion,
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.620]   but in the primary one that we work on, magnetic fusion,
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.800]   this is all happening in a hard vacuum.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.540]   So it's like it's happening in outer space.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.140]   So basically, you've gotten rid of all the other particles,
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.780]   except for these specialized--
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.300]   - So you add them one at a time?
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.540]   - No, actually, it's even easier than that.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.620]   You connect a gas valve and you basically
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.860]   leak gas into it.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.860]   - In a controlled fashion?
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.140]   - Oh, this is beautiful.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.620]   - It's a gas cylinder.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.260]   - How do you get it from hitting the walls?
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.260]   - Yeah, so now you've touched on
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.580]   the other necessary requirements.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.380]   So it turns out it's not just temperature that's required.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.720]   You must also confine it.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.140]   So what does this mean, confine it?
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.060]   - And there's two types of confinement, as you mentioned.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.100]   You mentioned the magnetic one.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:59.900]   - Magnetic one, and there's one called inertial as well too.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.060]   But the general principle actually has nothing to do with,
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.340]   in particular, with what the technology is
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.180]   that you use to confine it.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.340]   It's because this goes back to the fact
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.340]   that the requirement in this is high temperature
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.860]   and thermal content.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.360]   So it's like building a fire.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   And what this means is that when you release the energy
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.860]   into this or apply heat to this,
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.380]   if it just instantly leaks out, it can never get hot.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.100]   So you're familiar with this, it's like you've got
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.740]   something that you're trying to apply heat to,
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.380]   but you're just throwing the heat away very quickly.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.180]   This is why we insulate homes, by the way,
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.020]   and things like this.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.940]   It's like you don't want the heat that's coming
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.220]   into this room to just immediately leave
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.260]   'cause you'll just start consuming infinite amounts
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.140]   of heat to try to keep it hot.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.180]   So in the end, this is one of the requirements,
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.640]   and it actually has a name.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.980]   We call it the energy confinement time.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.580]   So this means if you release a certain amount of energy
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.020]   into this fuel, kind of how long,
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.500]   you sit there and you look at your watch,
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.180]   how long does it take for this energy
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.420]   to like leave the system?
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.500]   So you could imagine that in this room,
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.860]   that these heaters are putting energy into the air
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.100]   in this room, and you waited for a day,
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.860]   but all the heat have gone to outside.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.140]   If I open up the windows, oh, there,
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.460]   that's energy confinement time.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.980]   Okay, so it's the same concept as that.
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.220]   So this is an important one.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.500]   So all fusion must have confinement.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.220]   There's another more esoteric reason for this,
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:29.060]   which is that people often confuse temperature and energy.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.140]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.160]   So this is literally a temperature,
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:36.260]   which means that it is a system in which all the particles,
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.680]   every particle has high kinetic energy
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.260]   and is actually in a fully relaxed state,
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.100]   namely that entropy has been maximized.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.400]   I think it's a little bit more technical,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.860]   but this means that basically it is a thermal system.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.980]   So it's like the air in this room,
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.980]   it's like the water, it's the water in this.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.900]   These all have temperatures,
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.060]   which means that there's a distribution of those energies
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.560]   'cause the particles have collided so much that it's there.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.860]   So this is distinguished from having high energy particles,
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.820]   like what we have in like particle accelerators
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.300]   like CERN and so forth.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.380]   Those are high kinetic energy,
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.540]   but it's not a temperature,
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.620]   so it actually doesn't count as confinement.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.800]   So we go through all of those, you have temperature,
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.340]   and then the other requirement, not too surprising,
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.860]   is actually that there has to be enough density of the fuel.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.700]   - Enough, but not too much.
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.220]   - Enough, but not too much, yes.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:30.140]   And so in the end, the way that there's a fancy name for it,
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.540]   it's called the Lawson criterion
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.700]   because it was formulated by scientists
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:39.300]   in the United Kingdom about 1956 or 1957.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.460]   And this was essentially the realization,
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.020]   oh, this is what it's going to take,
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.380]   regardless of the confinement method.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.980]   These are, this is the basic,
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.900]   what it is actually power balances just says,
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.300]   oh, there's a certain amount of heat coming in,
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.820]   which is coming from the fusion reaction itself
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.340]   'cause the fusion reaction heats the fuel
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.340]   versus how fast you would lose it.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   And it basically summarized,
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.340]   it's summarized by those three parameters,
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.360]   which is fairly simple.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.460]   So temperature, and then the reason we say
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:12.780]   100 million degrees is because almost all way in,
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.220]   and for this kind of fusion, deuterium-tritium fusion,
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.060]   the minimum in the density
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.580]   and the confinement time product is at about 100 million.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.220]   So you almost always design your device around that minimum.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.620]   And then you try to get it contained well enough
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.940]   and you try to get enough density.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.340]   So, you know, so that temperature thing sounds crazy, right?
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.460]   That's what we've actually achieved in the laboratory.
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.700]   Like our experiment here at MIT,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.300]   when it ran at its optimum configuration,
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.420]   it was at 100 million degrees,
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:41.580]   but it wasn't actually,
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.780]   the product of the density and the confinement time
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.460]   wasn't sufficient that we were at a place
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.180]   that we were getting high net energy gain,
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.380]   but it was making fusion reactions.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.260]   So this is the sequence that you go through,
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:56.180]   make a plasma, then you get it hot enough.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.360]   And when you get it hot enough,
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.500]   the fusion reactions start happening so rapidly
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.420]   that it's overcoming the rate
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.860]   that which is leaking heat to the outside world.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.660]   And at some point it just becomes like a star,
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.960]   like a sun and our own sun and a star
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.300]   doesn't have anything plugged into it.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.580]   It's just keeping itself hot
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.140]   through its own fusion reactions.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.460]   In the end, that's really close
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.980]   to what a fusion power plant would look like.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.420]   - What does it visually look like?
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.940]   Does it look like, like you said, like purple plasma?
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.100]   - Yeah, actually it's invisible to the eye
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.940]   'cause it's so hot that it's basically emitting light
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.580]   in frequencies that we can't detect.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.320]   It's literally, it's invisible.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.780]   In fact, light goes through it,
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.340]   visible light goes through it so easy
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.460]   that if you were to look at it,
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.860]   what you would see in our own particular configuration,
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.700]   what we make is in the end is a donut shaped,
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.780]   it's a vacuum vessel to keep the air out of it.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.980]   And when you turn on the plasma,
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.580]   it gets so hot that most of it just disappears
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.940]   in the visible spectrum, you can't see anything.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.800]   And there's very, very cold plasma,
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.600]   which is between 10 and 100,000 degrees,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.660]   which is out in the very periphery of it,
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.100]   which is kind of, so the very cold plasma
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.460]   is allowed to interact with the,
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.300]   kind of has to interact with something eventually
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.220]   at the boundary of the vacuum vessel.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.460]   And this kind of makes a little halo around it
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.500]   and it glows as beautiful purple light basically.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.060]   And these are, that's what we can sense
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.540]   in the human spectrum.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.300]   - I remember reading on a subreddit called Shower Thoughts,
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.660]   which people should check out.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.780]   It's just fascinating philosophical ideas
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.180]   that strike you while you're in the shower.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.420]   And one of them was, it's lucky that fire,
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.460]   when it burns, communicates that it's hot
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.820]   using visible light, otherwise humans would be screwed.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.540]   I don't know if there's a deep, profound truth to that,
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.220]   but nevertheless, I did find it on Shower Thoughts subreddit.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.080]   - Actually, I do have, this goes off on a bit of,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.380]   you're right, this is actually, it's interesting
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.260]   'cause as a scientist, you also think
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.460]   about evolutionary functions and how we got,
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.580]   like why do we have the senses that we do?
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.780]   It's an interesting question.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.900]   Like why can bees see in the ultraviolet and we can't?
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.340]   And then you go, well, it's natural selection.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.660]   For some reason, this wasn't really
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.420]   particularly important to us, right?
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.620]   Why can't we see in the infrared and other things can?
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.460]   It's like, hmm.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.940]   - Because the people that could.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.460]   - It's a fascinating question, right?
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.020]   Obviously, there's some advantage that you have there
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.820]   that isn't there, and even color distinguishing, right,
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.140]   of something safe to eat, whatever it would be.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.100]   I'll actually go back to this because it's something
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.740]   that I tell all of my students when I'm teaching
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.860]   ionizing radiation and radiological safety.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.740]   Whatever you say, there's a cultural concern
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.420]   or that when people hear the word radiation,
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.460]   like what does this mean?
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.100]   It literally just means light is what it means, right?
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.420]   But it's light in different parts of the spectrum, right?
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:49.260]   And so it turns out besides the visible light
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:51.940]   that we can see here, we are immersed
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:55.380]   in almost the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.040]   There is visible light, there's infrared light,
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.180]   there is microwaves going around us.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.300]   That's how our cell phone works.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:05.300]   You can't, it's way past our detection capability.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.380]   But also higher energy ones, which have to do
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.680]   with ultraviolet light, how you get a sunburn,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.140]   and even x-rays and things like this at small levels
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:16.260]   are continually being, like from the concrete
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.980]   in the walls of this hotel, there's x-rays
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.980]   hitting our body continuously.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.300]   I can bring out, we can go down to the lab at MIT
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.740]   and bring out a detector and show you.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.860]   Every single room will have these.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.100]   - By our body, you mean the 10 to the 28 atoms?
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.700]   - Yeah, the 10 to the 28 atoms,
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.180]   and they're coming in and they're interacting
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.380]   with those things.
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.500]   And those, particularly the ones where the light
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.640]   is at higher average energy per light particle,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.100]   those are the ones that can possibly have an effect
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.260]   on human health.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.500]   So we, it's interesting, humans and all animals
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.600]   have evolved on Earth where we're immersed
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.580]   in that all the time.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.500]   There's a natural source of radiation all the time,
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.540]   yet we have zero ability to detect it, like zero.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.340]   - Yeah, and our ability, cognitive ability
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.340]   to filter it all out and not give a damn.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.140]   - It would probably overwhelm us, actually,
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.020]   if we could see all of it.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.740]   But my main point goes back to your thing about fire
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.500]   and self-protection.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   If ionizing radiation was such a critical aspect
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.860]   of the health of organisms on Earth,
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.960]   we would almost certainly have evolved methods
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.960]   to detect it, and we have none.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.820]   (laughing)
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.660]   Yes.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.020]   - The physical world that's all around us,
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.860]   it's just incredible.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.500]   You're blowing my mind, Dr. Dennis White.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.580]   Okay, so you have experience with magnetic confinement,
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.140]   you have experience with inertial confinement.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.520]   Most of your work has been in magnetic confinement.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.520]   But let's sort of talk about the sexy recent thing
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.420]   for a bit of a time.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.320]   There's been a breakthrough in the news
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.220]   that laser-based inertial confinement was used
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.280]   by DOE's National Ignition Facility
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.780]   at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.080]   Can you explain this breakthrough
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.060]   that happened in December?
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.500]   - Yeah, so it goes to the set of criteria
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   that I talked about before about getting high energy gain.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.420]   So in the end, what are we after in fusion
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.420]   is that we basically assemble this plasma fuel in some way,
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.300]   and we provide it a starting amount of energy,
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.260]   think of lighting the fire.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.260]   And what you want to do is get back significant excess gain
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:28.180]   from the fact that the fusion is releasing the energy.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.540]   So it's like the equivalent of we want to have a match,
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.340]   a small match, light a fire, and then the fire keeps us hot.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.360]   It's very much like that.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.780]   So as I said, we've made many of the,
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.620]   and what do I mean by we?
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.900]   It's like the fusion community has pursued aspects of this
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.860]   through a variety of different confinement methodologies,
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:52.740]   is that the key part about what happens,
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.940]   what was the threshold we had never gotten over before
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.860]   was that if you only consider the plasma fuel,
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.640]   not the total engineering system,
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.740]   but just the plasma fuel itself,
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.420]   we had not gotten to the point yet
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.660]   where basically the size of the match
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.680]   was smaller than the amount of energy
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.500]   that we got from the fusion.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.780]   - Is there a good term for when the output
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.140]   is greater than the input?
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.760]   - Yes, yes, there is.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.580]   Well, there's several special definitions of this.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.300]   So one of them is that if you, like in a fire,
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.540]   if you light a match and you have it there
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.900]   and it's an infinitesimal amount of energy
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.660]   compared to what you're getting out of the fire,
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.420]   we call this ignition, which makes sense, right?
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.440]   This is like what our own sun is as well too.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.080]   So that was not ignition in that sense as well too.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.100]   So what we call this is scientific,
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.740]   what the one that I just talked about,
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.820]   which is for some instance,
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.580]   when I get enough fusion energy released
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.780]   compared to the size of the match,
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.300]   we call this scientific break-even.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.140]   - Break-even.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.620]   - Break-even, and it's because you've gotten past the fact
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.060]   that this is unity now at this point.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:04.260]   - What is a fusion gain or as using the notation Q
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.300]   from the paper review of the Spark talk before,
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.780]   using just the same kind of term.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:09.620]   - Yeah, actually, so that is,
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.700]   I'm sorry, the technical term is Q, capital Q.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.500]   - Oh, so people actually use Q.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.940]   - We actually use capital Q,
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:17.780]   or sometimes it's called Q.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:18.680]   - So Q is taken.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.740]   - Q sub P or something like this.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.380]   Okay, so this is, which means,
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   what it means is that it's in the plasma.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.980]   So all we're considering is the energy balance
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.380]   or a gain that comes from the plasma itself.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.940]   We're not considering the technologies
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.820]   which are around it,
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.300]   which are providing the containment and so forth.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.660]   So why the excitement and so?
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.460]   Well, because for one reason,
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:44.020]   it's a rather simple threshold to get over
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.340]   to understand that you're getting more energy out
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.200]   from the fusion, even in a theoretical sense,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.160]   than you were from the starting match.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.360]   - Do you mean conceptually simple?
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.520]   - It's conceptually simple that you get past one,
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.380]   that everyone, like when you're less than one,
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.600]   that's much less interesting than getting past one.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.820]   - So there's a really big threshold to get past.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.600]   - But it really is a scientific threshold
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.240]   'cause what QP actually denotes
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.720]   is the relative amount of self-heating
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.220]   that's happening in the plasma.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.700]   So what I mean by this is that in the end,
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   in these systems, what you want is something
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.780]   where the relative amount of heating,
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.460]   which is keeping the fuel hot,
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.260]   is dominated from the fusion reactions themselves.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.860]   So it becomes, it's sort of like thinking
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.740]   like a bonfire is a lot more interesting physically
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.380]   than just holding a blowtorch to a wet log, right?
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.620]   There's a lot more dynamics,
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.140]   it's a lot more self-evolved and so forth.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.780]   And what we're excited as scientists
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.580]   is that it's clear that in that experiment
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.020]   that they actually got to a point
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.940]   where the fusion reactions themselves
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.660]   were actually altering the state of the plasma.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:05.860]   It's like, wow, I mean, we'd seen it in glimpses before
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.500]   in magnetic confinement at relatively small levels,
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.780]   but apparently it seems like in this experiment
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.780]   it's likely to be a dominant, dominated by self-heating.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:16.380]   That's a very important, that's a very--
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.500]   - So that makes it a self-sustaining type of reaction.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.700]   - It's more self-sustaining,
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.420]   it's more self-referential system in a sense.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.340]   And it sort of self-evolves in a way.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.660]   Again, it's not that it's gonna evolve
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.280]   to a dangerous state, it's just that we want to see
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.740]   what happens when the fusion is the dominant heating source.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.620]   - And we'll talk about that,
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.280]   but there's also another element,
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.600]   which is the inertial confinement,
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.020]   laser-based inertial confinement.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.620]   It's kind of a little bit of an underdog.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.580]   So a lot of the broad nuclear fission community
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.340]   has been focused on magnetic confinement.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.980]   Can you explain just how laser-based
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.140]   inertial confinement works?
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:57.140]   So it says 192 laser beams were aligned
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.380]   on a deuterium-tradium-DT target smaller than a pea.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.220]   - Yes.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.380]   - This is like-- - Or a bee-bee, actually.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.420]   - Throw, okay, well, you know, it depends.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.160]   Not all peas are made the same.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.940]   But this is like throwing a perfect strike
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.620]   in baseball from a pitch.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.460]   This is like a journalist wrote this, I think.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.980]   This is like, oh, no, it's not a journalist,
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.820]   it's DOE wrote this.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.300]   - Yeah, yeah, it could be. - Department of Energy.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.020]   - We try to use all these analogies.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.300]   - This is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.060]   from a pitcher's mount 350 miles away from the plate.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.980]   There you go.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.340]   Department of Energy.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.740]   The United States Department of Energy wrote this.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.100]   Can you explain what the lasers--
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.340]   - What actually happens.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.940]   Actually, there's usually mass confusion about this.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.100]   So what's going on in this form of energy?
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:47.820]   So the fuel is delivered in a discrete,
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.060]   the fusion fuel, the deuterium-tradium,
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.580]   is in a discrete spherical, it's more like a bee-bee.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.420]   Let's call it a bee-bee.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.780]   So it's a small one.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.300]   And all the fuel that you're gonna try to burn
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.140]   is basically there, okay?
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.540]   And it's about that size.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.660]   So how are you going to get, and it's at,
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.980]   literally, it's like at 20 degrees above absolute zero
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.820]   because the deuterium and tradium are kept
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.700]   in a liquid and solid state.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.060]   - Oh, wow, so the fuel is injected not as a gas,
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.260]   but as a solid.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.540]   - It's actually, and it's very,
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.340]   and in these particular experiments,
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.420]   they can introduce one of these targets
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.740]   once per day, approximately, something like that.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.580]   'Cause it's very, it's a kind of amazing technology,
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.340]   actually, that I know some of the people
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:31.020]   that worked on this back in the,
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:35.640]   they actually make these things at a bee-bee size
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.680]   of this frozen fuel, it's actually at cryogenic
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.740]   temperatures, and they're almost like smooth
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.900]   to the atom level.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.200]   I mean, they're amazing pieces of technology.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.420]   So what you do in the end is, what you have
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.220]   is a spherical assembly of this fuel, like a ball.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.180]   And what is the purpose of the lasers?
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.340]   The purpose of the lasers is to provide optical energy
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.820]   to the very outside of this.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.080]   And what happens is that energy is absorbed,
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.720]   because it's in the solid phase of matter,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.880]   so it's absorbed really in the surface.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.360]   And then what happens is that when it's absorbed,
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.000]   and of something called the ablator, what does that mean?
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.560]   It means it goes instantly from the solid phase
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.960]   to the gas phase, so it becomes like a rocket engine.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.760]   But you hit it very uniformly.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.720]   So all, there's like rocket engines coming off the surface.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.340]   Think of like an asteroid, almost,
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.760]   where there's like rockets coming off, almost.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.600]   So what does that do?
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   Well, what does a rocket do?
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.800]   It actually pushes, by Newton's laws, right?
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.080]   It pushes the other thing on the other side of it,
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.120]   equal and opposite reaction, it pushes it in.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.120]   So what it does is that the lasers actually don't heat.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.560]   This is what was confusing.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.320]   People think the lasers, oh, we're gonna get it
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.640]   to 100 million degrees.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.400]   In fact, you want the exact opposite of this.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.360]   What you want to do is get essentially a rocket
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.120]   going out like this, and then what happens
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.220]   is that the sphere, and this is happening
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.920]   in a billionth of a second or less, actually,
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   this rapidly, that force so rapidly compresses the fuel
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   that what happens is that you're squeezing down on it,
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.580]   and it's like, what was the, see, BB, that's bad,
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.120]   actually, BB, I should have started with a basketball.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.160]   Goes from like a basketball down to something like this
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   in a billionth of a second.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   And when that happens, I mean, scale that in your mind.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.720]   So when that happens, and this comes from,
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.000]   almost from classical physics,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   so there's some quantum in it as well, too,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.320]   but basically, if you can do this very uniformly,
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.240]   and so-called adiabatically, like you're not actually
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.400]   heating the fuel, what happens is you get adiabatic
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.280]   compression such that the very center of this thing
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.960]   all of a sudden just spikes up in temperature
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.320]   because it's actually done so fast.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.480]   So why is it called inertial fusion?
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.760]   It's because you're doing this on such fast timescales
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.600]   that the inertia of the hot fuel basically
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.440]   is still finite, so it can't push itself apart
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.640]   before the fusion happens.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.440]   - Oh, wow, so how do you make it so fast?
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.060]   - This is why you use lasers, because you're applying
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.080]   this energy in very, very short periods of time,
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.840]   like under a fraction of a billionth of a second.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.960]   And so basically that, and then the force,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.000]   which is coming from this, comes from the energy
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.520]   of the lasers, which is basically the rocket action
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.800]   which does the compression.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.440]   - So is the force, is the inward-facing force,
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.240]   is that increasing the temperature exponentially?
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.960]   - No, you wanna keep the fuel cold,
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.240]   and then just literally just ideally compress it,
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.600]   and then in something which is at the very center
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   of that compressed sphere, because you've compressed it
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.960]   so rapidly, the laws of physics basically require
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.640]   for it to increase in temperature.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.480]   - So the change in pressure.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.880]   - The effect is like, if you know the thing,
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.600]   so adiabatic cooling we're actually fairly familiar with.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.000]   If you take a spray can, right, and you push the button,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.840]   when it rapidly expands, it cools.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.020]   This is the nature of a lot of cooling technology
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.120]   we use, actually.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.080]   Well, the opposite is true, that if you would take
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.120]   all of those particles and jam them together
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.520]   very fast back in, they wanna heat up.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.240]   And that's what happens.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.120]   And then what happens is you basically have this
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.560]   very cold, compressed set of fusion fuel,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.200]   and at the center of this, it goes to this
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.680]   100 million degrees Celsius.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.120]   And so if it gets to that 100 million degrees Celsius,
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.320]   the fusion fuel starts to burn.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.160]   And when that fusion fuel starts to burn,
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.480]   it wants to heat up the other cold fuel around it,
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.600]   and it just basically propagates out so fast
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.720]   that what you would do, ideally, you would actually burn,
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.000]   in a fusion sense, most of the fuel that's in the pellet.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.220]   So this was very exciting, because what they had done
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.240]   was it's clear that they propagated this,
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.480]   they got this, what they call a hot spot,
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.620]   and in fact, that this heating had propagated
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.840]   out into the fuel, and that's the science
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.920]   behind inertial fusion.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.240]   - So the idea behind a reactor that's based
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.120]   on this kind of inertial confinement
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.240]   is that you would have a new BB every like--
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.800]   - 10 times a second or something like that.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.200]   - And that there's some kind of,
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.720]   so there's an incredible device that you kind of implied
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.140]   that kind of has to create one of those BBs.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.820]   - So you have to make the BBs very fast.
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.920]   There's reports on this, but about what does it mean,
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.000]   the starting point is can you make this gain?
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.880]   So this was a scientific achievement, primarily.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.640]   - Right, and the rest is just engineering.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.160]   - No, no, no, the rest is incredibly
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.360]   complicated engineering.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.880]   Well, in fact, there's still physics hurdles to overcome.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.800]   So where does this come from?
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.640]   And it's actually because if you want to make
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.360]   an energy source out of this,
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.520]   this had a gain of around 1.5,
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.360]   that namely the fusion energy was approximately,
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.520]   was 1.5 times the laser input energy.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.800]   Okay, this is a fairly significant threshold.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.960]   However, from the science of what I just told you
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.420]   is that there's two fundamental efficiencies
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.960]   which come into it, which really come from physics, really.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.060]   One of them is hydrodynamic efficiency.
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.400]   What I mean by this is that it's a rocket.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.440]   So this just has a fundamental efficiency built into it,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.000]   which comes out to orders of like 10%.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.640]   So this means is that your ability to do work on the system
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.560]   is just limited by that, okay?
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.920]   And then the other one is the efficiency
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.340]   of laser systems themselves,
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.960]   which if the wall plug efficiency is 10%,
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.840]   you've done spectacularly well.
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.680]   In fact, the wall plug efficiency
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.320]   of the ones using that experiments are like more like 1%,
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.160]   right?
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.800]   So when you go through all of this,
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.920]   the approximate place that you're ordering this
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.720]   is for a fusion power plant would be a gain of 100,
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.120]   not 1.5.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.320]   So you still, you know, and hopefully we see experiments
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.940]   that keep climbing up towards higher and higher gain,
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.920]   but then the whole fusion power plant
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.480]   is a totally different thing.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   So it's not one BB and one laser pulse per day.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.000]   It's like 10 times, five or 10 times per second,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.560]   like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.400]   like that, right?
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.040]   So you're doing it there.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.520]   And then comes the other aspect.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.220]   So it's making the targets, delivering them,
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.640]   being able to repeatedly get them to burn.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.200]   And then we haven't even talked about like,
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.520]   how do you then get the fusion energy out?
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.800]   Which is mainly because these things
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.260]   are basically micro implosions, which are occurring.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.040]   So this energy is coming out to some medium on the outside
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.380]   that you've got to figure out how to extract the energy
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.220]   out of this thing.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.280]   - How do you convert that energy to electricity?
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.120]   - So in the end, you have to basically convert it
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.200]   into heat in some way.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.520]   So most of the, in the end what fusion makes
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.160]   mostly is like very energetic particles
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.560]   from the fusion reaction.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.520]   So you have to slow those down in some way
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.960]   and then make heat out of it.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.360]   So basically the conversion of the kinetic energy
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.880]   of the particles into heating some engineered material
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.320]   that's on the outside of this.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.120]   - And that's, from a physics perspective,
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.640]   is a somewhat solved problem, but from an engineering,
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.520]   is still-- - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.080]   Physics, I can draw the, I can show you all the equations
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.720]   that tell you about how it slows down
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.600]   and converts kinetic energy into heat.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.640]   And then what that heat means, you know,
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.580]   you can write out like an ideal thermal cycle,
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.420]   like a Carnot cycle.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.000]   So the physics of that, yeah, great.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.600]   The integrated engineering of this is a whole other thing.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.400]   - I'll ask you to maybe talk about the difference
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.520]   between inertial and magnetic,
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.800]   but first we'll talk about magnetic.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.440]   But let me just linger on this breakthrough.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.120]   You know, it's nice to have exciting things,
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.200]   but in a deep human sense,
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.480]   there's no competition in science and engineering.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.720]   Or like you said, we're broad.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.160]   First of all, we are humanity altogether.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.960]   And you talk about this, it's a bunch of countries
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.480]   collaborating, it's really exciting.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.280]   There's a nuclear fusion community broadly.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.800]   But then there's also MIT.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.000]   There's colors and logos, and it's exciting.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.560]   And you have friends and colleagues here
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   that work extremely hard and done some incredible stuff.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:07.320]   Is there some sort of, how do you feel seeing somebody else
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.880]   get a breakthrough using a different technology?
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.600]   Is that exciting?
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.720]   Does the competitive fire get...
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.680]   (laughing)
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.680]   - All of the above.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   I mean, I have, so, you know,
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.080]   just to wave the flag a little bit.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:28.000]   So MIT was a central player in this accomplishment.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.080]   Interesting, I would say it showed our two,
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.360]   some of our two best traits.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.720]   So one of them was that,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.960]   like, how do you know that this happened?
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   (laughing)
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.160]   This measurement, right?
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.200]   So one of the ways to do this is,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.440]   if I told you is that in the DT fusion,
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.000]   what it actually, the product that comes out is helium,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   we call an alpha, but it's helium,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.200]   and a free neutron, right?
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.000]   So the neutron contains 80% of the energy released
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.400]   by the fusion reaction.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.080]   And it also, because it lacks a charge,
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.680]   it basically tends to just escape and go flying out.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   So this is what we would use eventually for,
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.520]   that's mostly what fusion energy would be.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.360]   But so what my colleagues, my scientific colleagues
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.940]   at the Plaza Science and Fusion Center built
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.840]   were extraordinary measurement tools
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.160]   of being able to see the exact details
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.840]   of not only the number of neutrons that were coming out,
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.320]   but actually what energy that they're at.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.640]   And by looking at that configuration,
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.760]   it reveals enormous, I'm not gonna scoop them
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.120]   because they need to publish the paper,
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.680]   but it reveals enormous amounts of scientific information
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.320]   about what's happening in that process
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.400]   that I just described.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.720]   So exciting, I mean, and I have colleagues there
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.160]   that have worked for 30 years on this, for that moment.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.240]   Of course you're excited for that, right?
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.540]   And it's one of those, there is nothing,
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.520]   it's hard to describe to people who aren't,
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.260]   it's almost addicting to be a scientist
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.300]   when you get to be at the forefront of research of anything.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.140]   Like when you see like an actual discovery of some kind
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:04.980]   and you're looking at it,
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.180]   particularly when you're the person who did it, right?
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.620]   And you go, no human being has ever seen this
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.980]   or understood this, it's like, it's pretty thrilling, right?
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.680]   So even in proxy, it's incredibly thrilling to see this.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.660]   It's not, I don't wanna say it's rivalry or jealousy,
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.860]   it's like, I can tell you already, fusion is really hard.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.580]   So anything that keeps pushing the needle forward
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.820]   is a good thing, but we also have to be realistic
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.900]   about what it means to making a fusion energy system.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:32.740]   That's the--
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.260]   - And then, but that's the, I mean,
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.340]   these are still the early steps,
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.060]   maybe you can say the early leaps.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.560]   So let's talk about the magnetic confinement.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.860]   What is, how does magnetic confinement work?
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.920]   What's the tokamak?
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.140]   Yeah, how does it all work?
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:50.980]   - So go back to that.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.620]   So why inertial confinement works on the same principle
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.520]   that a star works.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.900]   So like, what is the confinement mechanism in the star
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:03.900]   is gravity, because it's its own inertia
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.620]   of the something the size of the sun
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:09.860]   basically pushes literally a force by gravity
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.160]   against the center.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.780]   So the center is very, very hot, 20 million degrees,
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.940]   and literally outside the sun, it's essentially zero
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.740]   'cause it's a vacuum of space.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.140]   How the hell does that do that?
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.820]   It does that by, and it's out of,
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.580]   like, why doesn't it just leak all of its heat?
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.540]   It doesn't leak its heat because it all is held together
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:30.340]   by the fact that it can't escape because of its own gravity.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.060]   So this is why the fusion happens in the center of the star.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.180]   Like we think of the surface of the sun as being hot.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.060]   That's the coldest part of the star.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.540]   So if our own sun, this is about 5,500 degrees,
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.400]   a beautiful symmetry, by the way, it's like,
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.580]   so how do we know all this?
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.060]   'Cause we can't of course see directly
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.060]   into the interior of the sun,
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.120]   but by knowing the volume and the temperature
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.160]   of the surface of the sun,
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.300]   you know exactly how much power it's putting out.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.380]   And by this, you know that this is coming
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.940]   from fusion reactions occurring at exactly the same rate
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.260]   in the middle of the sun.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.540]   - Is it possible as a small tangent
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   to build an inertial confinement system like the sun?
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.380]   Is it possible to create a sun?
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.140]   - It is of course possible to make a sun,
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.540]   although we do have stars, but it is not impossible on Earth
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:17.280]   because for the simple reason that it takes,
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.560]   the gravitational force is extremely weak.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.540]   And so it takes something like the size of a star
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.180]   to make fusion occur in the center.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.020]   - Well, I didn't mean on Earth.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.820]   I mean, if you had to build like a second sun,
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:29.660]   how would you do it?
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.320]   - You can't, there's not enough hydrogen around.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.860]   - So the limiting factor is just the hydrogen.
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.940]   - Yeah, I mean, the forces and energy that it takes
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.760]   to assemble that is just mind boggling.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.860]   (laughing)
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.700]   - All right. - So we wouldn't do that.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.420]   - To be continued. - Yeah, to be continued.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.560]   So what are we doing it with?
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.020]   So in the one that I just described,
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.740]   it's like you say, so you have to replace this
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.620]   with some force which is better than that.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.180]   And so what I mean by that is it's stronger than that.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:58.540]   So what I talked about the laser fusion,
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.900]   this is coming from the force,
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.820]   which is enormous compared to gravity,
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:05.300]   like from the rocket action of pushing it together.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.920]   So in magnetic confinement, we use another force of nature,
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.100]   which is the electromagnetic force.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:14.520]   And that's very, it's orders and orders of magnitude
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.680]   stronger than the gravitational force.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.340]   And the key force that matters here
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.340]   is that if you have a charged particle,
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.500]   that namely it's a particle that has an electric,
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.180]   net electric charge,
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.060]   and it's in the proximity of a magnetic field,
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.660]   then there is a force which is exerted on that particle.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.980]   So it's called the Lorentz force
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.680]   for those who are keeping track.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.060]   So that is the force that we use
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.620]   to replace physical containment.
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:44.380]   So this again, how do you hold something
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.860]   at a hundred million degrees?
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:48.380]   It's impossible in a physical container.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:49.780]   This is not like, you know,
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.540]   it's not this plastic bottle holding in this liquid
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.380]   or a gas chamber.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.300]   What you're doing is you're using,
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.480]   you're immersing the fuel in a magnetic field
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.380]   that basically exerts a force at a distance.
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:03.860]   This comes back again to again,
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.820]   like why plazas are so strange.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.020]   It's the same thing here.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.820]   And if it's immersed in this magnetic field,
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.940]   you're not actually physically touching it,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.240]   but you're making a force go onto it.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.240]   So that's the inherent feature of magnetic confinement.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.620]   And then magnetic confinement devices are like a tokamak,
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.780]   are basically configurations which exploit the features
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.740]   of that magnetic containment.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.820]   There's several features to it.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.980]   One is that the stronger the strength
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.260]   of the magnetic field, the stronger the force.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:36.980]   And for this reason is that if you increase the strength
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.460]   of magnetic fields, this means that the containment,
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.380]   because namely the force which you're pushing against it
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.140]   is more effective.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:48.020]   And the other feature is that there is no force.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.100]   So for those who remember magnetic fields,
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.060]   what are these things?
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:52.620]   They're also invisible.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.700]   But if you think of a permanent magnets
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:57.480]   or your fridge magnet, there are field lines,
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.180]   which we actually designate as arrows,
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.000]   which are going around.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.380]   You sometimes see this in school when you have
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:06.040]   the iron filings on a thing and you see the directions
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.580]   of the magnetic field lines, or when you use a compass.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.220]   So that's telling you,
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.900]   because we're living in an immersed magnetic field
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.620]   made by the earth, which is at very low intensity,
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.460]   but it's strong enough that we can actually see
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.460]   what direction is it.
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.260]   So this is the arrow that the magnetic field is pointing.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.220]   It's always pointing north and for us.
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:27.180]   So an interesting feature of this force
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.500]   is that there is no force along the direction
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.060]   of the magnetic field.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.320]   There's only force in the directions orthogonal
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.820]   to the magnetic field.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.980]   So this, by the way, is a huge deal
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:40.880]   in a whole other discipline of plasma physics,
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.200]   which is like the study of our near atmosphere.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.320]   So the study of aurora borealis,
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.860]   what's happening in the near atmosphere,
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.020]   what happens when solar flares hit the magnetic field.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.960]   In fact, remember I said fusion is the reason
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.020]   that life is responsible in the universe?
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.500]   Well, you could also argue so is magnetic confinement
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.340]   because the charged particles which are being emitted
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.860]   from the galaxy and from our own star
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:09.820]   would be very, very damaging on earth.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.900]   So we get two layers of protection.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.740]   One is the atmosphere itself,
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.540]   but the other one is the magnetic field
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.940]   which surrounds the earth and basically traps
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.740]   these charged particles so they can't get away.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.860]   It's the same deal.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.700]   - How do you create a strong magnetic field?
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.700]   - Yeah, so--
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.780]   - With a giant magnet.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.060]   - Giant magnet, yeah.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.620]   So it's basically true.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.460]   - Engineering is awesome.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.940]   - There's essentially two ways to create a magnet.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.900]   So one of them is that we're familiar with
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.220]   like fridge magnets and so forth.
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.180]   These are so-called permanent magnets.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.300]   And what it means is that within these,
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.980]   the atoms arrange in a particular way
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.100]   that it produces the electrons basically
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.340]   arranged in a particular way that it produces
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.460]   a permanent magnetic field that is set by the material.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:53.620]   So those have a fundamental limitation
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.860]   how strong they can be and they also tend to have
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.420]   this like circular shape like this.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.060]   So we don't typically use those.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:03.340]   So what we use are so-called electromagnets.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.180]   And what is this?
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.940]   It's like, so the other way to make a magnetic field
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:11.220]   also go back to your elementary school physics
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.380]   or science class is that you take a nail
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.020]   and you wrap a copper wire around it
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.020]   and connect it to a battery,
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.860]   then it can pick up iron filings.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.100]   This is an electromagnet.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.700]   And it's simplest what it is, it's an electric current
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.020]   which is going in a pattern around and around and around.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.420]   And what this does is it produces a magnetic field
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.580]   which goes through it by the laws of electromagnetism.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.500]   So that's what an electric,
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.620]   so that's how we make the magnetic field
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.060]   in these configurations.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.580]   And the key there is that it's not limited
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.460]   by the magnetic property of the material.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.820]   The magnetic field amplitude is set by the amount of,
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.660]   the geometry of this thing and the amount of electric
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.100]   current that you're putting through.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.500]   And the more electric current that you put through,
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500]   the more magnetic field that you get.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:01.940]   The closest one that people maybe see is
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:06.940]   one of my favorite skits actually was Super Dave Osborne
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.540]   on, it's probably past years,
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.820]   like in a show called Bizarre.
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.820]   Super Dave Osborne, which is a great comedian called,
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.700]   he was a stunt man and one of his tricks was that he was,
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.660]   he gets into a car and then one of those things
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.540]   in the junkyard comes down,
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.460]   and picks up the car and then puts it into the crusher.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.540]   This is his stunt, which is pretty hilarious.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.540]   Anyway, but that thing that picks him up,
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:29.620]   like how does that work?
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:31.100]   That's actually not a permanent magnet,
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.140]   it's an electromagnet.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.260]   And so you can turn, by turning off and on the power supply,
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:38.380]   it turns off and on the magnetic field.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.820]   So this means you can pick it up and then when you switch
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:43.780]   it off, the magnetic field goes away and the car drops.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.420]   Okay, so that's what it looks like.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.580]   - Speaking of giant magnets, MIT and Commonwealth Fusion
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:55.540]   Systems, CFS, built a very large, high temperature,
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:58.980]   superconducting electromagnet that was ramped up
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.140]   to a field strength of 20 Tesla,
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.300]   the most powerful magnetic field of its kind
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.720]   ever created on Earth.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.740]   Because I enjoy this kind of thing,
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.300]   can you please tell me about this magnet?
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.740]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.900]   Oh, it was, it's fun, yeah.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.140]   There's a lot to parse there.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.420]   So maybe, so we already explained an electromagnet,
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.560]   which in general is, what you do is you take electric
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.940]   current and you force it to follow a pattern of some kind,
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.820]   typically like a circular pattern,
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:29.580]   around and around and around and around.
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.780]   It goes, the more time, the more current and the more times
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.580]   it goes around, the stronger the magnetic field
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.380]   that you make of it.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:37.780]   And as I pointed out, it's like really important
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.820]   in magnetic confinement because it is the force
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.900]   that's produced by that magnet.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:44.400]   In fact, technically it goes like the magnetic field
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.740]   squared because it's a pressure which is actually
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:52.580]   being exerted on the plasma to keep it contained.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.940]   - Just so we know, for magnetic confinement,
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:57.220]   what is usually the geometry of the magnet?
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.820]   What are we supposed to imagine?
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.260]   - Yeah, so the geometry is typically that,
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:04.380]   typically is what you do is you want to produce
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:07.300]   a magnetic field that loops back on itself.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:10.920]   And the reason for this was, goes down to the nature
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:15.440]   of the force that I described, which is that there's no,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.540]   there's no containment or force along the direction
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.980]   of the magnetic field.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:21.380]   So here's a magnetic field.
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:25.340]   In fact, what it's more technically or more graphically
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:28.140]   what it's doing is that when the plasma is here,
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:31.260]   here's plasma particles here, here's a magnetic field.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.260]   What it does is it forces all those,
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:37.100]   because of this Lorentz force, it makes all of those
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.500]   charged particles execute circular orbits
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.460]   around the magnetic field.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.980]   And they go around like this.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:46.500]   But they stream freely along the magnetic field line.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.100]   So this is why the nature of the containment
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.700]   is that if you can get that circle smaller and smaller,
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:56.020]   it stays further away from Earth, temperature materials.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.860]   That's why the confinement gets better.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.520]   But the problem is is that because it free streams along,
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:03.340]   so we just have a long straight magnetic field,
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:06.660]   okay, it'll just keep leaking out the ends like really fast.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.940]   So you get rid of the ends.
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.480]   So you basically loop it back around.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.260]   So what these look like are typically donut shaped
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.580]   or more technically toroidal shape,
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.760]   but donut shaped things where this collection
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.920]   of magnetic fields loops back on itself.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.420]   And it also, for reasons which are more complicated
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.640]   to explain, basically it also twists slowly around
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.480]   in this direction as well too.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.960]   So that's what it looks like.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.520]   That's what the plasma looks like,
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.320]   because that's what the fuel looks like.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.340]   So then this means is that the electromagnets
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:41.680]   are configured in such a way that it produces
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.160]   the desired magnetic fields around this.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.800]   - How precise does this have to be?
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.840]   - You were probably listening to our conversation
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.400]   with some of my colleagues yesterday.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.480]   So it's actually, it depends on the configuration
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.240]   about how you're doing it.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.280]   - The configuration of the plasma, sorry.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.120]   - The configuration of the electromagnets
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.520]   and about how you're achieving this requirement.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.980]   It's fairly precise, but it doesn't have to be,
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.520]   particularly in something like a tokamak,
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.960]   what we do is we produce planar coils,
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.000]   which just mean they're flat, and we situate them.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.680]   So if you think of a circle like this,
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.680]   what does it produce if you put current through it?
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.640]   It produces a magnetic field which goes
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.720]   through the circle like this.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.640]   So if you align many of them like this, this, this, this,
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.800]   there's things on line, you can go see the picture.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.600]   You keep arranging these around in a circle itself,
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.200]   this forces the magnetic field lines
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.600]   to basically just keep executing around like this.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.800]   So you tend to align.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.520]   That one tends to, well, it requires good alignment.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.320]   It's not like insane alignment,
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.120]   because you're actually exploiting the symmetry
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.200]   of the situation to help it.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.600]   There's another kind of configuration of magnetic,
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.000]   of this kind of magnetic confinement called a stellarator,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.800]   which is, we have these names for historic reasons.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.080]   - Which is different than a tokamak.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.920]   - It's different than a tokamak,
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.960]   but actually works on the same physical principle,
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.240]   that namely, in the end it produces a plasma
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.000]   which loops in magnetic fields,
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.400]   which loop back on themselves as well.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.800]   But in that case, the totality, basically,
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.840]   the totality of the confining magnetic field
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.200]   is produced by external three-dimensional magnets,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   so they're twisted.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:23.080]   And it turns out the precision of those is more stringent.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.840]   - So are tokamaks by far more popular
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.280]   for research and development currently than stellarators?
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.720]   - Of the concepts which are there,
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.280]   the tokamak is by far the most mature
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.120]   in terms of its breadth of performance
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.000]   and thinking about how it would be applied
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.640]   in a fusion energy system.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.360]   And the history of this was that many,
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.520]   in fact, you asked, if we go back to the history
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.400]   of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center,
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.600]   the history of fusion is that people,
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.440]   scientists had started to work on this in the 1950s.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.080]   It was all hush-hush and Cold War and all that kind of stuff.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.400]   And it's like, they realized, holy cow,
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.200]   this is like really hard.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.720]   Like, we actually don't really know what we're doing
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.400]   in this, 'cause everything was at low temperatures,
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.240]   they couldn't get confinement.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.080]   It was interesting.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.920]   And then they declassified it,
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.520]   and this is one of the few places
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.960]   that the West and the Soviet Union
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.920]   actually collaborated on was the science of this.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.760]   - Even during the Cold War.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.320]   - Even during the middle of the Cold War, it was really,
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.080]   and this actually perpetuates all the way till now,
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.800]   for we can talk about the project
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.640]   that that is sort of captured in now.
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.600]   But, and the reason they declassified it
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.920]   is because everything kind of sucked, basically,
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.840]   about trying to make this confinement
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.760]   in high-temperature plasma.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.000]   And then the Russians, then the Soviets,
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.760]   came along with this device called a TOKAMAK,
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.560]   which is a Russian acronym, which basically means
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:56.040]   magnetic coils arranged in the shape of a donut.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:01.040]   And they said, holy cow, like everyone was stuck
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.840]   at like a meager, like half a million degrees,
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.920]   or half a million degrees, which is like infusion
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.720]   in terms of zero, basically.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.320]   And then they come along and they say,
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.080]   oh, we've actually achieved a temperature
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.440]   20 times higher than everybody else.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.320]   And it's actually started to make fusion reactions,
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.080]   and everyone just go, oh, no way, it's just hype.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.840]   It's like, there's no way, 'cause we've failed at this.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.800]   It's a great story in the history of fusion,
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.520]   is that then, but they insisted, they said,
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.160]   no, look, you can see this from our data.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.080]   It's like, this thing is really hot,
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   and it seems to be working.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.320]   This is late 1960s.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.000]   And there was a team that went from the United Kingdom's
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.640]   fusion development lab, and they brought this very fancy,
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.360]   amazing new technology called a laser.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:51.160]   And they used this laser, and they shot the laser beam
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.960]   like through the plasma, and by looking at the scattered
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.920]   light that came from it, they go, basically,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.240]   the scattered light gets more broadened in its spectrum
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.360]   if it gets hotter.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.920]   So you could exactly tell the temperature of this,
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.080]   and even though you're not physically touching the plasma,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.880]   it's like, holy cow, you're right, it is.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.400]   It is 10 million degrees.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.400]   And so this was one of those explosions of everyone
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.240]   in the world then wanted to build a token back,
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.680]   because it was clearly like, wow, this is so far ahead
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.480]   of everything else that we tried before.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.840]   So that actually has a part of the story to MIT
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.400]   and the Plasma Science and Fusion Center was,
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.160]   why is there a strong fusion and a major fusion program
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160]   at MIT?
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.360]   It was because we were host to the Francis Bitter
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.960]   Magnet Laboratory, which is also the National High Field
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.480]   Magnet Laboratory.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.080]   Well, you can see where this goes, right?
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.280]   From this, you know, we're kind of telling the stories
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   backwards almost, but, you know, the advent of a tokamak,
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280]   along with the fact that you could make very strong
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.400]   magnetic fields with the technology that had been
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.040]   developed with that laboratory, that was the origins
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.520]   of sort of pushing together the physics of the plasma
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.520]   containment and the magnet technology and put them together
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.920]   in a way that I would say is, you know, a very typical
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.480]   MIT success story, right?
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.680]   We don't do just pure science or pure technology,
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.560]   we sort of set up this intersection between them.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.480]   And there were several pioneers of people at MIT,
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.520]   like Bruno Coppi, who's a professor in the physics
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.240]   department and Ron Parker, who was a professor
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.320]   in electrical engineering and nuclear engineering.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.200]   It's like even the makeup of the people, right,
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.080]   has got this blends of science and engineering in them.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.080]   And that's actually was the origin of the Plasma Science
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.960]   and Fusion Center was doing those things.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.240]   So anyway, so back to this.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.880]   So why, so yes, tokamaks have been, have achieved
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.760]   the highest in magnetic fusion by far, like the best
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.920]   amounts of these conditions that I talked about.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.840]   And in fact, pushed right up to the point where they were
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.000]   near QP of one, they just didn't quite get over one.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.400]   - So can we actually just linger on the collaboration
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.460]   across different nations, just maybe looking at
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.100]   the philosophical aspect of this.
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:10.440]   Even in the Cold War, there's something hopeful to me
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:14.400]   besides the energy, that these giant international projects
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.740]   are a really powerful way to ease some of the geopolitical
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:23.080]   tension, even military conflict across nations.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:28.080]   There's a war in Ukraine and Russia.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.080]   There's a brewing tension and conflict with China.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:38.080]   Just the world is still seeking military conflict,
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.860]   cold or hot.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:43.640]   What can you say about sort of the lessons of the 20th
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:46.660]   century and these giant projects and their ability
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:48.800]   to ease some of this tension?
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.460]   - So it's a great question.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:53.380]   So as I said, there was a reason, because it was so hard,
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:57.060]   that was one of the reasons they declassified it.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.740]   And actually they started working together in some sense
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.300]   on it as well too.
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.300]   And I think it was really, there was a heuristic
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:11.080]   or altruistic aspect to this.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.700]   It's like, this is something that could change the future
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:19.040]   of humanity and its nature and its relationship with energy.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.740]   Isn't this something that we should work on together?
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.260]   Right, and that went along in those ones.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.940]   And in particularly that any kind of place where you can
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:33.260]   actually have an open exchange of people who are sort of
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.060]   at the intellectual frontiers of your society,
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:37.500]   this is a good thing, right?
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.180]   Of being able to collaborate.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.780]   I've had the, I mean, I have had an amazing career.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:47.180]   I've worked with people from, it's like hard to throw a dart
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.280]   at a country on the map and not hit a country of people
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.520]   that I've been able to work with.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.320]   How amazing is that?
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.840]   And even just getting small numbers of people to bridge
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:01.840]   the cultural and societal divides is a very important thing.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.680]   Even when it's a very teeny fraction
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.280]   of the overall populations, it can be held up
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.400]   as an example of that.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.480]   But it's interesting that if you look at then
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.960]   that continued collaboration, which continues to this day,
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.460]   is that this actually played a major role, in fact,
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:24.700]   in East-West relations, or like Soviet-West relations,
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:29.160]   is that back in the Reagan-Gorbachev days,
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.020]   which of course were interesting in themselves
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:36.020]   of all kinds of changes happening on both sides, right?
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:41.140]   But still, like a desire to push down the stockpile
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.540]   of nuclear weapons and all that, within that context,
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.700]   there was a fairly significant historic event
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.600]   that at one of the Reagan-Gorbachev summits
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.900]   is that they had really, they didn't get there.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.180]   Like they couldn't figure out how to bargain
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.940]   to the point of some part of the treaty,
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.100]   I can't remember the details of it anymore.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:06.540]   But they needed some kind of a symbol, almost, to say,
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.420]   but we're still gonna keep working towards something
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:11.020]   that's important for all of us.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:11.840]   What did they pick?
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.880]   A fusion project.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:18.340]   And that was in the mid-1980s, and actually,
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.780]   then after, so they basically signed an agreement
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:24.340]   that they would move forward to like literally collaborate
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.540]   on a project whose idea would be to show
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:31.540]   large net energy gain in fusions, commercial viability,
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.100]   and work together on that.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.340]   And very soon after that, Japan joined,
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:37.180]   as did the European Union.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:41.940]   And now, that project, it evolved
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.020]   over a long period of time,
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.700]   it had some interesting political ramifications to it,
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.620]   but in the end, this actually also had South Korea,
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:53.140]   India, and China join as well, too.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:58.140]   So you're talking about a major fraction of,
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.860]   and now Russia, of course, instead of the Soviet Union.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.000]   And actually, that coalition is holding together
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.520]   despite the obvious political turmoil
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.280]   that's going around on all those things.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.160]   And that's a project called ITER,
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.700]   which is under construction in the south of France
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:14.540]   right now.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.940]   - Can you actually, before we turn to the giant magnet,
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.380]   and maybe even talk about Spark,
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:21.940]   and the stuff going, all amazing stuff going on at MIT,
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:22.780]   what is ITER?
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:26.300]   What is this international nuclear fusion mega project
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.780]   being built in the south of France?
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:31.380]   - So its scientific purpose is a worthy one
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.340]   that it's essentially, in any fusion device,
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.540]   the thing that you want to see is more and more
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.540]   relative amounts of self-heating.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.700]   And this is something that had not been seen,
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.640]   although we had made fusion reactions,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.420]   and we'd seen small amounts of the self-heating,
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.640]   we never got to a dominant,
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.420]   this actually goes to this QP business, okay?
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.380]   The goal of ITER,
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.080]   and it shifted around a little bit historically,
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.020]   but fairly quickly became,
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:57.740]   we want to get to a large amount of self-heating.
[01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:59.700]   So this is why it has,
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:03.480]   its primary feature is to get to QP of around 10,
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.360]   and through this, this is a way to study this plasma
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.740]   that has more higher levels of self-determination
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:12.420]   around on it.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.400]   But it also has another feature,
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   which was let's produce fusion power at a relevant scale.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.720]   And actually they're linked together,
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.220]   which actually makes sense when you think about it,
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.640]   is that because the fusion power
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.480]   is the heating source itself,
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.360]   this means that they're linked together.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.660]   And so ITER is projected to make
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:36.760]   about 500 million watts of fusion power.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:38.460]   So this is a significant amount,
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:41.860]   like this is what you would use for powering cities.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:43.980]   - So it's not just the research,
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:46.460]   it is the development of really trying to achieve scale here,
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.340]   so self-heating and scale.
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.740]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:53.840]   So this meant then too is the development
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.380]   of an industrial base
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.100]   that can actually produce the technologies
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.100]   like the electromagnets and so forth.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.860]   And to do it with, it is a tokamak,
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.940]   it is one of these, yes.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:03.780]   But very interesting,
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:06.920]   it also revealed limitations of this as well too.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.760]   - Like what?
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.520]   - Well, it's interesting is that it is clearly on paper,
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.640]   and in fact, in practice as well too,
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.920]   the world, and very different political systems,
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:25.160]   and you consider at least geopolitical or economic rivals
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.520]   or whatever you want to use.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.480]   Like working towards a common cause,
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.400]   and one that we all think is worthy,
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.580]   is very like, okay, that's very satisfying.
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.760]   But it's also interesting to see the limitations of this,
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.880]   it's because, well, you've got seven chefs in the kitchen.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.780]   So what does this mean in terms of the speed of the project
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:50.180]   and the ability to govern it and so forth?
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.900]   It's just been a challenge, honestly, around this.
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:56.060]   And this is, I mean, it's very hard technically
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:00.060]   what's occurring, but when you also introduce such levels,
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.660]   I mean, this isn't just me saying it,
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:03.940]   there's like GAO reports from the US government
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:07.740]   and so forth, it's hard to like steer all of this around.
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.540]   And what that's tended to do is make it,
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:15.140]   it's not the fastest decision-making process.
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:17.820]   My own personal view of it was, it was interesting
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:19.420]   'cause you asked, you said about the magnet
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.620]   and commonwealth fusion systems.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:25.580]   It was, I worked most of my career on ITER,
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:28.940]   because when I came into the field in the early 1990s,
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:32.380]   when I completed my PhD and started to work,
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:34.700]   this was one of the most, like you can't imagine
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:36.340]   being more excited about something,
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:38.620]   like we're going to change the world with this project,
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:39.900]   we're gonna do these things.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.300]   And we just like poured like an entire generation,
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.380]   and afterwards as well too, just poured their imagination
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:48.900]   and their creativity about making this thing work.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.740]   Very good.
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:54.260]   But also at some point though, when it got to being
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:56.980]   another five years of delay or a decade of delay,
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:00.860]   you start asking yourself, well, is this what I want to do?
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.620]   Right, am I going to wait for this?
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.620]   So it was a part of me starting to ask questions
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.180]   with my students, I was like, is there another way
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:13.020]   that we can get to this extremely worthwhile goal
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.940]   that maybe it's not that pathway?
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:19.380]   And the other part that was clearly frustrating to me,
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:21.860]   'cause I'm an advocate of fusion.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:23.940]   You asked me about, was I, I was like,
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:27.140]   well, it's laser fusion or inertial fusion
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:28.260]   or magnetic fusion.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:30.180]   I just want fusion energy, okay?
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.860]   'Cause I think it's so important to the world is that,
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:36.420]   but the other thing, if that's the case,
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.620]   then why do we have only one attempt at it
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.020]   on the entire planet, which was ITERF?
[01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:47.900]   It's like, that makes no sense to me, right?
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:50.240]   We should have multiple attempts at this
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.320]   with different levels of whatever you want to think about it.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.640]   Technical, schedule, scientific risk,
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.960]   which are incorporated in them,
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.400]   and that's going to give us a better chance
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.240]   of actually getting to the goal line.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.680]   - With that spirit, you're leading MIT's effort
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.160]   to design SPARC, a compact, high-field,
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.640]   DT-burning tokamak.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.720]   How does it work?
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.120]   What is it, what's the motivation?
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.960]   What's the design, what are the ideas behind it?
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.800]   - Yeah, at its heart, it's exactly the same concept as ITER.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.200]   So it's basically a configuration of electromagnets.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.360]   It's arranged in the shape of a donut,
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.840]   and within that, we would do the same thing
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.960]   that happens in all the other tokamaks,
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.920]   and including in ITER and in this one,
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.360]   is that namely, you put in gas,
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.640]   make it into a plasma, you heat it up,
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.040]   it gets to about 100 million degrees.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.020]   The differentiator in SPARC is that
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:43.040]   we use the actual deuterium-tritium fuel,
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.040]   and because of the access to very high magnetic fields,
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.040]   it's in a very compact space.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:53.960]   It's very, very small.
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.280]   What do I mean by small?
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   So it's 40 times smaller in volume than ITER,
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:02.880]   but it uses exactly the same physical principles.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.040]   So this comes from the high magnetic field.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.360]   So in the end, like, why does this matter?
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.680]   What it does is it does those things,
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:12.080]   and it should get to the point where it's producing
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.040]   over 100 million watts of fusion power,
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.840]   but remember, it's 40 times smaller.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.880]   So ITER was 500 megawatts.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.640]   Technically, our design is around 150 megawatts,
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:25.360]   so it's only about a factor of three difference,
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.380]   despite being 40 times smaller.
[01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:32.500]   And we see QP large,
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.280]   order of 10 or something like this.
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.020]   At that state, it's very important scientifically,
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.680]   because this basically matches what ITER is looking to do.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.480]   The plasma's dominated by its own heating.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.400]   That's very, very important.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.480]   And it does that for about 10 seconds.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.680]   And the reason it's for 10 seconds is that in terms of,
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.960]   that basically allows everything to settle
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.240]   in terms of the fusion in the plasma equilibrium.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.200]   Everything is nice and settled.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.240]   So you know, you have seen the physical state
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.040]   at which you would expect a power plant to operate
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.360]   basically for magnetic fusion.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.360]   Like, wow, right?
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.240]   But it's more than that.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.200]   And it's more than that, it's because about
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.420]   who's building it and why and how it's being financed.
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.920]   So that scientific pathway was made possible
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:26.300]   by the fact that we had access to a next generation
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.540]   of magnet technology.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.660]   So to explain this real quick, why do we call it,
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.400]   you said it in the words, a superconducting magnet.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.760]   What does this mean?
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.840]   Superconducting magnet means that the materials
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.540]   which are in the electromagnet
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.420]   have no electrical resistance.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:44.080]   Therefore, when the electric current is put into it,
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.400]   the current goes around unimpeded.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.520]   So it could basically keep going around and around,
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.320]   you know, technically for infinity.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.080]   And what that means, or for eternity.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.820]   And what that means is that when you energize
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.800]   these large electromagnets, they're using basically
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.580]   zero electrical power to maintain them.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.840]   Whereas if you would do this in a normal wire, like copper,
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.240]   you basically make an enormous toaster oven
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.320]   that's consuming enormous amounts of power
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.600]   and getting hot, which is a problem.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.600]   That was the technical breakthrough that was realized
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.160]   by myself and at the time, my students and postdocs
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.360]   and colleagues at MIT, was that we saw the advent
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.720]   of this new superconducting material,
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.640]   which would allow us to access much higher magnetic fields.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.480]   It's basically a next generation of the technology.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.720]   And it was quite disruptive to fusion.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.240]   That namely, what it would allow,
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.080]   that if we could get to this point
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.560]   where we can make the round 20 Tesla,
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.800]   we knew by the rules of tokamaks that this is going to be,
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.040]   is going to allow us to vastly shrink
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.520]   like the sizes of these devices.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:54.120]   So it wouldn't take, although it's a worthy goal,
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:57.740]   it wouldn't take a seven nation international treaty
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.200]   basically to build it.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:01.880]   You could build it with a company and a university.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.160]   - So same kind of design,
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:05.400]   but now using the superconducting magnets.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:07.200]   - Yeah, and if in fact, if you look at it,
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:10.680]   it's like, if you just expand the size of it,
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:13.240]   they're like, they look almost identical to each other
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.400]   because it's based on the,
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.000]   and actually that comes for a reason by the way,
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.440]   is that it also looks like a bigger version
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.160]   of the tokamak that we ran at MIT for 20 years,
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.840]   where we established the scientific benefits,
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.280]   in fact, of these higher magnetic fields.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.000]   So that's the pathway that we're on.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]   So I always say, so what does this mean?
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000]   The context is different because it was made,
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.600]   because it's primarily being made
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.640]   by a private sector company spun out of MIT,
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:43.880]   because the way that it raised money
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.400]   and the purpose of the entity, which is there,
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.740]   is to make commercial fusion power plants,
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:51.240]   not just to make a scientific experiment.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:52.680]   This is actually why we have,
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.440]   it's why we have a partnership, right?
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.360]   Is that our purpose at MIT
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360]   is not to commercialize directly,
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.560]   but boy, do we want to advance the technology
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.080]   and the science that comes along this,
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:05.360]   and that's the reason we're sort of doing it together.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.920]   - So it's MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:10.320]   So what's interesting to say about financing?
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.920]   And this seems like, from a scientific perspective,
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.280]   maybe not an interesting topic,
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.840]   but it's perhaps an extremely interesting topic.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.200]   I mean, you can just look at the tension
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:22.320]   between SpaceX and NASA, for example.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.920]   It's just clear that there's different financing mechanisms
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.900]   that can actually significantly accelerate
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:32.080]   the development of science and engineering.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.440]   - It's great that you brought that up.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.160]   We use several historic analogs,
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.560]   and one of them is around SpaceX,
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.200]   which is an appropriate one because space,
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.160]   putting things into orbit has a minimum size to it
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.040]   and integrated technological complexity
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.120]   and budget and things like this.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.000]   So our point when we were talking about starting
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.820]   a fusion commercialization company,
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.240]   people look at you like,
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:01.160]   isn't this still really just a science experiment?
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.280]   But one of the things that we pointed to was SpaceX
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.880]   to say, well, tell me like 25 years ago,
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.320]   how many people would have voted that, you know,
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:12.000]   the leading entity on the planet to put things into orbit,
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.200]   it's a private company.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.400]   People would have thought you were nutso, right?
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.240]   It's like, and what is interesting about SpaceX
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.440]   is that it proved it's more than actually just financing.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.600]   It's really the purpose of the organization.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.400]   So the purpose of a, and I'm not against public finance
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:33.640]   or anything like that, but the purpose of a public entity
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   like NASA correctly, you know, speaks to the political,
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.600]   because the cost comes from the political, you know,
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.160]   assembly that is there, and I guess from us eventually
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.400]   as well too, but its purpose wasn't about like making
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.920]   a commercial product.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.560]   It's about fundamental discovery and so forth,
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.360]   which is all really great.
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.840]   It's like, why did SpaceX, it's interesting,
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.960]   why did SpaceX succeed so well is because the idea was,
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.280]   it's like the focus that comes in the idea that you're going
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.920]   to relentlessly like reduce cost and increase efficiency
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.440]   is a drive that comes from the commercial aspect of it,
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.260]   right, and this also then changes the people in the teams,
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.000]   which are doing as well too, and in fact,
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.160]   trickles throughout the whole thing because the purpose
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:29.320]   isn't, while you're advancing things,
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:31.480]   like it's really good that we can put things in orbit
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.020]   a lot more cheaply, like it advances science,
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.760]   which is an interesting synergy, right?
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.500]   And it's the same thing that we think is gonna happen
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.720]   in fusion, that namely, this is a bootstrap effect
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.860]   that actually, that when you start to push yourself
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:47.880]   to think about near-term commercialization,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.640]   it like allows the science to get in hand faster,
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.840]   which then allows the commercialization to go faster,
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.500]   and up we go.
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.600]   By the way, we've seen this also in another,
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:00.560]   again, you have to watch out with analogies
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.840]   'cause they only can go so far, but like biotech
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.640]   is another one, like you look at the Human Genome Project,
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:09.960]   which was, it's sort of like, to me,
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:12.880]   that's like mapping the human genome is like,
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.520]   like that we can make net energy from fusion,
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:19.000]   like it's one of those like in your drawer that you go,
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.680]   this is a significant achievement by humanity,
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:25.800]   right, in this century, and there's the Human Genome Project
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.920]   fully government funded, it's gonna take 20, 25 years
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.480]   'cause we basically know the technology,
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:34.560]   we're just gonna be really diligent, keep going,
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:37.600]   da, da, da, and then all of a sudden, what comes along?
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.300]   Disruptive technology, right?
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.840]   You can sequence, you know, shotgun sequencing
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.240]   and computer recognition patterns, and basically,
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:51.200]   oh, I can do this 100 times faster, like wow, right?
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:54.800]   So that's really the, you know, to me,
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.920]   the story about why we started,
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.680]   why we launched Commonwealth Fusion Systems
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:03.080]   was more than just about another source of funding,
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.520]   which it is a different source of funding
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.880]   'cause it comes, it's also a different purpose,
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.120]   which is very important.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:10.960]   - But there's also something about a mechanism
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.600]   that creates culture, so giving power to like a young
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.920]   student, ambitious student to have a tremendous impact
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:22.260]   on the progress of nuclear fusion creates a culture
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:24.360]   that actually makes progress more aggressively,
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:27.800]   like you said, when seven nations collaborate,
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.840]   it gives more incentive to the bureaucracy
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.680]   to slow things down, to kind of have,
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   let's first have a discussion, and certainly don't give
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.840]   voice to the young, ambitious minds
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.920]   that are really pushing stuff forward.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.640]   And there's something about like the private sector
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:46.640]   that rewards, encourages, inspires young minds
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:50.640]   to say in the most beautiful of ways, F you to the--
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.040]   (laughing)
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:53.680]   - It is, it is a lot. - To the boss.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:54.720]   - Yeah, yeah. - To say like,
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.400]   we'll make it faster, we'll make it simpler,
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.960]   we'll make it better, we'll make it cheaper.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.960]   - Yeah, and sometimes that brashness doesn't bear out,
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.840]   you know, that's an aspect that you just take
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:04.600]   a different risk profile as well too,
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.880]   but you're right, it's this, you know, of the,
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:10.280]   I mean, it was interesting, our own trajectory
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:13.580]   at the fusion center was like we were pushed
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:16.280]   into this place by necessity as well too
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:19.120]   because I told you we have, and we had operated
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.520]   for a long time a tokamak on the MIT campus,
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.720]   achieved these world records,
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.760]   like 100 million degree plasma and stuff,
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:28.780]   like wow, this is fantastic.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:32.240]   But, you know, somewhat ironically I have to say
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.480]   is that it was like, oh, but we're not,
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.520]   this isn't the future of fusion anymore,
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.120]   like we're not, we're just gonna stop with small projects
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.700]   'cause it's too small, right?
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:43.880]   So we need to really move on to these much bigger projects
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.880]   'cause that's really the future of fusion.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:49.760]   And so it was defunded and this basically put at risk,
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.680]   like we were going to essentially lose MIT
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.120]   in the ecosystem, really a fusion,
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:58.200]   both from the research but also clearly important
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.320]   from the educational part of it.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.880]   So we, you know, we pushed back against this,
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:05.200]   we got a lifeline, we were able to go,
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:08.100]   and it was in this time scale that we basically
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.720]   came up with this idea, it's like, we should do this.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.240]   And in the end it was all of those,
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.040]   the people who were in the C level of the company
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:19.840]   were all literally students who got caught in that,
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.880]   they were PhD students at the time.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.880]   So you talk about enabling another generation,
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.400]   it's like, yeah, there you go, right?
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.320]   - So Spark gave-- - A lifeline.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:33.440]   - A lifeline, gave fuel to the future center at MIT
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.360]   that it continues. - But it's way more than that.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.680]   It wasn't just about like surviving
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.880]   for the sake of surviving, it was like,
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.200]   in the end for me it became like this,
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:44.380]   I remember the moment, you talk about these moments
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.520]   as a scientist and we were just like,
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.520]   we were working so hard about figuring out
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.240]   like, does this really, will this really work?
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:53.560]   Like, it's complex, like, does the magnet work?
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.160]   Does the interaction with the plasma work?
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:56.280]   Does all these things work?
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:59.080]   And it was just a grind, push, push, push, push.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:02.080]   And I remember the moment 'cause I was sitting
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.680]   in my office in Brookline and there was just like,
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:07.760]   I read like, and I was in, I don't know, whatever,
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.080]   the 20th or 40th slide or something into it.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.760]   And it was sort of that moment, like it just came together.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.440]   And I like, I couldn't even sit down
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.040]   'cause all it was just like, my wife was like,
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.960]   why are you walking around the apartment like this?
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.560]   Like, I just couldn't, I said, it's going to work.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.800]   Like, it's going to work, like, holy cow.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.280]   That moment of realization is like, kind of amazing.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:31.680]   But it also brings the responsibility of making it work.
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.520]   - Yeah, how do you make it work?
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.080]   So, you mean like that magic realization
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:39.080]   that you can have this modern magnet technology
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.540]   and you can actually, like, why do we need to work
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:43.000]   with ITER, we can do it here?
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.820]   - Yeah, yeah, but it's interesting that ITER is,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.920]   that one of the reasons that like,
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.440]   we started with a group of six of us at MIT.
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.240]   And then once we got some funding
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.480]   through the establishment of the company,
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.160]   it became a slightly larger.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.360]   But in the end, we had a rather small team.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.760]   Like, this was like a team of, you know,
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:05.680]   order of like 20 to 25 people designed Spark
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.800]   in like about two years, right?
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:09.880]   How does that happen?
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.720]   Well, we're clever, but you have to give ITER
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.200]   its due here as well too.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.080]   Again, this is an aspect always of the bootstrap up.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.000]   Like, I go back to the Human Genome Project.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.560]   So, modern day genomics would not be possible
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:25.760]   without the underlying basis that came
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.360]   from setting that up.
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.240]   It had to be there.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.800]   It had to be curiosity driven public program.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.120]   It's the same with ITER, but because we had the tools
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:35.600]   that were there to understand ITER,
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.740]   we also had the tools to understand Spark.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:41.440]   So, we parlayed those in an extremely powerful way
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.720]   to be able to tell us about what was going to happen.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.240]   So, these things are never simple, right?
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.360]   It's like people look at this, go,
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.000]   "Oh, this means we should, like,
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.620]   "should we really have a public-based program about fusion
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:52.320]   "or should we have it all in the private?"
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.440]   It's like, no, the answer is neither way
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.680]   because in all these complex technologies,
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.360]   you have to keep pushing on all the fronts
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.120]   to actually get it there.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:02.360]   - So, you know, the natural question when people hear
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:05.080]   breakthrough with the inertial confinement,
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.980]   with the magnetic confinement is,
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:10.880]   so, when will we have commercial reactors,
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:13.720]   power plants that are actually producing electricity?
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.840]   What's your sense looking out into the future?
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.960]   When do you think you can envision a future
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:22.920]   where we have actual electricity coming from nuclear fusion?
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.840]   - Partly driven by us, but in other places as well, too.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.440]   So, there's the advent, what's so different now
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.080]   than three or four years ago.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.780]   Like, we launched around four years ago.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:38.040]   What's so different now is the advent of a very nascent,
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.040]   but seemingly robust, commercial fusion endeavor.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:45.720]   So, it's not just Commonwealth Fusion Systems.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.000]   There's something like 20-plus companies.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.120]   - So, there's a sector now.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.560]   - There's a sector.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.840]   They actually have something called
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.360]   the Fusion Industry Association,
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.560]   which if your viewers wanna go see this,
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.080]   this describes the different,
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.160]   and they've got this plethora of approaches.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:02.080]   Like, I haven't even described all the approaches.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.480]   I've basically described the mainline approaches.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:07.920]   And they're all at varying degrees of technical
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.920]   and scientific maturity with very huge,
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:13.280]   different balances between them.
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.400]   But what they share is that because they're going out
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.120]   and getting funding from the private sector,
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.040]   is that their stated goals are about getting fusion
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.040]   into place so that both it meets the investors' demands,
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.880]   which are interesting, right, and the timescales of that,
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.560]   but also it's like, well, there's gonna, and why?
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.280]   It's because it's easy.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.680]   There's this enormous push, driver,
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:42.160]   about getting carbon-free energy sources
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:43.240]   out into the market.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.360]   And whoever figures those out is going to be both very,
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:49.080]   it's gonna be very important geopolitically,
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.440]   but also economically as well too.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.520]   So, it's a different kind of bet, I guess,
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.760]   or a different kind of gamble
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:58.080]   that you're taking with fusion,
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.560]   but it's so disruptive that it's like,
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.080]   there's essentially a class of investors and teams
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.400]   that are ready to go after it as well too.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.320]   So, what do they share in this?
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.520]   They typically share getting after fusion on a timescale
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.760]   so that could it have any relevance
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:18.000]   towards climate change, battling climate change.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.200]   And I would say this is difficult,
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.520]   but it's fairly easy 'cause it's math.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.560]   So, what you do is you actually go to some target,
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.920]   like 2050 or 2060, something like this,
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:30.600]   and say, I wanna be blank percent of the world's market
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.120]   of electricity or something like that.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.320]   And we know historically what it takes to evolve
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.120]   and distribute these kinds of technologies
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.920]   'cause every technology takes some period of time,
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:42.600]   so-called S curve, it's basically,
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.120]   everything follows a logarithmic curve,
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.280]   exponential type curve,
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.160]   it's a straight line, a log plot.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:51.320]   And like you look at wind, solar, fission,
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.680]   they all follow the same thing.
[02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.800]   So, it's easy, you take that curve and you go,
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:56.520]   that's slope and you work backwards.
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:59.160]   And you go, if you don't start in the early 2030s,
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:03.720]   like, it's not gonna have a significant impact
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.680]   by that time.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:07.160]   So, all of them share this idea.
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:09.280]   And in fact, it's not just the companies now,
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.960]   the US federal government has a program
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:14.200]   that was started last year that said,
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.000]   we should be looking to try to get like the first,
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.120]   and what do I mean by, like, what does it mean to start?
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.080]   That you've got something that's putting electricity
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.160]   on the grid, a pilot, what we call it.
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.880]   And if that can get started, like in the early 2030s,
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.200]   the idea of ramping it up, you know, makes sense.
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.640]   That's math, right?
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:34.880]   So, that's the ambition, then the question is,
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.280]   and actually this is different
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.360]   because the government program,
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:39.800]   and they vary around in this.
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:42.680]   So, for example, the United Kingdom's government idea
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.520]   was to get the first one on by 2040.
[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:50.000]   And China has ambitions probably middle 2030s,
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.240]   or maybe a little bit later.
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:55.320]   And Europe, you know, continental Europe,
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:58.120]   is a little bit, I'm not exactly sure where it is,
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.760]   but it's like later, it's like 2050 or 2060,
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:03.760]   'cause it's mostly linked to the Eater timeline as well too.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.800]   The fusion companies, which makes sense,
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.760]   it's like, of course they've got
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:09.000]   the most aggressive timelines.
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.840]   It's like, we're gonna map the human genome faster
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.080]   as well too, right?
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.480]   So, it's interesting about where we are.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.000]   And I think, you know, we're not all the way there,
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.280]   but my intuition tells me we're probably gonna have
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:23.960]   a couple of cracks at it actually on that timeline.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.200]   So, this is where we have to be careful though,
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.080]   you say commercial fusion.
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.320]   You know, what does that mean?
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.200]   Commercial fusion to me means that you're actually
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:36.120]   have a known quantity about what it costs,
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:38.760]   what it costs to build, and what it costs to operate,
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.480]   the reliability of putting energy on the grid.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.320]   That's commercial fusion.
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:46.160]   So, it turns out that that's not necessarily
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.320]   exactly the first fusion devices
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.560]   that put electricity on the grid,
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:51.000]   'cause you gotta, there's a learning curve
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.600]   to get like better and better at it.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:56.720]   But that's probably, I would suspect,
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:59.240]   the biggest hurdle is to get to the first one.
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:01.720]   - The work I've done, the work I continue to do
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.840]   with autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles,
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.080]   there's an interesting parallel there
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.200]   where a bunch of companies announced a deadline
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:10.880]   for themselves in 2020, '21, '22,
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.480]   and only a small subset of those companies
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.920]   have actually really pushed that forward.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:19.420]   There's Google with Waymo, or Alphabet rather,
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.040]   and then there's Tesla with semi-autonomous driving
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:27.440]   in their autopilot, full self-driving mode.
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:30.800]   And those are different approaches.
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.800]   So, Tesla's achieving much, much higher scale,
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:38.440]   but the quality of the drive is semi-autonomous.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.080]   I don't know if there's a metaphor or an analogy here.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.200]   And then there's Waymo that's focusing
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.360]   on very specific cities, but achieving real,
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.700]   full autonomy with actual passengers,
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:50.260]   but the scale is much smaller.
[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:52.220]   So, I wonder, just like you said,
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:53.640]   there would be these kinds of similar
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.400]   kind of really hard pushes.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.240]   - Absolutely.
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.800]   So, actually, this is why I'm encouraged about Fusion.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.680]   So, Fusion's still hard, let's let everyone be clear,
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.000]   because of the science underneath it
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.120]   of achieving the right conditions for the plasma
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.920]   basically is a yardstick that you have
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:13.640]   to put up against all of them.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:16.040]   What's encouraging that I see in this,
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.280]   and it's actually what happens when you sort of
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:20.620]   let loose the creativity of this,
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.740]   is maybe I'll go back to first principles.
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:27.100]   So, Fusion is also a fairly strange,
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:29.260]   so if you think about building a coal plant,
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:31.780]   like burning wood and coal and gas
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:34.020]   is actually not that much different from each other,
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:36.540]   because they're kind of about the same physical conditions,
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:37.860]   and you get the fuel and you light it,
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:40.900]   and the Fusion is very, remember I told you
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.440]   that there's this condition of the temperature,
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.360]   which is kind of universal.
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:47.020]   But if you take the density of the fuel
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.640]   between magnetic Fusion and inertial Fusion,
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:52.960]   they're different by about a factor of 10 billion.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.620]   So, this, and the density of the fuel really matters,
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:56.460]   and actually, so does the,
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:58.020]   and this means the energy confinement time
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:00.740]   is also different by a factor of 10 billion as well too,
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.360]   because it's the product of those two.
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.960]   So, one's really dense and short-lived,
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.420]   and the other one's really long-lived
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:09.560]   and actually under-dense as well too.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:14.560]   So, what that means is that the way to get
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.900]   the underlying physical state is so different
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:19.740]   among these different approaches,
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:23.020]   what it lends itself to is, does this mean
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:26.220]   that eventual commercial products will actually
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:29.020]   fill different needs in the energy system?
[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:31.220]   So, it sort of goes to your comment about,
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:35.380]   I have to suspect this, because anything
[02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:38.520]   that is high-tech and is like a really important
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.760]   thing in our economy, tends to never find its way
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:44.260]   as one, only one manifestation.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:46.580]   Like, look at transportation as well too.
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:51.060]   We have scooters, Vespas, you know,
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.740]   overland trucks, cars, electric cars,
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:54.580]   of course we have these,
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.900]   because they meet different demands in it.
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.420]   So, what's interesting, you know,
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.600]   that I find fascinating now is that we have,
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.020]   in fusion, it's going to look like that,
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:06.100]   that probably there's, while the near-term
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:08.340]   focus is on electricity production,
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:10.660]   there might even be different kinds of markets
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:12.940]   that actually make sense in some places,
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:15.660]   less than others, it comes to trade-offs,
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.540]   'cause we haven't really talked about the engineering yet,
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.420]   but the engineering really matters,
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:22.340]   like to the operation of the device.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.000]   And so, it could be that, you know,
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.500]   I suspect what we'll end up with is several
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:30.020]   different configurations which have different features,
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:33.420]   which are trade-offs, basically, in the energy market.
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:36.140]   - What do you see as the major engineering
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:39.180]   or general hurdles that are in the way?
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.660]   - Yeah.
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:43.340]   So, the first one is just the cost
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:46.300]   of building a single unit.
[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:48.700]   So, fusion has, and it's actually interesting,
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.980]   you talked about the different models that you have.
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:55.900]   So, fusion has, one of its interesting limitations
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.420]   is that it's very hard, almost at some point
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:01.340]   it becomes physically impossible to actually
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.300]   make small power units, like a kilowatt,
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:07.180]   a thousand watts, you know, which is like
[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:08.740]   a personal home, like, you know,
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:10.220]   this is about a thousand watts,
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.140]   or your personal use of electricity
[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:15.220]   is about like a thousand watts.
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:19.940]   This is basically impossible for a single unit to do this.
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:22.540]   So, like, you're not gonna have a fusion
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.780]   like power plant, like as your furnace
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:27.300]   or your electric heater in your home.
[02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.580]   And the reason for this comes from the fact
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:32.380]   that fusion relies on it being,
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:34.100]   it's not just that it's very hot,
[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:36.660]   it's that the fusion power is the heating source
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.500]   to keep it hot.
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:40.820]   So, if you go too small, it basically
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.020]   just cannot keep it hot.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:45.060]   So, it's interesting is that this,
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.300]   so this is one of the hard parts.
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:48.740]   So, this means that the individual units,
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:51.420]   you know, and it varies from concept to concept,
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:55.580]   but the National Academy's report that came out last year
[02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:58.620]   sort of put the benchmark as being like,
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.820]   probably the minimum size looks like
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:03.380]   around 50 million watts of electricity,
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:06.180]   which is like enough for like a small to,
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.700]   you know, mid-sized city actually.
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:13.300]   So, that is, so that's sort of like a scale challenge.
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:15.780]   And in fact, it's one of the reasons why
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:18.180]   in Commonwealth and in other private sector ones,
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:21.220]   like, they try to push this down actually
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:23.740]   of trying to get to these smaller units,
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.860]   just 'cause it reduces the cost of it.
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:30.460]   Then probably, obviously, I would say,
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.980]   it's an obvious one, like achieving the fusion state
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:36.100]   itself and high gain is a hard one.
[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:37.100]   But we already talked about.
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.220]   What kind of hurdle, what kind of challenge is that?
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.820]   That's achieving the right temperature,
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:42.780]   density, and energy confinement time
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:45.420]   in the fuel itself, in the plasma itself.
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:48.980]   And so, some of the configurations
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:51.740]   which are being chosen are actually,
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:54.140]   have quite a ways to go, in fact, of seeing those.
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:57.500]   But what their consideration is, oh, yes,
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:59.940]   but by our particular configuration,
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.940]   the engineering simplicity confers
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:04.180]   like an economic advantage, even if we're behind
[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.820]   in sort of an assigned sense, okay, which is fine.
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:10.540]   This is also what you get when you get an explosion
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:11.740]   in the private sector.
[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:13.500]   You basically are distributing risks
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:15.700]   in different ways, right, which makes sense.
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:19.180]   All of that good, so what I would say
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:22.500]   is that the next hurdle to really overcome
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.980]   is about making that electricity.
[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:28.540]   So, like, we need to see a unit or several units,
[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.060]   like using fusion in some way to put
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:33.620]   a meaningful amount of energy on the grid.
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:36.820]   Because this starts giving us real answers
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.540]   as to like what this is going to look like.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:41.660]   The full end-to-end process.
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:43.060]   The full end-to-end thing.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:44.660]   So, Commonwealth's goal is that,
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:46.780]   I'll just comment to Commonwealth
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:48.380]   'cause I'll take some, you know,
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.780]   I guess some credit for this, is that
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:53.900]   the origins of Commonwealth were, in fact,
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:55.460]   in examining that.
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:58.020]   Like, we could see this new technology coming forward,
[02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:00.180]   this new superconducting material,
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.260]   and the origins of our thought process
[02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:04.780]   were really around designing, effectively,
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:06.740]   the pilot plant or the commercial unit.
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:08.820]   It's called ARC, which is actually
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.780]   the step forward after SPARC.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:12.780]   And that was the origins of it.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:14.380]   So, all the things that were other parts
[02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:16.580]   of the plan, like SPARC and the magnet,
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:19.420]   were actually all informed totally
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:20.780]   by building something that was gonna
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:22.740]   put net electricity on the grid.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:24.300]   And the timing of that, we still hope,
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:25.980]   is actually the early 2030s.
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:28.300]   - So, SPARC is the design of the Takamak
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.340]   and ARC is the actual full end-to-end thing.
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:31.660]   - Is like a thing that actually puts
[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:32.700]   that energy on the grid.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.100]   So, SPARC is named intentionally,
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:38.300]   that it's on for a short period of time,
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:41.140]   and it doesn't have a, it has, yeah,
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:43.780]   it's the spark of the fusion revolution
[02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:46.940]   or something like that, I guess we could call it.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:50.820]   Yeah, so those are sort of the programmatic
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:52.060]   challenges of doing that.
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:57.060]   And you talked about SpaceX, so what has
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:00.020]   evolved even in the last year or so was,
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:03.580]   in fact, in March of 2022, the White House
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:06.260]   announced that it was going to start a program
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:08.660]   that kind of looks like a SpaceX analogy,
[02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:11.460]   that namely, wow, we've got these things
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:13.380]   in the private sector, we should leverage
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.100]   the private sector and the advantages
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.740]   of what they obtain, but also with the things,
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:20.540]   like this is gonna be hard, it's gonna take
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:23.060]   quite a bit of financing, so why don't we set up
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:25.780]   a program where we don't really get in the way
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:27.340]   of the private sector fusion companies,
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:29.580]   but we help them finance these difficult things,
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:32.300]   which is how SpaceX basically became successful
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:34.660]   through the COTS program, fantastic, right?
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:36.140]   And that's evolving as well, too,
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:39.940]   so the fusion ecosystem is almost unrecognizable
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:41.860]   from where it was like five years ago
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:42.900]   around those things.
[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:47.460]   - How important is it for the heads of the companies
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:48.860]   that are working on nuclear fusion
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:51.620]   to have a Twitter account and to be quite,
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:52.860]   you said you don't use Twitter--
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:54.780]   - I don't use Twitter. - Very much.
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:57.140]   I mean, there is some element to,
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:58.860]   and I don't think this should be discounted,
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:02.740]   whatever you think about figures like Jeff Bezos
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:05.620]   with Blue Origin or Elon Musk with SpaceX.
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:10.620]   There is a science communication, to put it in nice terms,
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:15.300]   that's kind of required to really educate the public
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:18.460]   and get everybody excited and sell the sexiness of it.
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.460]   I mean, just even the videos of SpaceX,
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:23.020]   just being able to kind of get everybody excited
[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:25.060]   about going out to space once again.
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.860]   I mean, there's all kinds of different ways of doing that,
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.980]   but I guess that's what companies do well,
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:32.740]   is to advertise themselves, to really sell themselves.
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.580]   - It is, yeah.
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:36.740]   Well, actually, I feel like one of the reasons
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:40.940]   on this podcast, and so I don't have an official role
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:43.940]   in the company, and one of the reasons for this
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:48.180]   was also that it's interesting 'cause when you come from,
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:50.420]   like you're running a company, it makes sense,
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:53.100]   they're promoting their own product and their own vision,
[02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:54.940]   which totally makes sense,
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:58.660]   but there's also a very important role for academics
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:00.900]   who have knowledge about what's going on,
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:03.540]   but are sufficiently distant from it
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:06.260]   that they're not fully only self-motivated
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:09.180]   just by their own projects or so forth.
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:13.420]   And for me, this is, I mean, we see particularly
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:16.200]   the problems of the distrust in technology,
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.060]   and then honestly in the scientific community as well too.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:25.100]   It will be one of the greatest tragedies, I would say,
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:28.060]   that if we go through all of this and almost pull off
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:30.700]   what looks like a miracle, like technologic
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:33.860]   and scientific-wise, which is to make a fusion power plant,
[02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:37.300]   and then nobody wants to use it because they feel
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:39.980]   that they don't trust the people who are doing it
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.500]   or the technology.
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:44.680]   So we have to get so far out ahead of this.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.220]   So I give lots of public lectures or things like this
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:51.660]   of accessing a larger range of people.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:53.340]   We're not trying to hide anything.
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:57.020]   You can come and see, come do tours of our laboratory.
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:59.100]   In fact, I want to set those up virtually as well too.
[02:18:59.100 --> 02:19:02.140]   You might look at our Plasma Science and Fusion Center
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:02.980]   YouTube channel.
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:04.980]   So we are reaching out through those mediums,
[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:07.460]   and it's really important that we do those things.
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:09.740]   But it's also, but also then realizing,
[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:12.940]   setting up the realistic expectations of what we need to do.
[02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:15.020]   We're not there.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:17.340]   We don't have commercial fusion devices yet.
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:19.860]   And you asked, like, what are the challenges?
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.020]   I'm not gonna get into any deep technical questions
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:25.700]   about what the challenges are, but it is,
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:31.380]   the pathway, not just to make fusion work technically,
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:34.380]   but to make it economically competitive and viable
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:36.860]   so that it's actually used out in the private sector
[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:38.900]   is a non-trivial task.
[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:41.980]   And it's because of the newness of it.
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:46.180]   Like, we're simultaneously trying to evolve the technology
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:49.180]   and make it economically viable at the same time.
[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:52.940]   Those are two difficult coupled tasks.
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.660]   So my own research and my own drive right now
[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:00.540]   is that fantastic Commonwealth Fusion Systems is set up.
[02:20:00.540 --> 02:20:03.860]   We have a commercialization unit of that particular kind,
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.700]   which is gonna drive forward a token back.
[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:08.380]   In fact, I was just, there's discussions,
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:10.700]   or there's dialogues going on around the world
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.660]   with other kinds of ones, like stellarators,
[02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:15.060]   which prefer different kinds of challenges
[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:16.700]   and economic advantages.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:19.140]   But what we have to, I know what we have to have.
[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:22.980]   What we have to have is a new generation
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:26.180]   of integrated scientists, technologists, and engineers
[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.180]   that understand, like, how, what needs to get done
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:31.220]   to get all the way to the goal line.
[02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:32.460]   'Cause we don't have them now.
[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:33.660]   - So like a multidisciplinary team.
[02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:34.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:36.820]   - What's required, I mean, you've spoken about,
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.020]   you've said that fusion is, quote,
[02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:44.060]   "The most multidisciplinary field you can imagine."
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:45.100]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:45.940]   - Why is that?
[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:46.780]   What are the differences?
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:49.900]   - Well, 'cause most of our discussion that we've had so far
[02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:52.140]   is really like a physics discussion, really.
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:57.140]   So don't neglect physics as at the origin of this.
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:20:59.860]   But already we touched on plasma physics
[02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:03.420]   and nuclear physics, which are basically two,
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.100]   somewhat overlap, but independent disciplines.
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:08.300]   Then when it comes to the engineering,
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:09.420]   it's almost everything.
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:10.900]   So why is this?
[02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:14.100]   Well, let's build an electromagnet together, okay?
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:15.020]   What is this gonna take?
[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:18.220]   It's gonna take, it's basically electrical engineering,
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:21.540]   computer, so you understand how it goes together,
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:24.420]   what happens, computational engineering
[02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:27.300]   to model this very complex integrated thing,
[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:31.020]   materials engineering, because you're pushing materials
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:34.100]   to their limit with respect to stress and so forth.
[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:35.980]   Takes cryogenic engineering, which is sort of
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:37.620]   a subdiscipline, but cooling things
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:39.460]   to extremely low temperatures.
[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:40.660]   - Probably some kind of chemistry thing
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:41.500]   in there too.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.460]   - Well, actually, yeah, which tends to show up
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:44.300]   in the materials.
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:46.300]   And that's just one of the subcomponents of it.
[02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:49.260]   Like almost everything gets hit in this, right?
[02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:52.580]   So you're, and you're also in a very integrated environment
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.860]   because in the end, all of these things,
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:57.940]   while you isolate them from each other in a physics sense,
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:00.500]   in an engineering sense, they all have to work
[02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:02.220]   like seamlessly together.
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:05.980]   So it's one of those, I mean, in my own career,
[02:22:05.980 --> 02:22:10.140]   I've basically done atomic physics, spectroscopy,
[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:13.940]   plasma physics, ion etching.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:18.100]   So this includes material science,
[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:23.500]   something called MHD, magnetohydrodynamics.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:26.660]   And now all the way through, like, I'm not even sure
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:28.140]   how many different careers I've had.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:32.100]   It's also, by the way, this is also a recruiting stage
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:34.140]   for like young scientists thinking to come in.
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.700]   Like my comment to scientists, if you're bored in fusion,
[02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:38.660]   you're not paying attention, 'cause there's always
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:41.660]   something interesting to go and do.
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:45.500]   So that's a really important part of what we're doing,
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.260]   which isn't new in fusion, actually,
[02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:50.900]   and in fact is in the roots of what we've done at MIT.
[02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:55.140]   But holy cow, like the proximity of possibility
[02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:57.820]   of commercial fusion is the new thing.
[02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:00.580]   So my catchphrase is, like, you may be wondering,
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.340]   like, why weren't we doing all these things?
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.780]   Like, why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:07.860]   and new materials and new methods of heat extraction
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:08.700]   and so forth?
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:11.140]   Because everybody knew fusion was 40 years away.
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:13.500]   And now it's four years away.
[02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:17.340]   - There is a history, like you said, 40, 30, whatever,
[02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:18.820]   that kind of old joke.
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:23.820]   There's a history of fusion projects that, you know,
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:26.540]   are characterized by cost overruns and delays.
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:27.700]   - Yeah.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.820]   - How do you avoid this?
[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:30.500]   How do you minimize the chance of this?
[02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:34.660]   - You have to build great teams, is one of them.
[02:23:34.660 --> 02:23:37.260]   It tends to be that the smaller,
[02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:39.620]   there's sort of an, I'm not an expert in this,
[02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:41.580]   but I've seen this enough integrated engineering teams.
[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:42.780]   - Is there any equations?
[02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.620]   - Yeah, well, there's almost,
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:45.940]   I've seen this from enough teams.
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:48.740]   Like, I've seen also the futility of lone geniuses
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:50.420]   trying to solve everything by themselves.
[02:23:50.420 --> 02:23:51.500]   Like, no.
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:54.340]   But also organizations that have 10,000 people in them
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.540]   is just not, doesn't lend itself at all to innovation.
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:24:00.100]   So like one of our original sponsors
[02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:01.380]   and a good friend, Vinod Khosla,
[02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:03.020]   I don't know if you've ever talked to Vinod Khosla.
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:06.260]   He's a venture, he's got fantastic ideas
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.180]   about like the right sizes of teams
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:10.380]   and things that really innovate, right?
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:13.020]   And there is an optimum place in there
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.660]   is that you get enough cross discipline and ideas,
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:17.700]   but it doesn't become so overly bureaucratic
[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:19.420]   that you can't execute on it.
[02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:21.580]   So one of the ways,
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:23.380]   and this was one of the challenges of Fusion
[02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:25.900]   is that everything was leading towards,
[02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:30.300]   like, I have to have like enormously large teams
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.980]   just to execute because of the scale of the project.
[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:37.020]   The fact that now through both technology
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:40.100]   and I would argue financing innovation,
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:43.460]   we're driving to the point where it's smaller focused teams
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:44.420]   about doing those things.
[02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:46.620]   So that's one way to make it faster.
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:49.740]   The other way to make it faster is modularize the problem
[02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:51.340]   or parse the problem.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:54.140]   So this is the other difficulty in Fusion
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:56.500]   is that you tend to look at this as like,
[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:59.020]   oh, it's really just about making the plasma
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:00.660]   into this state, you know, here,
[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:02.260]   that you get this energy gain.
[02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:04.460]   No, because in the end,
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:08.060]   if you can parse out the different problems of making that
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:09.620]   and then make it as separate as possible
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:10.900]   from extracting the energy
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:12.380]   and then converting it into electricity,
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:13.980]   the more separate those are,
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:16.140]   the better they are because you get parallel paths
[02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:17.900]   that basically mitigate risk.
[02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:19.260]   This is not new in Fusion, by the way,
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.940]   and this is the way that we attack
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:22.980]   most complex technological,
[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:26.340]   you know, integrated technological challenges.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:30.020]   - Have you by any chance seen some of the application
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:32.180]   of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning,
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:35.860]   DeepMind has a nice paper, has a nice effort
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.980]   on basically using reinforcement learning
[02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:40.380]   for a learned control algorithm
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:42.260]   for controlling nuclear fusion.
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:44.940]   Do you find those kinds of,
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:46.420]   I guess you throw them under the umbrella
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:47.940]   of computational modeling.
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:50.780]   Do you find those interesting, promising directions?
[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:51.980]   - They're all interesting.
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:55.180]   So when people, you know, I'll pull back,
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:57.340]   maybe a natural question is like,
[02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:58.860]   why is it different in Fusion?
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:00.540]   Like there's a long history to Fusion, right?
[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:02.260]   It was going on for, like I told you,
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:04.380]   like stories from the late 1960s,
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:06.500]   like what's different now, right?
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:10.020]   So I think from the technology point of view,
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:11.940]   there's two massive things which are different.
[02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:14.100]   So one of them, you know, I'll be parochial,
[02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:16.460]   it's the advent of this new superconducting materials
[02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:20.020]   because the most mature ways that we understand
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:21.740]   about how we're gonna get to fusion power plants
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:22.580]   are magnetic fusion.
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:24.620]   And by the fact that you've got access
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:28.100]   to something which like changes the economic equation
[02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:29.940]   by an over an order of magnitude
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:31.580]   is just a totally, you know,
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:33.180]   and that wasn't that long ago,
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:34.900]   it was only September of 2021
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:36.700]   that we actually demonstrated the technology.
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.460]   That changes the prospects there.
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:41.300]   And the other one is computing
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:43.220]   and it's across the whole spectrum.
[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:46.100]   It's not just in control of the Fusion device,
[02:26:46.100 --> 02:26:48.740]   it's actually in the, we actually use machine learning
[02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:51.100]   and things like this in the design of the magnet itself.
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.340]   It's an incredibly complex design space.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:55.620]   So you use those tools.
[02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:59.100]   The simulation of the plasma itself is actually,
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:02.060]   we're at a totally different place than we were
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:02.900]   because of those things.
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:06.260]   So those are the two big drivers that I see actually
[02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:08.380]   that make it different.
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:09.860]   And actually, and it's interesting,
[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:12.700]   both those things self-enforce
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:13.940]   about what you asked about before,
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.700]   like how do you avoid delays and things?
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:18.260]   Well, it's by having smaller teams
[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:20.140]   that can actually execute on those.
[02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:23.980]   But now you can do this because the new magnets
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:26.100]   make the devices all smaller
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:29.140]   and the computing means your human effectiveness
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:32.340]   about exploring the optimization space is way better.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:34.180]   It's like, they're all interlinked to each other.
[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:35.900]   Plus the modularization, like you said,
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.620]   and it's everything just kind of works together
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:40.060]   to make smaller teams more effective, move faster.
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:42.740]   And it's actually, and it's through that learned experience.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:45.740]   I mean, of the things that I'm the most proud of
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:48.620]   about what came out, in fact, the origins of thinking
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:49.700]   about how we would use
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:53.180]   the high temperature superconducting magnets
[02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:56.580]   came out of my design class at MIT.
[02:27:56.580 --> 02:27:58.820]   And in the design class, like one of the features
[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:00.380]   that I kept, I mean, it was interesting,
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:02.380]   I actually learned, I really learned along
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.620]   with the students about this,
[02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:05.620]   but like this insistence on the features,
[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:09.300]   like we can't have so many coupled, integrated,
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:10.900]   hard technology developments.
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:12.900]   Like we have to separate these somehow.
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:14.620]   So we worked and worked and worked at this.
[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:17.860]   And in fact, that's what really, in my opinion,
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:19.980]   the greatest advantage of the arc design
[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:24.420]   and built into the Commonwealth Fusion System idea
[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:26.260]   is like to parse out the problems.
[02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:28.620]   Like how can we attack these in parallel?
[02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:32.020]   Yeah, and so it really comes to,
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:34.820]   we talked about philosophy, it's like a design philosophy.
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.620]   Like how do you attack these kinds of problems?
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:39.540]   And you do it like that.
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:41.020]   - And also, like you mentioned offline,
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:46.020]   that there's a power to, as part of a class,
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:48.660]   to design a nuclear fusion.
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:50.420]   - Well, it's...
[02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:51.260]   - Power plan.
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:52.080]   (laughing)
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:52.920]   - Well, it is...
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:53.740]   - And then make it a reality.
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:56.300]   - And it's hard to imagine a more powerful force
[02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:59.020]   than like 15 MIT PhD students,
[02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:01.980]   like working together towards solving a problem.
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:04.820]   And what I always, in fact, we just,
[02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:07.780]   we recently just taught the most recent,
[02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:10.900]   I say I teach it, I mean, I guide it actually,
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:12.220]   the most recent version of this,
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:13.860]   where they actually designed,
[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:15.820]   based on this National Academies report,
[02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:18.860]   they actually designed like a pilot plant
[02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:21.700]   that has basis and similarities to what we had done before.
[02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:24.340]   But I kept wanting to like push the envelope
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:25.180]   and where they are.
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:30.060]   It's like the creativity and the energy
[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:32.580]   that they bring to these things is kind of like,
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:35.980]   it keeps me going, like I'm not gonna retire anytime soon,
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:37.860]   when I keep seeing that kind of dedication,
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:40.580]   and it's wonderful around in that.
[02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:42.740]   It almost, not to overuse a,
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:46.260]   or to paraphrase something, right,
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:51.260]   which is that the famous quote by Margaret Mead,
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:55.820]   never doubt that a small group of dedicated persons
[02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:56.900]   will change the world.
[02:29:56.900 --> 02:29:59.780]   Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:01.500]   - I mean, that's just such a powerful
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:04.260]   and inspiring thing for an individual.
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:05.900]   Find the right team, be part of that,
[02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:07.940]   and then you, yourself, your passion,
[02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:10.420]   your efforts could actually make a big change,
[02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:11.260]   a big impact.
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:13.420]   I gotta ask you, so it's,
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:17.420]   it's a whole 'nother different conversation,
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:21.460]   I'm sure, to have, but nuclear power as it currently stands,
[02:30:21.460 --> 02:30:26.020]   so using fission is extremely safe,
[02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:27.260]   despite public perception.
[02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:28.860]   - It is the safest, actually.
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.540]   - So that's a whole 'nother conversation,
[02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:34.220]   but almost like a human, bureaucratic,
[02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:39.220]   physics, engineering question of what lessons do you draw
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:44.140]   from the catastrophic events
[02:30:44.140 --> 02:30:47.060]   where the power plants did fail,
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.780]   so Chernobyl and Three Mile Island,
[02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:50.380]   Chernobyl, what lessons do you draw?
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.220]   - Actually, Three Mile Island wasn't really a disaster,
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:53.420]   'cause nothing escaped from the thing,
[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:58.420]   but Chernobyl and Fukushima had obvious consequences
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:01.220]   in the populations that live nearby.
[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:03.780]   - What lesson do you draw from those
[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.860]   that you can carry forward to fusion?
[02:31:05.860 --> 02:31:08.380]   Now, I know there's, you can say that you're not gonna have
[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:11.260]   the same kind of issues, but it's possible that
[02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:13.580]   the same folks also said they're not gonna be,
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:15.180]   have those same kind of issues.
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:17.260]   We humans, the human factor,
[02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:19.420]   we haven't talked about that one quite as much,
[02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:20.380]   but it's still there.
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:24.520]   - So to be clear, so fusion has intrinsic safety
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:27.300]   with respect to it can't run away,
[02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.460]   those are physics bases.
[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:32.100]   Technology and engineering bases of running a,
[02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:34.700]   again, anything that makes large amounts of power
[02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:37.580]   and heats things up has got intrinsic safety in it,
[02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:40.060]   and by the fact that we actually produce
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:42.460]   very energetic particles, this doesn't mean
[02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:44.860]   that there's no radiation involved in,
[02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:47.940]   ionizing radiation to be more accurate.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:51.020]   In fusion, it's just that it's in a very different
[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:53.300]   order of magnitude, basically.
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:56.820]   So what are the lessons in fusion?
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:01.820]   So one of them is make sure that you're looking at aspects
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:07.500]   of the holistic environmental and societal footprint
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:09.460]   that the technology will have.
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:13.460]   As technologists, we tend not to focus on these,
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:15.780]   particularly in early stages of development.
[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:18.700]   Like we just want something that works, right?
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:21.020]   But if we come with just something that works,
[02:32:21.020 --> 02:32:24.440]   but doesn't actually satisfy the societal demands
[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:28.040]   for safety and for, I mean, we will have materials
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.900]   that we have to dispose of out of fusion,
[02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:33.220]   just this is, but there's technological questions
[02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:34.800]   about what that looks like.
[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:37.620]   So will this look like something that you have to
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:41.220]   put in the ground for 100 years or five years?
[02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:44.100]   And the consequences of those are both economic
[02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:46.300]   and societal acceptance and so forth,
[02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:47.500]   but don't bury those.
[02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:51.100]   Like bring these up front, talk to people about them,
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:53.740]   and make people realize that you're actually,
[02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.740]   the way I would look at it is that you're making fusion
[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:57.860]   more economically attractive by making it
[02:32:57.860 --> 02:33:00.500]   more societally acceptable as well too.
[02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:04.460]   And then realize is that, I think there's a few
[02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:06.900]   interesting boundaries, basically.
[02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:09.180]   So one of them, speaking of boundaries,
[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:12.860]   that successful fusion devices, I'm pretty sure
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:16.500]   will require that you don't have to have an evacuation
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:19.140]   plan for anybody who lives at the site boundary.
[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:23.980]   So this has implications for what we build
[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:26.140]   from a fusion engineering point of view,
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:29.020]   but has major implications for where you can site
[02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:30.880]   fusion devices, right?
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.900]   So in many ways, it becomes more like, well,
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:35.860]   we have fences around industrial heat sources
[02:33:35.860 --> 02:33:37.060]   and things like this for a reason, right?
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:38.420]   For personal safety.
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:40.180]   It looks more like that, right?
[02:33:40.180 --> 02:33:41.420]   It's not quite as simple as that,
[02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:43.140]   but that's what it should look like.
[02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:45.660]   And in fact, we have research projects going on right now
[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:48.700]   at MIT that are trying to push the technologies
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:50.780]   to make it more look like that.
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:52.140]   I think that those are key.
[02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:55.020]   And then in the end, as I said,
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:57.180]   so Chernobyl is physically impossible,
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:59.660]   actually, in a fusion system.
[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:00.580]   - From a physics perspective.
[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.780]   - From a physics perspective.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:03.860]   You can't run away like it did at Chernobyl,
[02:34:03.860 --> 02:34:07.140]   which was basically human error of letting
[02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:10.060]   the reactors run out of control, essentially.
[02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:13.060]   - Human error can still happen with fusion-based reactors.
[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:15.500]   - Yeah, but in that one, if human error occurs,
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:18.300]   then it just stops and this is done.
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:20.420]   And all of those things, this is the requirement
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:24.860]   of us as technologists and developers of this technology
[02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:28.340]   to not ignore that dimension, in fact, of the design.
[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.860]   And that's why me personally, I'm actually
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:34.220]   pouring myself more and more into that area
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:36.940]   because this is going to be, I actually really think
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:39.740]   it is an aspect of the economic viability of fusion
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:42.660]   because it clearly differentiates ourselves
[02:34:42.660 --> 02:34:45.420]   and also sets us up to be about what we want fusion to be,
[02:34:45.420 --> 02:34:48.220]   is that, again, on paper, fusion can supply
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:51.020]   all of our energy, like all of it.
[02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:53.140]   So this means I want it to be like
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:55.340]   really environmentally benign,
[02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:58.980]   but this takes engineering ingenuity, basically, to do that.
[02:34:58.980 --> 02:35:01.380]   - Let me ask you some wild out there questions.
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:02.300]   - Sure.
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:03.140]   - So for--
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.460]   - We've been talking too much, you know.
[02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:06.700]   (laughing)
[02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:11.060]   - Simple, practical things in everyday life.
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:14.340]   No, only revolutionizing the entire energy infrastructure
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:15.660]   of human civilization, yes.
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:20.660]   But, so cold fusion, this idea, this dream,
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:26.700]   this interesting physical goals seem to be impossible,
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:28.300]   but perhaps it's possible.
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:29.420]   Do you think it is possible?
[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:34.220]   Do you think down the line, somewhere in the far distance
[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:37.960]   it's possible to achieve fusion at low temperature?
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:41.900]   - It's very, very, very unlikely.
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:46.620]   And this comes from, so this would require
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:51.620]   a pretty fundamental shift in our understanding of physics,
[02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:53.140]   as we know it now.
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:55.180]   And we know a heck of a lot about
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:57.380]   how nuclear reactions occur.
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:00.660]   By the way, what's interesting is that there's,
[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:02.140]   they actually have a different name for it.
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:05.500]   They call it LEANER, like low energy nuclear reactions.
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:07.340]   But we do have low energy nuclear reactions.
[02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:09.980]   We know these, it's because these come from,
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:12.580]   particularly the weak interaction,
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:15.300]   the weak force, nuclear force.
[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:20.300]   And so it's, at this point, you know, as a scientist,
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:22.460]   you always keep yourself open, because,
[02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:24.140]   but you also demand proof, right?
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:24.980]   And that's the thing.
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:26.460]   - It almost requires a breakdown
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:28.140]   on the theoretical physics side.
[02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:29.860]   So something, some deeper understanding
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:32.460]   about quantum mechanics, so the quantum tunneling,
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:33.620]   some weird.
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:35.820]   - Yeah, and people have looked at that,
[02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:38.100]   but even like something like quantum tunneling
[02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:40.060]   has a limit as to what it can actually do.
[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:43.380]   So there are people who are genuine, you know,
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:45.220]   that really want to see it make,
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:47.460]   but, you know, it sort of goes to the extort,
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:51.780]   I mean, we know fusion happens at these high energies,
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:54.900]   like, we know this extremely accurately.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.380]   And I can show you a plot that shows that
[02:36:57.380 --> 02:36:58.780]   as you go to lower and lower energy,
[02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:00.740]   it basically becomes immeasurable.
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:03.300]   So if you're going down this other pathway,
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:07.100]   it means there's really a very different
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:09.540]   physical mechanism involved.
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:14.540]   So all I would say is that I actually poke in my head
[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:17.940]   once in a while to see what's going on in that area.
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:20.420]   And as scientists, we should always try
[02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:21.820]   to make ourselves open.
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:25.140]   And, but in this one, it's like,
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:28.700]   but show me something that I can measure
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:31.740]   and that is repeatable, and then it's gonna take
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.140]   more extraordinary effort.
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:35.940]   And to date, this has not met that threshold,
[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:36.780]   in my opinion.
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:40.660]   - So even more so than just mentioning,
[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:43.060]   or in that question, thinking about people
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:45.460]   that are claiming to have achieved cold fusion,
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.220]   I'm more thinking even about people
[02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:49.900]   who are studying black holes,
[02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:53.220]   and they're basically trying to understand
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:56.420]   the function of theoretical physicists.
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:38:00.340]   They're doing the long haul, trying to investigate,
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.660]   like, okay, what is happening at the singularity?
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:07.660]   What is this kind of holographic projections on a plate,
[02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:10.660]   these weird freaking things that are out there
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:12.940]   in the universe, and somehow, accidentally,
[02:38:12.940 --> 02:38:15.460]   they start to figure out something weird.
[02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:16.300]   - Weird, yeah.
[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:17.620]   - And then all of a sudden--
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:20.140]   - There's weirdness all over the place already, yeah.
[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:22.420]   - Somehow that weirdness will, I think,
[02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:24.860]   on a time scale probably of 100 years or so,
[02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:26.340]   that weirdness will open.
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:31.740]   It just seems like nuclear fusion and black holes
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:34.340]   and all of this are next-door neighbors
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:37.460]   a little bit too much for, like, you'll find something.
[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:38.300]   Interesting.
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:40.340]   - Well, let me tell you a story about this.
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.260]   It's a real story.
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:46.940]   So there were really, really clever scientists
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:50.620]   in the end of the late 1800s in the world.
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:52.980]   You talk about, like, James Clerk Maxwell,
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:54.900]   and you talk about Lord Kelvin,
[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:56.420]   and you talk about Lorentz, actually,
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:38:58.180]   who named after these other ones,
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:01.420]   and on and on and on, and like Faraday,
[02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:04.220]   and they discovered electromagnetism, holy cow,
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:07.140]   and it's like, they figure out all these things,
[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:12.140]   and yet there were these weird things going on
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:14.260]   that you couldn't quite figure out.
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:17.580]   It's like, what the heck is going on with this, right?
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:19.180]   By the way, we teach this all the time
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:21.300]   in physics classes, right?
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:22.540]   So what was going on?
[02:39:22.540 --> 02:39:27.540]   Well, there's just a few kind of things unchecked,
[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:29.700]   but basically, we're at the end of discovery
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:31.820]   'cause we figured out how everything works,
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:34.660]   'cause we've got basically Newtonian mechanics,
[02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:36.420]   and we've got Maxwell's equations,
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:39.500]   which describe basically how matter gets pushed around
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.060]   and how electromagnetism works.
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.940]   Holy cow, what a feat.
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:45.580]   But there were these few nagging things.
[02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:48.740]   Like, for instance, there's certain kinds of rocks
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:51.300]   that for some reason, like if you put a photographic plate
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:55.100]   around it, it gets burned, or it gets an image on it.
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:58.260]   Like, well, where's the electromagnetism in that?
[02:39:58.260 --> 02:40:00.860]   There's no electromagnetic properties of this rock.
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:03.420]   Oh yeah, and the other thing too is that
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:06.820]   if I take this wonderful classical derivation
[02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:11.460]   of something that is hot, about how it releases radiation,
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:15.380]   everything looks fantastic, perfect match.
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:20.060]   Oh, until I get to high frequencies of the light,
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:22.420]   and then it basically just, the whole thing falls apart.
[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:24.740]   In fact, it gives a physical explanation,
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:26.460]   which is total nonsense.
[02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:28.980]   It tells you that every object should basically
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:31.860]   be producing an infinite amount of heat.
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:35.940]   And by the way, here's the sun, and we can look at the sun,
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:37.900]   and we can figure out it's made out of hydrogen.
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:41.380]   And Lord Kelvin actually made a very famous calculation
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:44.300]   who was basically one of the founders of thermodynamics.
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:47.100]   So you look at the hydrogen, hydrogen has a certain
[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:49.460]   energy content, you know, the latent heat, basically,
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:51.580]   of hydrogen, we know the mass of the sun
[02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:54.740]   because we knew the size of it, and he conclusively proved
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:58.860]   that basically, the sun could only make net energy
[02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:01.180]   for about two or 3,000 years.
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:03.900]   So therefore, all this nonsense about deep,
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.860]   because clearly the sun can only last
[02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:08.460]   for two or 3,000 years, if you think about the,
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:10.420]   and this is basically the chemical energy content
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.620]   of hydrogen, and what comes along?
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:16.180]   And one decade, basically, one guy sitting
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:19.620]   in a postal office in Switzerland figures out
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:22.180]   that all of these, you know, Einstein, of course,
[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:24.740]   which was, like, figured out all of this,
[02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:28.100]   like, took these seemingly unconnected things,
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:29.660]   and it's like, boom, there it is.
[02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:31.300]   This is what, it wasn't just him, but it was,
[02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:32.860]   like, there's quantum physics, like,
[02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:34.940]   this explains this other disaster.
[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:37.740]   And then this other guy, my hero, Ernest Rutherford,
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:42.060]   experimentalist, did the most extraordinary experiment,
[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:45.740]   which was that, okay, they had these funny rocks.
[02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:46.900]   They emitted these particles.
[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:48.900]   In fact, they called them alpha particles,
[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:50.460]   alpha, just A in the alphabet, right?
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:52.860]   'Cause it was the first thing that they discovered.
[02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:53.820]   And what were they doing?
[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:56.940]   So they were taking these alpha particles,
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:41:58.820]   and by the way, I do this to all my students,
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:00.660]   'cause it's a demonstration of what you should be
[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:02.220]   as a good scientist.
[02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:03.540]   So he took these alpha things,
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:05.660]   and he was a classically trained physicist,
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:07.780]   knew everything about momentum scattering
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:10.180]   and so forth and like that, and he took this,
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:13.300]   and these alpha, which clearly were some kind of energy,
[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:14.860]   but they couldn't quite figure out what it was.
[02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:16.020]   So he said, "Let's try to figure that,
[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:18.700]   we'll actually use this to try to probe the nature of matter."
[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:22.060]   So he took this, took these alpha particles,
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:24.420]   and a very, very thin gold foil.
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:25.860]   And so what you wanted to see was that
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:27.540]   as they were going through,
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:29.740]   the way that they would scatter based on classical,
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:31.260]   in fact, the Coulomb collision,
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:32.900]   based on classical mechanics,
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:35.700]   this will tell me, reveal something
[02:42:35.700 --> 02:42:38.300]   about what the nature of the charge distribution is
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:40.140]   in matter, because they didn't know,
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:42.020]   like where the hell is this stuff coming from?
[02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:44.060]   Even though they'd solved electromagnetism,
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:46.820]   they didn't know like what made up charges.
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:48.540]   Okay, very interesting.
[02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:51.780]   Through it goes, and so what did you set up?
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:53.700]   So it turns out in these experiments,
[02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:57.940]   what you did was, because if these so-called alphas,
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:00.700]   which actually now we know is something else,
[02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:02.660]   as they go through, they would deflect,
[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:03.980]   how much they deflect tells you
[02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:06.140]   how strong an electric field they saw.
[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:08.260]   So you put detectors, 'cause if you put
[02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:10.460]   like a piece of glass in front of this,
[02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:12.380]   what will happen is that when the alpha particle hits,
[02:43:12.380 --> 02:43:14.020]   it literally gives a little, boop,
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:15.620]   a little point of light like this.
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:18.140]   It scintillates, a little blue flash.
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:20.180]   So he would train his students or postdocs
[02:43:20.180 --> 02:43:21.740]   or whatever the heck they were at the time,
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:22.780]   you have to train yourself,
[02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:24.300]   'cause you have to put yourself in the dark
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:27.020]   for like hours to get your eyes adjusted.
[02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:28.420]   And then they would start the experiment
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:30.820]   and they would sit there and literally count the things.
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:32.580]   And they could see this pattern developing,
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:35.460]   which was revealing about what was going on.
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:37.300]   But there was also another part of the experiment,
[02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:41.180]   which was that, it's like, here's the alphas,
[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:43.260]   here's the source, they're going this way.
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:44.980]   They could tell they were going in one direction only,
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:47.340]   basically, they're going in this direction.
[02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:48.500]   And you put all these over here,
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.740]   'cause you wanna see how they deflect and bend through it.
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:53.060]   But you put a control in the experiment,
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:58.060]   which you basically put glass plates back here,
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:00.940]   because obviously everything should just deflect,
[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:02.580]   but nothing should bounce back.
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:04.380]   So it's a control in the experiment.
[02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:06.780]   But what did they see?
[02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:10.100]   They saw things bouncing back.
[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:12.860]   Like, what the hell?
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:16.860]   Like, that fit no model of any idea, right?
[02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:21.580]   But Rutherford refused to ignore what was a clear,
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.180]   like, they validated it, and he sat down
[02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:25.780]   and based on classical physics,
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:28.620]   he made the most extraordinary discovery,
[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:30.540]   which was the nucleus,
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:33.460]   which is a very, very strange discovery.
[02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.580]   What do I mean by that?
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:35.900]   'Cause what he could figure out from this
[02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:39.620]   is that in order for these particles to bounce back
[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:42.180]   and hit this plate, they were hitting something
[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:45.140]   that must be heavier than them,
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:50.140]   and that basically something like 99.999% of the mass,
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:52.700]   of the matter that was in this gold foil
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:54.540]   was in something that contained
[02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:57.420]   about one trillionth of the volume of it.
[02:44:57.420 --> 02:45:00.740]   And that's called the nucleus.
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:03.860]   And until, and you talk about, so how revealing is this?
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:07.740]   It's like, this totally changes your idea of the universe
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:10.380]   because a nucleus is a very unintuitive,
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:11.780]   non-intuitive thing.
[02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:14.420]   It's like, why is all the mass in something
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:17.540]   that is like zero, like, basically it was the realization
[02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:19.340]   that matter is empty.
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:21.100]   It's all empty space.
[02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:22.180]   - Yeah, and that changes everything.
[02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:24.100]   - And it changes everything.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.300]   Until you had that, like, you had steam engines,
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:27.740]   by the way, you had telegraph wires,
[02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:28.980]   you had all those things.
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:31.620]   But that realization, like, opened up,
[02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:34.260]   those two realizations opened up everything,
[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.260]   like lasers, all these things about the modern world
[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:40.140]   of what we use, and that set it up.
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:42.700]   So all I would point out is that there's a story already
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:45.220]   that sometimes there's these nagging things
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.180]   at the edge of science that, you know,
[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:49.460]   we seem, we pat ourselves on the back
[02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:51.420]   and we think we got everything under control.
[02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:54.500]   Of course, by the way, that was the origin of also,
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:57.300]   that it, think about this, that was 1908.
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:00.860]   It took like another 20-some years
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:02.900]   before people put that together with,
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:05.520]   that's the process that's powering stars.
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:09.180]   It was the rearrangement of those nuclei, not atoms.
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:11.700]   That's why Calvin wasn't wrong,
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:14.340]   he just was working with the wrong assumptions, right?
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.540]   So fast forward to today, like, what would this mean?
[02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:19.060]   Well, there's a couple of things like this
[02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:20.580]   that sit out there in physics,
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:22.980]   and I'll point out one of them, which is very interesting.
[02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:25.140]   We don't know what the hell makes up 90%
[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:27.220]   of the mass in the universe.
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:29.580]   So, you know, the search for dark matter, right?
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:30.420]   What is it?
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:32.020]   We still haven't discovered it.
[02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:36.280]   90% of the mass of the universe is undetectable.
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:38.260]   Like, what?
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:39.700]   - And then, you know, and dark energy,
[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:42.700]   and again, black holes are the window into this.
[02:46:42.700 --> 02:46:44.420]   - Well, and black holes, I mean,
[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:47.340]   sometimes black holes are way better understood
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:49.140]   than those things as well, too.
[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:51.540]   So, all it tells us is that we shouldn't have hubris
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:54.420]   about the ideas that we understand everything.
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:56.980]   And when we, you know, who knows what the next
[02:46:56.980 --> 02:47:00.100]   major intellectual insight will be
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:02.260]   about how the universe functions.
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:05.340]   - And actually, I think Rutherford is the one
[02:47:05.340 --> 02:47:08.020]   who's attributed at least that quote,
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:10.380]   that physics is the only real science.
[02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:12.500]   Everything else is stamp collecting, right?
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:13.740]   So, there's--
[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:14.620]   - I'm sorry, he's my hero,
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:18.180]   but I'll slightly disagree with that, yes.
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:19.940]   - Well, no offense to stamp collecting.
[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:21.020]   It's very important, too.
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:22.020]   (laughing)
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:23.820]   But, you know, you have to have humility
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:26.340]   about the kind of disciplines that make progress
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:29.140]   at every stage in science.
[02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:29.980]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:32.180]   Physics did make a huge amount of progress
[02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:33.980]   in the 20th century, but it's possible
[02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:35.820]   that other disciplines start to step in.
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.460]   - Yeah, but Rutherford couldn't imagine
[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:39.060]   like mapping the human genome
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:40.860]   because he didn't even know about DNA.
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:42.340]   - Yeah, or computers, really.
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:43.180]   - Or computers.
[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:45.060]   - He really probably didn't think deeply about computation.
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:46.340]   - And who knows, it's like, is it,
[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:50.980]   here's a wild one, what if like the next great revelation
[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:53.580]   to humanity about the universe is not done
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:54.620]   by the human mind?
[02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:57.460]   - That seems increasingly more likely.
[02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:58.460]   - Likely, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:00.020]   And then you start to ask deep questions
[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:02.060]   about what is the purpose of science?
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:07.060]   For example, if AI system will design
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:10.860]   a nuclear fusion reactor better than humans do,
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:12.820]   but we don't quite understand how it works,
[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:15.780]   and the AI can't, we know that it works.
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:17.460]   We can test it very thoroughly,
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:21.140]   but we don't know exactly what the control mechanism is,
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:23.700]   maybe what the chemistry, the physics is.
[02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:25.780]   AI can't quite explain it, they just can't.
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:28.940]   It's impenetrable to our consciousness, basically,
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:30.220]   trying to hold it all together.
[02:48:30.220 --> 02:48:32.700]   - And then, okay, so now we're living in that world
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:34.860]   where many of the biggest discoveries
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:36.260]   are made by AI systems.
[02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:37.100]   - Yeah.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:40.380]   - As if we weren't going big.
[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:43.300]   - Yeah, I say, again, I'll point out,
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:45.820]   like when my godmother was born,
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:47.980]   like none of this was in front of us, right?
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:49.940]   It's like, we live in an amazing time.
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:53.060]   It's like, right, like my grandfather, you know,
[02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:56.100]   plowed fields with a horse.
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:58.300]   I get to work on designing fusion reactors.
[02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:59.700]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:00.940]   Pretty amazing time.
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:03.140]   - But still, there's humans, so we'll see.
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:05.180]   We'll see if that's around 100 years.
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.260]   Maybe it'll be cyborgs and robots.
[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:09.260]   - I think we're pretty resilient, actually.
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:10.100]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:14.540]   That's one lesson from life is it finds a way.
[02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:16.220]   Let me ask you a bigger question.
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:18.420]   As if those weren't big enough,
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:21.840]   let's look out maybe a few hundred years,
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:24.020]   maybe a few thousand years out.
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:26.140]   There's something called the Kardashev scale.
[02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:28.140]   It's a method of measuring civilization's level
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:30.840]   of technological advancement based on the amount
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:32.500]   of energy it's able to use.
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:35.420]   So type one civilization, and this might be,
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:38.620]   given all your work, is not no longer a scale
[02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:43.020]   that quite makes sense, but it very much focuses
[02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:46.100]   on the source of fusion, natural source of fusion,
[02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:48.100]   which is, for us, the sun.
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:51.700]   And type one civilizations are able to leverage
[02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:55.180]   sort of collect all the energy that hits Earth.
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:49:58.000]   And then type two civilizations are the ones
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.100]   that are able to leverage the entirety of the energy
[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:04.980]   that comes from the sun by maybe building something--
[02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:06.800]   - Like a Dyson sphere. - Like a Dyson sphere.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:09.580]   So when will we reach type one status?
[02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:12.420]   Is get to the level, which we're, I think,
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:15.660]   maybe a few orders of magnitude away from currently.
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:17.740]   And in general, do you think about this kind of stuff?
[02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:19.900]   Because where energy's so fundamental to,
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:24.240]   like, of life on Earth, but also the expansion
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:25.980]   of life into the universe.
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:30.340]   - Oh yeah, so one of the fun, on a weekend,
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:33.180]   when I sat down and figured out what would it mean
[02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:36.980]   for interstellar travel, like to have a DT fusion.
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:39.880]   In fact, one of the, I talked about my design class.
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:42.540]   One of my design classes was how you use,
[02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:47.180]   essentially, a special configuration of a fusion device
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:50.640]   for not only traveling to, but colonizing Mars.
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:53.980]   So, 'cause what would, you talk about energy use
[02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:55.980]   being at the heart of civilization.
[02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:57.780]   It's like, so what if you wanna go to Mars
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:59.740]   not to just visit it, but actually, like,
[02:50:59.740 --> 02:51:02.500]   leave people there and make something happen,
[02:51:02.500 --> 02:51:04.580]   needs massive amounts of energy.
[02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.700]   So what would that look like?
[02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:08.340]   And it actually transforms how you're thinking
[02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:09.900]   about doing that as well, too.
[02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:11.860]   Oh yeah, so we do all those kinds of fun.
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:14.820]   And actually, it was a fairly quasi-realistic, actually.
[02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:17.780]   - So do you think it'll be nuclear fusion
[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:20.420]   that powers the civilization on Mars?
[02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:22.280]   - Well, what we considered was something,
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:25.100]   so it turns out that there's thorium,
[02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:27.520]   which is a heavy element, so it's a so-called
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:31.280]   fertile element, that we know, we still know
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.640]   fairly little about the geology of Mars
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:37.640]   in the deep sense, and we know that there's a lot
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:39.160]   of this on the surface of Mars.
[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:41.740]   So one of the things we considered was what would happen,
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:45.060]   that it's basically a combination of a fusion device
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:48.900]   that actually makes fuel from the thorium.
[02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:53.160]   But the underlying energy one was fission itself
[02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:54.000]   as well, too.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.220]   So this is one of the examples of trying to be clever
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:51:58.060]   right around those things.
[02:51:58.060 --> 02:52:00.100]   Or what is it, you know, this also means
[02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:01.560]   it's like interstellar travel.
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:03.840]   It's like, oh yeah, that looks almost like impossible,
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:06.120]   basically, from an energy balance point of view,
[02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:09.740]   just 'cause the energy required that you have to transport
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:12.480]   to get there, almost the only things that would work
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:16.880]   are DT fusion and basically annihilation.
[02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:18.400]   It's like Star Trek, right?
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:19.240]   - That's what it is.
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:22.380]   - So your sense is that interstellar travel
[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.580]   will require fusion power.
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:27.380]   - Oh, it's almost even impossible with fusion power,
[02:52:27.380 --> 02:52:29.420]   actually, it's so hard.
[02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:33.480]   It's so hard, because you have to carry the fuel with you,
[02:52:33.480 --> 02:52:35.920]   and the rocket equation tells you about how much fuel
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:39.440]   you'll use to take, so what you end up with is like,
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:41.480]   how long does it take to go to these places?
[02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:44.900]   And it's like staggering, you know, periods of time.
[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:48.120]   - So I tend to believe that there's alien civilizations
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:50.040]   dispersed all throughout the universe.
[02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:52.840]   - Yeah, but we might be totally isolated from them.
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:55.280]   - So you think there's none in this galaxy?
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:58.840]   So like, and I guess, and the question I also have
[02:52:58.840 --> 02:53:01.960]   is what kind of, do you think they have nuclear fusion?
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.040]   'Cause like, is the physics all the same?
[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:06.120]   - Yeah, oh, the physics is all the same, yeah, right.
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:08.280]   So this is the, and this is the Fermi paradox,
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:10.880]   like where the hell is everybody in the universe?
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:15.160]   Well, there's some, you know, the scariest one of those
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:18.360]   is that, I would point out that there's been, you know,
[02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:21.520]   there's, you know, order of many tens of millions
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:25.160]   of species on the planet Earth, and only one ever got
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:28.080]   to the point of sophisticated tool use,
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:31.120]   that we could actually start essentially leveraging
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:35.480]   the power of what's in nature to our own will.
[02:53:35.480 --> 02:53:37.520]   Does this mean that basically this means,
[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:40.200]   so almost, look, there is almost certainly life
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.160]   or DNA equivalents or whatever would be somewhere,
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:45.000]   I mean, just 'cause you just need a soup
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.880]   and you need energy and you get organics
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:50.920]   and whatever the equivalent of amino acids are,
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:53.080]   but you know, most of the life on Earth has been that,
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:55.080]   those are still amazing, but it's still,
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:57.280]   like, it's not very interesting.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:59.680]   Are we actually the accident of history?
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:00.960]   This is a very interesting one.
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:03.040]   - Super, super rare accident.
[02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:05.400]   - Super rare, and then of course the other part
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:08.920]   is that also just the other scary part of it,
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:11.480]   which if you look at the Fermi paradox is,
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:15.160]   good, we got to this point, how long has it been
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:18.040]   in humans, so humans, Homo sapien has been around
[02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:21.760]   for whatever, 100,000 years, 200,000 years, something like that.
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:25.800]   Our ability in that timeline to actually make an imprint
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:28.600]   on the universe by emitting radio waves
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:32.240]   or by modifying nature in a significant way
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:35.840]   has only been for about 100 of those 100,000 years.
[02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:40.680]   And are we, it's a good question, so is it by definition,
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:43.880]   by the fact that when you are able to reach that level
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:47.000]   of being able to manipulate nature, for example,
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:51.120]   discover, you know, discover like fission
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.840]   or burning fossil fuels and all this,
[02:54:55.840 --> 02:54:57.800]   is that what it says, oh, you're doomed,
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:01.400]   because by definition, any species that gets to that point
[02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:03.760]   that can modify their environment like that,
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:06.880]   they'll actually push themselves past,
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:08.520]   that's one of the most depressing scenarios
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:09.360]   that I can imagine.
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:10.200]   - Yeah, so the--
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.640]   - So basically, we will never line up in time,
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:15.760]   'cause you get this little teeny window in time
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:19.120]   where civilization might occur and you can never see it,
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:22.320]   because you never, these sort of like scatter,
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:25.400]   like fireflies around the galaxy and you never, yeah.
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:26.960]   - Goes up, goes up, goes up, goes up,
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:28.820]   and then explodes, destroys itself
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:30.320]   because of the exponential--
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:31.640]   - And when we say destroy ourselves,
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:34.080]   all we'd have to do is that we basically go,
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:38.160]   if humans are all left and we're still living on the planet,
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:43.160]   but all we have to do is go to the technology of like 1800
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:45.600]   and we're invisible in the universe again.
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:49.200]   So it was, when I listened to the,
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.040]   I thought I wanted to talk about this as well too,
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:53.320]   because it comes from, well, it comes from a science point
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:55.920]   view actually of what it means, but also to me,
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:58.360]   it's like another compelling driver of telling us
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:00.780]   it's like why we should try really hard
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:02.540]   not to screw this up.
[02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:05.340]   Like we're in this unique place of our ability
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:08.600]   to discover and to make it, and I just don't want
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:11.080]   to give up about thinking that we can get through.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:13.280]   - Yeah, I tend to see that there's some kind
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:15.640]   of game theoretic force, like with mutually assured
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.360]   destruction, that ultimately in each human being
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:24.360]   there's a desire to survive and a willingness to cooperate,
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:27.800]   to have compassion for each other in order to survive,
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:32.000]   and I think that, I mean, maybe not in humans,
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.000]   but I can imagine a nearly infinite number of species
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:40.000]   in which that overpowers any technological advancement
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.800]   that can destroy or rewind the species.
[02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:48.320]   So I think if humans fail, I hope they don't.
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:50.040]   I see a lot of evidence for them not,
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:52.280]   but it seems like somebody will survive.
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:54.760]   And there you start to ask questions about why,
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:56.320]   why we haven't met yet.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:58.200]   Maybe it's just space is large.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:02.240]   - Oh, space is, it's, I think in logarithms,
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:05.240]   and I can't even fathom space.
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:07.520]   This is extraordinary, right?
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:08.360]   - Yeah.
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:10.000]   - It's extraordinarily large.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.420]   - I mean, there's so many places on Earth.
[02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:14.000]   I just recently visited Paris for the first time,
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.560]   and there's so many other places I haven't visited yet.
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:16.640]   - There's so many other places.
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:19.120]   Well, I like to, you know, it's interesting
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:22.140]   that we have this fascination with alien life.
[02:57:22.140 --> 02:57:25.960]   We have what is essentially alien life on Earth already.
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:28.800]   Like, you think about the organisms that develop
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:31.080]   around deep sea, like thermal vents.
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:34.680]   One of my favorite books of all time from Stephen Jay Gould,
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:37.800]   if you've never read that book, it kind of blows your mind.
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:40.360]   It's about the Cambrian explosion of life,
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:42.500]   and it's like, oh, you look at these things,
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:46.320]   and it's like, the chance of us existing as a species,
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:50.280]   like the genetic diversity was larger back then.
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:52.520]   You know, this is about 500 million years ago
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:53.640]   or something like that.
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:57.480]   It is a mind-altering trip of thinking about our place
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:58.800]   in the universe, I have to say.
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:00.520]   - Plus the mind itself.
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:01.360]   - Yeah.
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:06.280]   - Is a kind of alien, almost a mystery to ourselves.
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:07.360]   We still don't understand it.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.600]   The very mechanism that helps us explore the world
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:11.840]   is still a mystery.
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:12.680]   - Yeah.
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:16.280]   - So that, like understanding that will also unlock,
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:21.280]   quite possibly unlock our ability to understand the world,
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:23.440]   and maybe build machines that help us understand the world,
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:24.440]   build tools that--
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:25.800]   - Yeah, I mean, it already has.
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:27.840]   I mean, our ability to understand the world
[02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:30.740]   is ridiculous almost, actually.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.840]   (laughing)
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:34.440]   - And post the bottom on TikTok.
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:35.640]   - It's almost unbelievable,
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:38.080]   like where we've gotten all this to, yeah.
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:42.520]   - So what advice would you give to young folks,
[02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:44.960]   or folks of all ages who are lost in this world,
[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:46.960]   looking for a way, looking for a career
[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:49.680]   they can be proud of, or looking to have a life
[02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:50.520]   they can be proud of?
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:53.440]   - Yeah, oh, the first thing I would say is don't give up.
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:55.980]   I get to see multiple sides of this,
[02:58:55.980 --> 02:59:00.980]   and there seems to be a level of despair
[02:59:00.980 --> 02:59:03.180]   in a young generation.
[02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:07.280]   It's like, no, it's almost like the Monty Python skit,
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:08.840]   like, I'm not dead yet, right?
[02:59:08.840 --> 02:59:11.360]   I mean, like, we're not there.
[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:13.560]   We're in a place that, you know,
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:18.760]   don't say the world's gonna end in 300 days or something.
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.000]   It's not, okay?
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:24.080]   And what we mean by this is that we have a robust society
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:26.380]   that's figured out how to do amazing things,
[02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:28.720]   and we're gonna keep doing amazing things.
[02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:32.760]   But that shouldn't be complacency about what our future is,
[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:35.720]   and the future for their children as well, too.
[02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:39.440]   And in the end, I mean, it's a staggering legacy
[02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:41.460]   to think of what we've built up,
[02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:43.660]   primarily by basically using carbon fuels.
[02:59:43.660 --> 02:59:45.340]   Like, people almost tend to think of this
[02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:47.120]   as an evil thing that we've done.
[02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:49.620]   I think it's an amazing thing that we've done,
[02:59:49.620 --> 02:59:51.700]   but we owe it to ourselves,
[02:59:51.700 --> 02:59:54.580]   and to this thing that we've built.
[02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:55.660]   I mean, we've talked about the end of the world,
[02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:56.820]   it's just nonsense.
[02:59:56.820 --> 03:00:00.380]   What it is is it's the end of this kind of lifestyle,
[03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:02.940]   and civilization at this scale,
[03:00:02.940 --> 03:00:05.220]   and the ability to execute on these kinds of things
[03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:06.940]   that we are talking about today.
[03:00:06.940 --> 03:00:09.540]   Like, we are extraordinarily privileged.
[03:00:09.540 --> 03:00:12.140]   We are in a place where it's just,
[03:00:12.140 --> 03:00:15.400]   it's almost unfathomable compared to most of the misery
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:17.340]   that humans have lived in for our history.
[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:19.740]   So don't give up about this, okay?
[03:00:19.740 --> 03:00:21.900]   But also roll up your sleeves,
[03:00:21.900 --> 03:00:23.780]   and let's get going at solving,
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:25.820]   at getting real solutions to the problems
[03:00:25.820 --> 03:00:28.260]   that are in front of us, which are significant.
[03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:30.140]   You know, it's, I would argue,
[03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:33.380]   most of them are linked to what we use in energy,
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:34.500]   but it's not just that.
[03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:38.300]   It's around all the aspects of, like, what does it mean,
[03:00:38.300 --> 03:00:41.100]   like, what does it mean to have a distributed energy source
[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:43.580]   that lifts billions of people out of poverty,
[03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:45.220]   you know, particularly outside of, like,
[03:00:45.220 --> 03:00:46.980]   the Western nations, right?
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:50.140]   That seems to me a pretty compelling, you know,
[03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:53.820]   moral goal for all of us,
[03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:57.500]   but particularly for this upcoming generation.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:00.020]   And then the other part is that we've got
[03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:02.320]   possible solutions in front of us.
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:07.320]   Apply your talents in a way that you're passionate about
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:09.800]   and is gonna make a difference.
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:13.460]   - And that's only possible with optimism,
[03:01:13.460 --> 03:01:14.860]   hope, and hard work.
[03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:15.820]   - Yeah.
[03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:17.920]   - What, easy question.
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:21.420]   Certainly easier than nuclear fusion.
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:22.560]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:23.820]   Why are we here?
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:25.020]   - 42.
[03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:25.860]   - Is it 42?
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:26.680]   - No, no.
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:30.300]   - We already discussed about the beauty of physics,
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:32.260]   that there's almost a desire to ask a why question
[03:01:32.260 --> 03:01:34.340]   about why the parameters have these values.
[03:01:34.340 --> 03:01:35.540]   - Yeah.
[03:01:35.540 --> 03:01:37.060]   It's very tempting, yeah.
[03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:41.580]   It's an interesting hole to go down as a scientist,
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:45.700]   'cause we're a part of what people have a hard time,
[03:01:45.700 --> 03:01:47.540]   people who aren't scientists have a hard time
[03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:49.940]   understanding what scientists do to themselves.
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:53.540]   And a great scientist does a very non-intuitive
[03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:54.980]   or non-human thing.
[03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:57.580]   What we do is we train ourselves to doubt ourselves,
[03:01:57.580 --> 03:01:59.860]   like how, like that's a great scientist.
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:01.660]   We doubt everything we see,
[03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:03.380]   we doubt everything that we think,
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:08.380]   because we basically try to turn off the belief valve,
[03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:12.100]   right, that humans just naturally have.
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:14.980]   So when it comes to these things,
[03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:17.260]   like I can make my own comments to this,
[03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:19.780]   it's like personally, you see these things
[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.820]   about the ratios of life.
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:21.940]   And I made a comment to it, I said,
[03:02:21.940 --> 03:02:24.580]   well, you know, a wrap my, some part of my brain
[03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:27.140]   that just goes, yeah, well, yeah,
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:29.340]   'cause we're the only interesting multiverse,
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:31.900]   because by definition, it has to look like this.
[03:02:31.900 --> 03:02:35.420]   But I have to say, there's other times,
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:37.820]   I can say in the history of the whole,
[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:40.020]   of what has happened over the last 10 years,
[03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:42.300]   there have been some pretty weird coincidences,
[03:02:42.300 --> 03:02:45.780]   like coincidences that like you look at it and just go,
[03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:48.780]   is that really, was that really a coincidence?
[03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:54.260]   Is something like pushing us towards these things?
[03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:56.180]   And it's a natural, it's a human instinct,
[03:02:56.180 --> 03:02:58.660]   because since the beginnings of humanity,
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:03.660]   we've always assigned human motivation and needs
[03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:08.740]   to these somewhat empirical observations.
[03:03:08.740 --> 03:03:10.580]   - And in some sense, the stories,
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:14.700]   before we understand the real explanations,
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:19.700]   the stories, the myths, serve as a good approximation
[03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:21.700]   for the thing that we're yet to understand.
[03:03:21.700 --> 03:03:23.420]   - Absolutely. - And in that sense,
[03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:26.140]   you said the antithesis to sort of scientific doubt
[03:03:26.140 --> 03:03:29.600]   is having a faith in these stories,
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:33.220]   they're almost silly when looked at
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:34.780]   from a scientific perspective,
[03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:36.400]   but just even the feelings of,
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:39.000]   it seems that love is a fundamental fabric
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:42.340]   of human condition, and what the hell is that?
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:43.640]   (laughing)
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:45.000]   - Well, actually-- - Why are we so connected
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.720]   to each other? - Again, as a physicist,
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:50.600]   I go, it's, you know, this is a repeatable thing
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:52.440]   that's due to a set of synapses
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:54.800]   that fire in a particular pattern and all this.
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:56.400]   You know, that's kind of like, okay, man,
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:59.040]   what a drag that is, right, to think of it this way.
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:01.640]   - And you can have an evolutionary biology explanation,
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:02.880]   but there's still a magic to it.
[03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:05.480]   - I mean, I see scientists, some of my colleagues,
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:07.000]   you know, do this as well, too.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.800]   Like, what is spirituality compared to science?
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:15.040]   And so, my own feeling in this is that,
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:18.600]   you know, as a scientist, 'cause I've had the pleasure
[03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:22.680]   of being able to both understand what my predecessors did,
[03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:24.560]   but I also had the privilege of being able
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:26.880]   to discover things, right, as a scientist.
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:29.960]   And I see that, and you just,
[03:04:29.960 --> 03:04:32.520]   in just the range of our conversations,
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:35.800]   like, that is my, in a weird way,
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:39.320]   it's the awe that comes from looking at that.
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:43.600]   That is, if you're not in awe of the universe and nature,
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:45.000]   you haven't been paying attention.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.960]   I mean, my own personal feeling is that I feel,
[03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:53.440]   if I go snorkeling on a coral reef,
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:56.920]   I feel more awe than I could ever feel, like in a church.
[03:04:56.920 --> 03:04:59.960]   - You kind of notice some kind of magic there.
[03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:02.640]   There's something about the way the whole darn thing
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:06.680]   holds together that just sort of escapes your imagination.
[03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:09.760]   And that's, to me, this thing of,
[03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:10.880]   and then we have different words,
[03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:13.400]   we call them holistic or spiritual,
[03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:15.120]   the way that it all hangs together.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:16.560]   In fact, one of the interesting,
[03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:18.280]   you asked about what I think about,
[03:05:18.280 --> 03:05:20.120]   one of the craziest things that I think,
[03:05:20.120 --> 03:05:23.360]   that how does it hold together, is like our society.
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.400]   Like, how does, what?
[03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:26.240]   - Yeah.
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:28.240]   - Like, how, 'cause there's no way,
[03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:30.000]   like, just think of the United States.
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:35.000]   There's 330 million people kind of working like this engine
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:38.600]   about going towards making all these things happen,
[03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:41.200]   but there's like no one in charge of this, really.
[03:05:41.200 --> 03:05:42.040]   - Not really, yeah.
[03:05:42.040 --> 03:05:44.040]   - How the heck does this happen?
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:47.040]   It's kind of like, it's, so these things,
[03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:48.760]   these are the kinds of things mathematically
[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:51.800]   and organization-wise that I think of,
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:54.520]   just because they're sort of, they're awe-inspiring.
[03:05:54.520 --> 03:05:57.760]   - And there's different ideas that would come up together,
[03:05:57.760 --> 03:06:01.080]   and we share them, and then there's teams of people
[03:06:01.080 --> 03:06:03.160]   that share different ideas, and those ideas compete.
[03:06:03.160 --> 03:06:05.400]   Like, the ideas themselves are these kinds
[03:06:05.400 --> 03:06:07.360]   of different organisms, and ultimately,
[03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:10.160]   somehow we build bridges and nuclear reactors.
[03:06:10.160 --> 03:06:11.280]   - And do those things.
[03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:13.040]   Well, I have to give a shout-out to my daughter,
[03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:14.800]   by the way, who's interesting.
[03:06:14.800 --> 03:06:17.920]   She's an applied math major, and she's amazing at math,
[03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:19.200]   and over the break, she was showing me
[03:06:19.200 --> 03:06:21.600]   she was doing research, and it's basically about
[03:06:21.600 --> 03:06:26.600]   how ideas and ethos are transmitted within a society.
[03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:29.360]   So she's building an applied math model
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:32.080]   that is explaining, like, she was showing me
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:34.760]   in this simulation, she goes, "Oh, look at this,"
[03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:37.960]   and I said, "Oh, oh, that's like how political parties
[03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:39.360]   "evolve," right?
[03:06:39.360 --> 03:06:41.200]   And even though it was a rather, quote-unquote,
[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:44.160]   simple mathematical model, it wasn't really,
[03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:45.820]   it's like, oh, wow.
[03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:49.840]   - Well, maybe she has a chance to derive mathematically
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:52.520]   the answer to what's the meaning of life.
[03:06:52.520 --> 03:06:53.360]   - There we go.
[03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:54.400]   - And maybe it is indeed 42.
[03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:59.400]   - Well, Dennis, thank you so much for just doing,
[03:06:59.400 --> 03:07:04.200]   creating tools, creating systems, exploring this idea
[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:07.120]   that's one of the most amazing magical ideas
[03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:10.720]   in all of human endeavor, which is nuclear fusion.
[03:07:10.720 --> 03:07:12.880]   I mean, that's so interesting.
[03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:16.240]   - You know, it's almost like my, one of my lifelong goals
[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:18.640]   is to make it, it's not magic.
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:20.440]   It's like, it's boring as all heck.
[03:07:20.440 --> 03:07:21.800]   (laughing)
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:24.360]   And this means we're using it everywhere, right?
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:25.440]   - Yeah.
[03:07:25.440 --> 03:07:27.960]   And the magic is then built on top of it.
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:29.960]   Well, thank you for everything you do.
[03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:30.800]   Thank you for talking to me.
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:31.640]   It's a huge honor.
[03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:33.960]   This was a fascinating and amazing conversation.
[03:07:33.960 --> 03:07:35.480]   - Thank you.
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:36.960]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:38.200]   with Dennis White.

[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:41.960]   in the description.
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:44.080]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:45.400]   from Albert Einstein.
[03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:48.720]   There are two ways to live your life.
[03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:51.520]   One is as though nothing is a miracle.
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:54.960]   The other is though everything's a miracle.
[03:07:54.960 --> 03:07:56.080]   Thank you for listening.
[03:07:56.080 --> 03:07:58.000]   I hope to see you next time.
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.600]   (upbeat music)
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:03.200]   (upbeat music)
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:13.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
