[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.340]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.500]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.180]   I'm here with the brightest man in America today, Duncan.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.620]   Nice to see you.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.340]   - I admit, it's not the best color combo.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.500]   I should have probably looked in the mirror
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.980]   before I left the house.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980]   - I'm not one to talk about colors.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.820]   I don't mind having some bright colors, I think it looks good.
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.800]   - I just got excited, you know,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.540]   we were at the NASCAR museum for the live recording,
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420]   so I had to wear a NASCAR hat today.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.280]   - You do look like you're at a NASCAR event.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580]   Today's show is sponsored by Rocket Money.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.720]   I've been using Rocket Money lately.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.620]   I am a set it and forget it kind of guy
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.220]   when it comes to finances and other parts of my life.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.580]   Like last night, I got home pretty late, I was on a trip,
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.340]   and I got an alert on my phone saying,
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.460]   "Take the trash out."
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.300]   I would have forgotten,
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.440]   'cause they come really early in the morning
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.660]   to pick up the trash, and so I like alerts.
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.060]   And the cool thing about Rocket Money
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700]   that I've been using it is
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.980]   it gives you these alerts all the time.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.420]   "Hey, there's an unknown transaction here.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.480]   "It's a pretty big one.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.260]   "Make sure this is legit."
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.580]   And I get probably one or two of those a week,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.420]   and most of them are fine,
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.980]   but some of them could be like an erroneous transaction.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.820]   It's kind of great,
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.900]   and it also talks about upcoming recurring payments.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.060]   So I still, I like to feel like the '90s sometimes,
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.040]   like the pre- and post-internet era.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.740]   I still get GQ Magazine.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160]   It said, "Hey, your GQ Magazine is coming up."
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   I like the physical magazine,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.400]   and it said, "Your GQ Magazine is coming up,"
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.240]   and the price is like $33 a year,
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.560]   and I'm like, "I can get it for like six."
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.940]   So I go in there, and Rocket Money helps me.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.780]   It's great.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.400]   They try to lower your bills.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.000]   RocketMoney.com/ATC to learn more.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700]   It's a really great way to manage your money,
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.360]   and I think they're shutting down
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.440]   these other personal finance sites,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.040]   so Rocket Money's like the last one standing.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.880]   I like it.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.560]   - I guess everyone else is giving up.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   They can't do it as well.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.560]   - All right, let's do it.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.740]   - All right.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.080]   - Wait, so who's the NASCAR driver in your head?
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.400]   - So this is actually a Dale Jr. hat,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.480]   so it was like a throwback to one of his dad's cars,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.800]   a Dale Earnhardt car that had the SunDrop.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360]   SunDrop, which apparently is a North Carolina soda.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   I'd never even thought about that, but yeah.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.680]   - In Michigan, we call it a pop.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   In North Carolina, you call it a soda.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.920]   - Maybe.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   I think everyone calls it everything.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.520]   A lot of people call it Coke,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.000]   like any kind of soft drink.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.040]   - That's a Southern thing,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.840]   where you call any sort of soft drink a Coke.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.360]   - Yeah, even though Pepsi's better, but you know.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   - All right.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.020]   - Just kidding.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.860]   - Agree to disagree.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.200]   - Okay, okay.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.320]   First up today, we have,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   "Can you please explain why financial media personnel
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.800]   "keep saying the 60/40 is dead,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.880]   "but they are not saying target date funds are dead?"
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.520]   - This is a great, this is actually a really good question,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   because I've been kind of thinking about this lately.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.240]   It seems like the financial media
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.040]   loves to pour dirt on the 60/40,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.440]   and a lot of it is recency bias.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.600]   Last year was one of the worst years ever
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.760]   for a 60/40 portfolio.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   John, do a chart on here.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.440]   These are the 10 worst calendar year returns
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.400]   for a portfolio compromising the S&P 500,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.640]   60% of which, and 40% in 10-year treasuries.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.800]   60/40, rebalance every year.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   Going back to 1928, by my calculations,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.760]   2022 was the third worst year ever.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.240]   And the worst year ever was in the Great Depression in 1931.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   Second worst year ever was also in the '30s in 1937.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.480]   So that's a pretty bad year.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.600]   This was even worse than the worst downturn in the 1970s.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.040]   Maybe it would be worse then on a real basis,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.280]   but that's pretty bad.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.440]   The third worst year in 95 years.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.360]   But, I don't know, bad things happen
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   in every asset class and strategy.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.480]   They're called risk assets for a reason, right?
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.040]   I don't think one year is enough
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.200]   to throw a strategy out the window
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.960]   unless it completely blows up.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.040]   So, I think a lot of people like to say,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   well, the 60/40 is broken 'cause bonds got killed,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.200]   and it's not gonna work going forward,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   and correlations are higher.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   So ditch the simple and go with the complex.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.720]   I do think that's part of it,
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440]   is that the financial media complexity sells
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.040]   way better than simplicity, right?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.400]   You get way more eyeballs by selling something
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.800]   that's complicated and saying the simple thing
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.160]   just doesn't work because, put this other one up, John.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.280]   So the media's been planning a funeral
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   for the 60/40 for years.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   I wrote this piece in like 2017
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.600]   and found all these stories going back to 2012
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.240]   about why balance portfolios aren't gonna work anymore,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   60/40 is dead, it's dead and buried.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.200]   I even wrote a eulogy blog post for 60/40 back in 2019.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.160]   So, it's something that I think,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.120]   it's just a stand-in for a simple portfolio
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.960]   'cause there's just not much going on with it.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.400]   It's very simple.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   It's also important to note that,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.600]   I don't know if I've ever met anyone
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.760]   who actually has all of their money,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.440]   60% stock and 40% bonds, and that's it, right?
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.280]   Most people probably--
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.240]   - That would become active trying to maintain that, right?
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.920]   Because it changes so much.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.760]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.080]   But I mean, most people have some cash.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600]   They probably own some real estate.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.760]   They may have some REITs or foreign stocks
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800]   or foreign bonds or high yield or corporate bonds
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   or munis or value stocks or momentum stocks
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.200]   or quality or dividends, whatever it is.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.280]   There's all these other strategies.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.040]   And I think that's, in that sense,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.920]   most regular portfolios are probably more
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.320]   like target date funds than anything else.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.480]   And the other thing is, the difference is,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.000]   target date funds actually change allocations over time.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.680]   And so, I don't think they're as easy as a target
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.280]   'cause there is some activity going on there.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.040]   So, I think that that's the thing.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.880]   Activity and complexity sell better for financial media.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.840]   So, it makes sense that the 60/40
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.720]   is like the straw man or whatever.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.160]   I also think we live in a world where pundits
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.320]   become famous for predicting a top or a bottom.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   Like, this is the bear market.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   This is the bull market.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.340]   This is the end.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.180]   This is the beginning.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.720]   It's gotta be a point in time, right?
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.960]   This thing is just getting over with.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.800]   It's gonna fall off a cliff.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.920]   This thing is just getting started.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.720]   You're never gonna hear a headline about like,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920]   a boring diversified portfolio does well most of the time,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.740]   but not all the time.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.000]   That's not a very good headline, right?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.440]   There's also this contingent of financial pundits
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.000]   who like to say that, listen,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.760]   the only reason a 60/40 portfolio has worked so well
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.880]   over the past 40 plus years is because
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.080]   inflation has been falling
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.120]   and interest rates have been falling.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.920]   And that certainly was a tailwind,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.560]   especially the bond side of the portfolio,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.040]   'cause you had such high starting yields.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   But I looked at the period of 41 years from 1981 to 2021,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.800]   which is basically the top in rates.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.180]   Rates were falling most of that time
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.120]   and inflation was falling.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.840]   We were in a disinflationary environment.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.480]   And then I looked at the previous 41 years
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   from 1940 to through the end of 1980.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.080]   So John filled this up for me.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.800]   Returns were certainly better
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.720]   in the period from 1981 to 2021.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.580]   10.5% per year for a 60/40 annually rebalanced,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.280]   which is just an amazing return.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.800]   It's basically like the historical long run
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.160]   for the stock market.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.880]   But 1940 to 1980 had almost 8% annual returns.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.360]   So it was worse, but it wasn't that much worse.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.560]   And the biggest part was 10-year treasuries
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.240]   did almost 8% annually in the '81 to 2021 period.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.320]   Bonds were only up 2.5% per year from 1940 to 1980.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.760]   So if we look at the previous 95 years,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.240]   Demoderan has this website I use all the time from NYU.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.580]   From 1928 to 2022, a 60/40 portfolio was up 8.1% per year.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.300]   So it's not like that environment pre-1980
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.140]   was that much worse.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.780]   It was right around average, right?
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.060]   And the crazy thing about the 2022 period
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.340]   being the third worst year ever for 60/40,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.780]   the 10 years ending in 2022.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.860]   So add the nine years before 2022
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.820]   and average returns for a 60/40 were almost 8% per year.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.740]   So even with one of the worst years ever,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.160]   it still was pretty good.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.220]   And I can't promise what those returns
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.300]   are gonna be going forward
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.780]   'cause I don't know what stock returns are gonna be.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.700]   I don't know what interest rates are gonna be,
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.820]   but we're in a pretty good place now
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.940]   'cause you can get 4% to 6% in your bonds depending.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.400]   Like we're gonna talk about that in a little bit here,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.060]   but if bonds are yielding 5%
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.360]   and the historical equity risk premium
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.940]   is 3% to 4% above bonds or cash,
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.400]   we're talking, I don't know, 8% to 9% for stocks
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.780]   is not out of the realm of possibility.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.420]   So that's 7% for a 60/40 portfolio almost, 6%.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.480]   - Junk bonds, you can get even closer to like 9%, right?
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.320]   - Yeah, I mean, those are more equity-like,
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.600]   but so if you want it,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.820]   that'd be more of an equity-like portfolio.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.080]   I mean, you call it 60/40, but it's really 100.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.920]   - Yeah.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.860]   - So I just, I can't guarantee
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.700]   what these returns are gonna be,
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.540]   but you're in a better place now
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.960]   than you were before 2022 after you ripped the Band-Aid off.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.080]   And so I just say, stop listening to the people
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.640]   who say 60/40 is dead.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.560]   It's lazy analysis.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.740]   Saying 60/40 is dead is like saying diversification is dead.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.640]   And if that happens,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.100]   then maybe just haul me out to and bury me
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.920]   because if diversification dies,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.520]   I've got nothing to live for.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.740]   - Oh my God, this got real.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.580]   (laughs)
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.400]   - I'm just kidding.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.720]   I just, saying it, it's just lazy analysis
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.160]   and it has no basis in reality.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   60/40 is alive and well, and it always will be.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.720]   - Yeah, it makes me want to buy 60/40 more, you know?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.320]   It makes me more bullish to hear everyone saying that's dead.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   - Yeah, I don't get it.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.040]   I think it's a sort of a stand-in for simplicity
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.600]   and it's an easy, it's like easy whipping boy.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.560]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.240]   All right, that question was from Jacob, by the way.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.340]   So up next, we have a question from Billy.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.520]   "I know the running joke is that Ben
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.020]   "is Mr. Target Date Guy,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.140]   "but in a recent episode,
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.460]   "he mentioned that he rebalanced
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.520]   "to pick up more small cap value.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.860]   "Is he a Fama French guy instead?
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.420]   "I was wondering what Ben's portfolio for investing,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.600]   "not trading, looks like from an asset class perspective.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.480]   "Secondarily, how often does he rebalance it?"
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.520]   A little hurt they didn't ask about my portfolio, but.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.840]   (laughs)
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.680]   - We already know what it is, Oatly.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.880]   - Oatly reported earnings today.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.380]   - 60% Oatly and 40% some EV stock.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.360]   So two questions in a row about target date funds.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   So I guess I am, my reputation does precede me.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   My first ever investment was in a target date fund.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.120]   So that's where I get this reputation from.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.640]   My dad helped me open up an IRA when I got my first job.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.600]   My first job didn't have a 401k.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.960]   And so I had to open up my own IRA
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.320]   and I put money in like a T-Roll price target date fund.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.760]   I think the only target date funds I own now
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.160]   are my kid's college funds for 529 plans.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.200]   So based on the stage of life where I'm at now,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.480]   I'm a barbell investor.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.240]   That means on one side, on the safe side,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.520]   and my barbell is safety and risk, right?
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440]   So on the safe side, I have a slug of cash
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.760]   for vacations and emergencies
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.620]   and stuff that comes up with kids
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.480]   and other intermediate term goals that we may have.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.600]   And the other side of that barbell is risk
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.320]   and that's stocks, basically.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.260]   So I have a pretty high talents for risk.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.080]   All my long-term capital is invested in the stock market.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   I'm not gonna touch most of it for decades.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.800]   So that's 100% in the stock market.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.620]   Now I am a bogel head at heart, right?
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.240]   My biggest holding in any of my accounts
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.360]   is a total US stock market index fund, right?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.320]   Very cheap, market cap weighted.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.520]   But I also like to diversify into other areas.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.480]   So I do have a little fond of French.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.800]   I have the small cap value piece.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.240]   I have some momentum funds.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.280]   I have some higher quality funds
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.600]   and I have international stocks.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.640]   I diversify there too by some value stocks
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.560]   and small caps there.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.720]   So I do have some diversification.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.940]   The index funds are the biggest, like the building block.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.200]   And then I have these satellites or diversification there.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.160]   And I don't hold these kind of factor funds
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.280]   for outperformance or anything like that,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.560]   which is kind of laughable to anyone
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.920]   who's looked at them in the last 10 or 12 years
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   'cause none of those other strategies have outperformed.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.600]   But I just don't think market weighted index funds
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.640]   are gonna outperform every single cycle.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.680]   And so I have these other funds
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.120]   so I can rebalance into them and diversify
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.480]   and have these other parts of the portfolio
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.240]   that'll hopefully hold up well
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.880]   if and when the index funds don't do well.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   I did mention that I, on Recent Annual Spirits,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.120]   that I over-rebalanced recently.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.840]   I have three main rebalancing strategies.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.200]   One, I said in the opener, I'm a set it and forget it guy.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.240]   So when I 401k, that kind of account,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.720]   I automatically rebalance.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.860]   I have it set to do once a year on a certain date.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.700]   I don't know when the date is.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.920]   I set it and I forget about it.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.360]   The other one is if asset weights get too far out of whack.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.200]   And that's usually in a--
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.040]   - Wait, what's the best day of the year to rebalance?
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.880]   I'm just--
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.400]   - I'm sure someone has that data.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.680]   I've seen people look at it.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.720]   It's like it's in April, October for tax reasons.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.560]   I don't know.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.080]   I don't think that far into it.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.720]   The other one is if asset class weights
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.960]   get too far from the target.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.200]   If something really outperforms
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.460]   and something really underperforms,
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.300]   maybe I'll get in there.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.360]   That'd happen in maybe like a bear market
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.040]   or like a rip-roaring bull market.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.240]   And then another way is last week
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.000]   I made a pretty sizable contribution to my SEP IRA.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.120]   Bill Sweet would be happy with me about that.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.160]   It's gonna help my taxes.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.680]   And I over-rebalanced into some areas
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.800]   that had underperformed.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   So I used contributions to rebalance as well.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.140]   So I don't know.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.280]   I don't know if that having these other areas
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.200]   of the market will help my returns over time.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.240]   I do like the idea of making contributions to those areas.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.860]   So I'm making more contributions to the places
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.720]   that have not run as high in recent years.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.560]   But I don't see the point of having an asset allocation
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.760]   if you're not going to rebalance back
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.200]   to target weights eventually.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.840]   I think that's the whole point.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.000]   So I think a great litmus test for a lot of people
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.640]   for their investment strategy is,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.900]   are you willing to double down and lean into the pain
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.180]   when it is underperforming?
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.380]   Otherwise, what's the point of investing
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.220]   in it in the first place?
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.660]   Especially if it's something like an asset class.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.360]   If it's an individual stock,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.980]   I'm not picking on your stock picks, Duncan,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.740]   but if it is an individual stock like you
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.580]   and you're averaging all the way down,
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.260]   I don't have as much faith in that strategy
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.580]   as I do for an asset class or strategy
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.780]   that is more automatic and rules-based in nature.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.540]   - Well, you know, I can't remember if it was you or Michael
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.900]   that recently said on Animal Spirits
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.500]   something about how holding individual stocks
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   for the long run is actually almost certain
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.700]   to underperform for you as opposed to if you--
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.420]   - The probability goes against you.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.580]   - Yeah, I have an IRA that I should show you.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.840]   Definitely not sharing publicly,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.240]   but I gotta show you that basically it's data
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.760]   that you can use to prove that.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.600]   - Listen, I have a brokerage account at Robinhood
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.040]   and I have some stock picks.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.200]   I basically stopped picking stocks.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.440]   A few of them I've held onto
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.040]   and they've all done way worse
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.840]   than I would have just putting in index funds.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.520]   It is probably a good reminder
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   and I've sized it correctly.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.640]   But yeah, that's the thing.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.200]   The longer you're holding period
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.240]   in the stock market historically,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.040]   the better your chance of seeing gains.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.400]   The longer you're holding period for individual stocks,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.800]   the worse the probability is that you will actually see gains
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.760]   which is kind of hard to reconcile in your brain.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.520]   - I never knew that so many stocks
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.800]   could become penny stocks.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.480]   - The other part of it is mostly
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.360]   that it's a lot of big stocks that carry the day
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.880]   and make up the bulk of the returns.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.320]   It doesn't mean other stocks can't do well,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.560]   especially over certain time periods,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.420]   but it's just over the very long term,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.800]   most stocks don't do as well as you'd assume.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.640]   - Right.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.200]   - All right, next question.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.040]   - All right, up next--
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.480]   - No more Target Day Fun questions today.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680]   - Yeah, no more.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.240]   Stay tuned.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.520]   Okay, up next we have a question from Rick.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.760]   There's been a bull market and bond questions on the show,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.520]   so I thought I would take a stab.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.680]   Now that yields are higher,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.480]   I want more fixed income in my taxable account.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   We are retiring in the next five years.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.240]   Treasuries and T-bills seem like a no-brainer,
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.480]   but what about the tax implications?
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.040]   Corporate bonds have higher yields,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.920]   but is there a difference in how those bonds
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.520]   are treated tax-wise versus government bonds?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.080]   - Okay, so we got kind of like a good cop, bad cop question
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.540]   here between investing and taxes.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.420]   So I'll be the, I guess I'm the good cop,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.600]   the bad cop will be the tax guy.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.900]   Let's bring in Bill Sweet.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.180]   Talk about the tax side of things here.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.020]   - Hey, Bill.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.940]   - Gonna be live from New York City today, gentlemen.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.020]   How's it going?
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.860]   - Good, good.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.740]   Sorry, I had you muted there for a second.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.580]   - It's all good.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.140]   It's because I wasn't wearing a Fruity Purple shirt today,
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.100]   so the devil's got stayed home.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.500]   - Yeah, you guys are the good cop, bad cop.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.500]   Duncan is bright, Bill is black.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.880]   I do like this question 'cause we've been seeing
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.460]   a lot of comparisons lately of people saying,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.940]   listen, if I can get 6% in corporate bonds,
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.580]   why would I ever invest in the stock market?
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.460]   If I can get 8% in high yield,
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.780]   and I think if you're doing that in a tax deferred account,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.820]   that's an okay apples to apples comparison, maybe.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.880]   But if you're talking taxable account,
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.920]   the way that taxes on bonds and stocks are treated
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.760]   is much different.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.900]   So I think you have to be careful about that.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   And I think for most people,
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.180]   especially if you're approaching retirement,
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.460]   you want those bonds to be used for spending purposes
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.380]   or income, so you don't want them in a tax deferred account
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.260]   unless it's just for a portfolio over the longterm.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.220]   So what do you think the breakdown of bonds is
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.900]   by tax perspective?
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.340]   'Cause that changes the equation greatly, right?
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.220]   - Yeah, you make some great points, Ben.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.480]   And typically, if you're going into retirement,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.600]   you are trying to focus on income, and that's a great point.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.380]   However, bonds have this annoying feature
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.060]   where they're getting taxed at ordinary income.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.740]   A lot of the conversations we're having here on the show
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.280]   do deal with capital gains.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.340]   So let's talk a little bit
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.780]   about how different bonds get taxed.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.580]   John, can we pull up our first chart, please?
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.100]   Let's just take a quick look at how corporate
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.420]   versus treasury versus municipal bonds.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.700]   Those are the three types of bonds you can probably go out,
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.560]   and hopefully those are the three flavors
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.300]   that are available to you.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.520]   You can see there by the chart,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.460]   you're exposed to both federal and state income tax
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.220]   on any corporate bonds that you're purchasing.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.140]   And so, yes, those come with a higher yield.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.020]   However, you are looking at the proposition of higher tax,
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.140]   and we're gonna do some math for you.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.420]   We're gonna do some bond math
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   and let you know what that looks like here in a minute.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.280]   Moving on, treasury bonds come state tax-free,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.060]   which is awesome if you happen to live in New York,
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.960]   like I do, me and Duncan here in New York and Connecticut,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.660]   maybe not so much if you're in Michigan,
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.340]   certainly in California, pretty high-tax state.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.580]   However, you do have to pay federal income tax
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.900]   on your treasuries,
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.100]   or you can look at state-issued municipal bonds.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.060]   And if you're buying a municipal bond
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.540]   issued from the state or municipality
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.620]   that you happen to live in,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.140]   you get this triple tax exemption
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.700]   where your federal, state, and local taxes are free
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.460]   if you're buying an in-state bond.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.220]   And so that's how those break down.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.900]   John, can we flip over to chart two, please?
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.300]   - I like the table, Bill, that was good.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.040]   Before we get into the next one,
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.600]   it is interesting, like the treasury part of it,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.560]   I don't think a lot of people realize that,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.620]   like no state tax, a lot of this is,
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.920]   I mean, you've said this in the past,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.880]   usually when you retire,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.440]   your tax rate will go down, hopefully.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.280]   So for a lot of people,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.880]   maybe that helps the equation a little bit.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.320]   But I think having that matrix there
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.480]   is a good starter for people.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.240]   If you have a really ultra-high tax rate,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.400]   it could change the way that you allocate your bonds,
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.640]   or it should, probably.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.480]   - Yeah, precisely.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.120]   And I think you do have to think about that, Ben,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.640]   and great lead-in, by the way.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.060]   You're a great, great header for me,
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.400]   because you set me up, and I'll knock 'em down.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.240]   A lot of this--
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.120]   - I was a point guard in high school,
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.960]   so I like to dish out the assists.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.800]   - That's great.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.120]   I got to see Victor Wembiata last night,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.900]   and he could've used a point guard there for this part.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.300]   So let's flip over to chart two, John,
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.680]   and take a look at how these bonds go from a pre-tax yield.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.520]   So in the left column, a pre-tax yield,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.840]   let's say 6% for corporates, 5% for treasuries,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.360]   3.5% for municipals.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   These are roughly approximate to where yields are today,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.840]   and this is not investment advice,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.460]   so please don't act on this.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.080]   However, what I did, Ben, is I broke this down and said,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.680]   look, if you're a low-tax rate, if you're paying 12%,
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.560]   versus a mid-tax rate, paying 24% and let's say 6%
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.080]   for a total of 30%, versus a high-tax rate,
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.760]   let's say close to 50%, which is where folks are
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.120]   in New York City and California,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.800]   at the higher end of the income spectrum,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   what happens to those pre-tax yields
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.320]   as they filter through the tax equation?
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.640]   And instead of framing everything
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.680]   in a tax-equivalent yield,
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.600]   I want to talk about the yield that you take home, right?
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.840]   Because we do not eat pre-tax returns.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.720]   So this, to me, is very important.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.820]   You can see for, let's say, a middle taxpayer,
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.900]   a corporate bond, a pre-tax 6% yield gets cut to about 4%,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.340]   a pre-tax 5% treasury yield gets cut to 3.8%,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.060]   and municipals, again, assuming you're in-state,
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.580]   just stays at that 3.5% because they're completely tax-free.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.180]   So more or less, you can make that decision,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.820]   but what I want to highlight there is the rightmost column.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.980]   At some point, it begins, the higher your tax rate are,
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.160]   the more tasty, the more beneficial
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.060]   that tax-free yield is for municipals.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.120]   So it really does depend.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.100]   I do think you have to sit down and think about this.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.860]   Basis points are probably gonna make a huge difference,
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.500]   but if you're in the highest tax bracket,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.940]   your yield gets cut in almost half,
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.780]   and I think you do have to take that into account.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.260]   - So you'd probably say if you want to own corporate bonds
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.100]   and you're in high taxes,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.220]   you should probably be owning those in a tax-deferred
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.580]   account, otherwise it might not really make as much sense.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.340]   - I think so, very generally.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.460]   Yeah, that would be my take,
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.700]   because ultimately it's all tax-deferred anyway.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.540]   And furthermore, again,
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.340]   we're talking about ordinary income tax rates, right?
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.860]   So compared to capital gains, compared to dividends,
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.260]   you're paying the highest tax rates very quickly.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.540]   And so yes, I think for corporate yields,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.420]   for folks in a low tax bracket, for tax equivalents,
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.440]   it makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.900]   Municipals, if you're in a higher tax bracket.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.900]   - With treasuries, your T-bills are included in those.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.300]   They're free from state taxes, right?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.340]   'Cause a lot of people have been
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.340]   pouring into T-bills lately.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.220]   I want to get on munis,
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.300]   but Duncan, let's read question four first.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.780]   I think that actually is a muni question
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.620]   and we'll get to some tax equivalent stuff,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460]   which I think is important.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.460]   - Great question from Rick, thank you.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.900]   - Yeah, let's talk municipal bonds.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.300]   - Okay, you've written a lot about bonds lately,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.200]   but not munis.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.420]   I'm looking at a muni fund with a yield of 3.8%.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.260]   If I hold this in a taxable account,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.020]   that's a pretty good deal, right?
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.420]   How do I think about munis in the context of other bonds
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.140]   in a taxable brokerage account?
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.100]   - So I think psychologically speaking,
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.780]   munis are kind of difficult for people
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.980]   because you have to think about the tax equivalent.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.620]   The way you showed a bill in your matrix
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.100]   was you put them on the level playing field.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.660]   But if you inverted it and did it the other way,
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.020]   you could say, well, the nominal yield in treasuries
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.500]   versus munis might be similar too,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.420]   but for a lot of people, that's a phantom yield
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.460]   because the tax stuff for a lot of people happens later.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.700]   It doesn't happen right now.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.540]   And so they look and say,
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.660]   why would I take a 3.5% or 4% yield in munis
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.200]   when I can get 5% or 6% in these corporate bonds
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.420]   or treasuries or whatever, and it doesn't make sense.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.520]   So it's hard to put those on equal footing.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.340]   But as you said, especially if you're in a high tax bracket,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.180]   the municipal yield on a tax equivalent basis
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   might be even better.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.380]   - Yeah, could not agree.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.340]   And that would be the great title for a new "Star Wars"
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.580]   movie, "The Phantom Yield."
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.420]   I do like that, Ben, I'm gonna have to think about that.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.140]   But as you guys might imagine, we have a chart about this.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.900]   So John, can you pull up chart three?
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.980]   So this just illustrates the point,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.680]   and again, that we were making before,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.100]   and sort of connecting the dots between the questions.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.600]   Jim is questioning, why would I consider municipals?
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.100]   Again, it sets us higher tax rates.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.060]   That to me is where it starts to make sense
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.360]   in that you can see there, if we kind of, again,
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.080]   look at pre and low and mid and high tax yields,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.160]   how that plays out, municipals are gonna be dead even,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.940]   but the tax bite takes a higher hit
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.460]   out of those higher yield corporates and treasuries.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.540]   And so that, to me, is where that flip happens.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.940]   And Ben, I think municipals really start
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.140]   to make a lot of sense to me,
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.100]   roughly around the 35% tax bracket.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.900]   That's when the game changes.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.740]   Because around there, assuming you're in a high tax state,
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.020]   that's when your tax rate is pushing 40%, 42% all in,
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.300]   and that's when that thing flips.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.660]   And if you kind of look at this from the outside,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.260]   from an outside basis, the type of account,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.700]   the type of title makes a lot of sense.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.120]   You would not, for example, Ben,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.140]   wanna own municipal bonds in a tax deferred account,
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.860]   in an IRA or 401k, right?
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.620]   Because you're accepting a lower yield,
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.180]   but you're getting this tax deferral benefit there anyway.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.700]   So Jim's question is spot on,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.420]   and this is why I think looking at this
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.760]   in not just the tax equivalent angle,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.500]   but where you're gonna hold asset location
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.740]   is so, so important when you're doing asset allocation.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.860]   - So I feel like we're getting closer
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.460]   to Bill's rules of thumb.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.960]   We have a Roth IRA cutoff, we have a Muni bond cutoff.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.800]   We're getting there, right?
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.380]   Depending, again, you have to actually know
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.460]   what your tax rate is, which a lot of people probably don't.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.500]   But there is a financial planning element to owning bonds
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.820]   that you probably didn't have to think about before.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.340]   And again, I think this is probably more important
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.900]   for retirees or people who are using bonds for income.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.500]   If you're using bonds in a 401k plan
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.060]   because you want diversification
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.140]   or you don't wanna take as much equity risk,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.580]   this equation doesn't matter.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.380]   Then look at the nominal yields.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.340]   But I think for a lot of people,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.740]   and especially retirees, they are looking at these.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.380]   And I think that the handoff
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.660]   probably couldn't have gone better for retirees.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.060]   Yes, people were complaining in the 2010s
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.820]   'cause yields were low and bonds weren't doing much.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.740]   And then you had 2022, what we talked about earlier,
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.080]   where bonds got killed.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.380]   But you had stocks that totally picked up the slack
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.380]   and more than made up for the bond returns.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.980]   And now you have this situation
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.620]   where you can de-risk the portfolio
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.440]   and you have these nice yields.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.420]   And you just do have to be a little thoughtful
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.340]   about the way that you implement it.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.620]   Because to your point,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.620]   you don't wanna have the wrong asset location
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.620]   and then eat into a lot of your yield unnecessarily.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.380]   - Yeah, we've been in this higher interest rate environment,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.260]   higher inflation environment,
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.540]   been for, I don't know, 18, 24 months at this point.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.300]   I gotta be honest with you, I'm still adjusting.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.060]   I came into this industry in 2007,
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   fresh out of the Army, coming into tax.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.860]   And from that point forward,
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.420]   we've had sub-2% yields, sub-2% inflation.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.580]   So I'm still getting used to all this.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.420]   And that's why, Jim,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.700]   I think your question is very appropriate.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.820]   And this is the type of thing
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.000]   that the world changed in the last two years.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.320]   So I think your portfolio
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.820]   should potentially change along with it.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.660]   - Yes.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.620]   - I think you probably just have to be
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.460]   a lot more thoughtful
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.620]   about how you allocate your fixed income as well.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.220]   It's not a one decision asset class, really.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.560]   You have to kind of think through.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.400]   And maybe for some people,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.980]   it's a little bit of corporate bonds
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.820]   and a little bit of treasuries
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.640]   and a little bit of munis
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.100]   depending on the way they have their money.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.260]   But you just have to think through
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.740]   before you pull the trigger there.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.140]   - Right, amen.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.500]   - Duncan, what are oldie bonds paying these days?
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.420]   - Probably a lot.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.980]   - 27%, that's gotta be a high yield.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.620]   - Probably a lot, yeah, I don't know.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.980]   I mean, they technically, the earnings wasn't terrible.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.300]   - Okay, but I'm glad we talked about this
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.880]   in terms of taxes, because again,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.580]   people who are making these stock versus bond comparisons,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.500]   it really depends where those assets are located.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.260]   You can't just say, well, bonds are paying six,
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.240]   so why would I,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.500]   if I could get six in the stock market, I'd be fine.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.800]   It's a totally, what did you say yesterday to me?
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.860]   Bonds, you pay taxes now, stocks, you pay taxes later.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.700]   - Yeah, and that brings up a good point about compounding,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.900]   Ben, not only are you looking at a higher interest rate,
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.820]   or a higher tax rate for ordinary income,
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.180]   which most bonds are taxed at,
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.740]   but furthermore, there's some advantages
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.940]   to things like dividend yield.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.180]   Assuming, again, you're comparing apples to apples,
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.820]   which you're not, but in the case that you are,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.860]   and assuming you could predict
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.540]   the future path of stock returns,
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.140]   stock gains are usually deferred, right,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.260]   because you're paying capital gains,
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.480]   but you choose that moment when you sell
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.820]   and realize those gains.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.380]   And so if you're able to defer that two to five to 10 years,
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.220]   that compounding effect all happens within your portfolio
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.760]   relative to the bond income
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.420]   that you're paying tax on right now.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.900]   And so even if you're reinvesting,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.140]   let's say, into a bond fund,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.380]   assuming you're compounding that way,
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.040]   you're still paying tax at a higher rate
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.140]   with a bond fund today.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.540]   It's not apples to apples anyway,
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.580]   but yeah, there are some built-in advantages
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.420]   to tax deferral that come from stocks
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.100]   and come from tax-qualified dividends,
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.260]   which you're paying at lower tax rates.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.460]   - Duncan, Cliff in the chat says
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.740]   that you should be drinking a Coors
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.600]   based on your NASCAR gear.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.260]   I think that actually fits.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.280]   - Yeah, I'm drinking this tea,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.220]   but I think it kind of would look like a beer can maybe.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.060]   - He's a man of the people.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.680]   - One day, one day, that'll be the show.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.820]   - We got one more.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.940]   - Okay, last but not least,
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.940]   we have a question from John.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.260]   I was wondering if you could comment
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.900]   on the nuances of purchasing a home
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.400]   in a very high cost of living real estate market,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.060]   like New York City, San Francisco, LA.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.880]   I'm not sure how expensive San Francisco is.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.700]   - Did you get that on this first try, Duncan?
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.820]   V-H-C-O-L there?
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.180]   - It took me a second, but yeah,
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.900]   at first I was thinking like an EV toll,
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.740]   but yeah, this is different.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.100]   Okay, I'm coming from a more affordable area
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.980]   and I feel like the game in these places
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.300]   is vastly different.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.500]   The biggest thing I struggle with
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.100]   is how much to put down without feeling foolish.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.420]   Am I crazy for putting 60 to 70% down
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.860]   on a New York City property?
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.700]   I'm envisioning modest mortgage payments
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.180]   due to the 60 to 70% down payment,
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.160]   which could put me into a building
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.940]   where others only put 20% down or less,
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.820]   have to be earning at least two times or more
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.660]   what we would.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.500]   It's a little confusing,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.780]   but I think I get what they're saying.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.340]   The usual net worth statistics
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.100]   of not being so tilted into real estate
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.820]   don't seem to apply in very high cost of living areas.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.260]   If we put 70% down,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.160]   our net worth breakdown would be something like 60 to 70%
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.760]   into our primary residence real estate.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.740]   - Good question.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.580]   First of all, I think there's like
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.860]   an imposter syndrome thing going here
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.580]   where if I put 60 to 70% down
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.940]   and other people there aren't
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.620]   because their salaries are different,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.120]   I think it might be part of what we took out.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.180]   I would get rid of that immediately
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.020]   because if you can afford to put 60 or 70% down
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.300]   in a New York City house, apartment, condo, whatever,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.740]   you're in a pretty good position, right?
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.860]   Do you agree, though, Bill,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.240]   that the high cost of living areas
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.320]   are a totally different ballgame
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.860]   from a real estate perspective?
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.820]   - I don't necessarily, yeah.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.580]   My observation here with most real estate investors
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.720]   generally, Ben, is that they hate paying taxes
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.440]   more than they like making money.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.740]   And real estate involves this tax deferral
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.140]   I was just talking about a minute ago
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.580]   with capital gains and deferrals.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.880]   But to me, this isn't necessarily a tax question.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.660]   It's a concentration question, Ben.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.380]   And that's sort of what I think you're getting at.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.700]   If you are dumping 60 to 70% of your current net worth
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.700]   into a single property, in a single city,
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.580]   in a single building, literally,
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.260]   a lot could go wrong with that, right?
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.340]   We have lived in a world, most of my career,
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.620]   where real estate prices go up
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.780]   and they go up and they go up,
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.180]   and everybody thinks that's probably
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.480]   gonna happen going forward.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.180]   But I think the risk you're taking on
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.020]   by putting that amount of capital
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.480]   into one single asset, to me, is a lot.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.580]   And yes, you do get a lower mortgage,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.740]   you do pay less interest,
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.940]   you are gonna have a lower payment,
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.260]   and maybe, therefore, you can afford
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.180]   to live a little bit grander.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.180]   But it's a lot of risk.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.900]   It's a lot of risk to take on, Ben.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   - My whole thing about risk is
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.460]   that there are necessary or unavoidable,
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.900]   and then there are avoidable or unnecessary risks.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.580]   And if you wanna make money,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.340]   you can't avoid something like volatility,
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.880]   or there's some drawback.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.220]   And I think dumping all of your money
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.240]   into a single asset is an unnecessary risk,
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.400]   especially something like that,
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.360]   that's the roof over your head.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.740]   And if you can afford a down payment that high,
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.920]   you can probably afford the mortgage payments as well.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.080]   And there's nothing to say that if you hold back
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   and you just do a 30 or 40% down payment,
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.540]   there's nothing to say that you can try it out
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.920]   for a little while and see how you can afford it,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.000]   and then dump the money in in a few years,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.040]   potentially, and pay the principal down.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.200]   But if you put all the money in,
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.240]   then you're gonna have to borrow
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.500]   against the place to get it out,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.980]   so it's much harder to spend that place
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.520]   after the money's already in there.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.520]   So I don't see the rush to make such a huge down payment,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.880]   especially if it's gonna concentrate you so much.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.480]   It just seems unnecessary to me from a risk perspective.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.920]   - Yeah, I think I generally agree, Ben.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.920]   The other thing I'd sort of counsel
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.200]   anybody thinking about this on
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.880]   is that primary real estate,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.240]   especially if it's a personal loan,
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.440]   jumbo loan or not,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.080]   that is one of the few places, Ben,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.000]   where you can apply leverage effectively,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.440]   I think, as a taxpayer,
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.320]   in that there's this giant subsidized mortgage complex
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.400]   out there that's keeping real estate interest loans.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.800]   - You would never, it would never be wise
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.500]   to take that much leverage out in a stock market.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.340]   - Yes.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.160]   - But in the housing market,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.300]   we freely tell people to do it, have at it, right?
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.540]   - Right, and effectively,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.980]   what you're doing in that scenario,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.260]   in some form or fashion,
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.300]   is you're transferring some of that risk to a bank.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.180]   And so that, to me, is one way to potentially de-risk.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.000]   Ben, you hit the other nail on the head,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.880]   which is that it's not a one-way street.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.060]   If you get frustrated at that higher mortgage rate,
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.780]   you can always pay it down, right?
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.860]   You can always refinance down the road with cash.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.140]   That's always an option.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.260]   And it more or less keeps some powder dry.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.780]   And so I think I would consider that.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.520]   And I've always just considered that leverage play
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.260]   to be, again, one of the few places,
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.180]   that if you could go out and buy a million-dollar building
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.220]   and only put, let's say, $200,000, $300,000 down,
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.180]   that, to me, seems like a pretty good deal,
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.000]   even if my monthly payments are higher.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.960]   The additional cash that I'm holding back on,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.660]   and let's say investing in municipals, right,
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.860]   to earn some income, some revenue with,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.180]   I can use that to help decrease the mortgage, right?
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.900]   And so it ends up being in the leverage play.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.020]   - The only argument I could see
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.100]   for actually doing this kind of thing would be,
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.780]   listen, mortgage rates are 7.5%,
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.380]   and I'm gonna put it down,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.760]   and then if rates go back down to five,
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.820]   I'm gonna cash out refi and pull some of that back out.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.220]   That's a tough, that's like a market timing
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.760]   kind of thing as well, so that's difficult.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.280]   But you'd have that built-in equity,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.380]   where you could do that if you wanted to,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.340]   or take out a home equity line, or whatever,
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.060]   if rates fall, but that's a timing thing,
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.720]   and if you really need the money,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.860]   it could be that banks don't wanna give you a loan
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.100]   at that time, so that's a little bit of a riskier strategy.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   - But there is a tax angle I do wanna mention,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.160]   in that there are three itemized deductions
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.900]   that are available to individual taxpayers
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.340]   for their primary residence right now, right?
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.780]   It's charitable contributions, it's property taxes,
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.460]   but that's limited to $10,000,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.460]   which, in a city like New York, or VHOCL,
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.740]   I think that was the acronym. - Yeah, thanks.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.780]   - Yeah, they're astronomically high.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.340]   But the third is mortgage interest, right?
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.900]   And so, effectively, if you're able to tax-deduct
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.660]   your mortgage interest being paid,
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.060]   that effectively reduces the borrowing rate, right?
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.560]   So if you're at a 30% tax rate,
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.380]   that brings your tax-equivalent mortgage interest yield
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.500]   from 7% to 5 1/2, right?
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.740]   And so maybe that's not worth writing home about,
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.500]   that's nothing compared to two years ago,
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.960]   but we live in the world that exists now,
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.780]   and that is something, once you account
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.260]   for a standard deduction, that you can
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.100]   take advantage of, potentially.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.940]   - Yeah, good question, I just,
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.140]   it just seems unnecessarily risky to me
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.260]   to put that much in, if you don't have to.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.660]   - I think I generally agree.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.220]   - Yeah. - Make the bank do it.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.980]   - I think I generally agree, too.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.300]   I don't have a strong opinion.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   - Duncan is like a chameleon, he goes from F1 guy
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.900]   to NASCAR guy so seamlessly, right?
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.060]   - I mean, you know, they're cars.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.220]   - It is impressive, yeah.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.180]   Motors, engines, yeah, it's good.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.740]   - Four wheels, okay.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.300]   Great questions this week, as always,
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.260]   we appreciate everyone. - It was fun.
