[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   What's being developed in terms of treatments for stutter?
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:13.000]   Yeah, so we actually accidentally came across stuttering in songbirds and we've published
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   several papers on this to try to figure out the neurobiological basis.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.340]   The first study we had was a brain area called the basal ganglia, the striatum part of the
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.000]   basal ganglia involved in coordinating movements, learning how to make movements when it was
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.040]   damaged in the speech-like pathway in these birds.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.120]   What we found is that they started to stutter as the brain region recovered.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.480]   And unlike humans, they actually recovered after three or four months.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.680]   And why is that the case?
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.720]   Because bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis in a way that human or mammal brains don't.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   And it was the new neurons that were coming in into the circuit, but not quite, you know,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.340]   with the right proper activity, was resulting in this stuttering in these birds.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.840]   And after it was repaired, not exactly the old song came back after the repair, but still
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.280]   it recovered a lot better.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.520]   And it's now known, they call this neurogenics stuttering in humans, with damage to the basal
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.480]   ganglia or some type of disruption to the basal ganglia at a young age also causes stuttering
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.620]   in humans.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.400]   And even those who are born with stuttering, it's often the basal ganglia that's disrupted
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.260]   in some other brain circuit.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.200]   And we think the speech part of the basal ganglia.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.060]   Can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood repair that stutter?
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.140]   They can repair it with therapy, with learning how to speak slower, learning how to tap out
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140]   a rhythm.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.880]   And yeah, I'm not a speech pathologist, but I started reading this literature and talking
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.180]   to others that, you know, colleagues who actually study stuttering.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:11.620]   So yes, there are ways to overcome the stuttering through, you know, behavioral therapy.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.740]   And I think all of the tools out there have something to do with sensory motor integration.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.560]   Controlling what you hear with what you output in a thoughtful, controlled way helps reduce
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   the stuttering.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.300]   There are a couple of examples from real life that I want to touch on.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.100]   And one is somewhat facetious, but now I realize is a serious neurobiological issue.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.380]   This meaning, I think, interesting, which is that every once in a while, I will have
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.820]   a conversation with somebody who says the last word of the sentence along with me.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.620]   And it seems annoying in some instances.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.020]   But I'm guessing this is just a breakthrough of the motor pattern, that they're hearing
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.980]   what I'm saying very well.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.820]   So I'm going to interpret this kindly and think they're hearing what I'm saying.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.460]   They're literally hearing it in their mind.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.080]   And they're getting that low level electrical activity to their throat.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.780]   And they're just joining me in the enunciation of what I'm saying, probably without realizing
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.780]   it.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.980]   Can we assume that that might be the case?
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.940]   Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.740]   So that, you know, the motor theory of speech perception, where this idea originally came,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.260]   what you hear is going through your speech circuit, and then also activating those muscles
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.180]   slightly.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.420]   So yes, so one might argue, okay, is that speech circuit now interpreting what that
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.920]   person is speaking, now you listening to me, and is going to finish it off because it's
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.460]   already going through their brain, and they can predict it.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.660]   That would be one theory.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.620]   I don't think the verdict out there is no, but that's one.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:01.300]   The other is synchronizing turn-taking in the conversation, where you're acknowledging
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   that we understand each other by finishing off what I say, and it's almost like a social
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.200]   bonding kind of thing.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.500]   The other could be, I want the person to shut up so I can speak as well and take that turn.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.040]   And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.660]   And if you have somebody who's over-talkative versus under-talkative or vice versa, that
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.580]   rhythm can be lost in them finishing ideas and going back and forth.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.860]   But I think having something to do with turn-taking as well makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.860]   I have a colleague at Stanford who says that interruption is a sign of interest.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.780]   I'm not sure that everyone agrees.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.900]   I think it's highly contextual.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.140]   But there is this form of a verbal nod of saying, or things of that sort.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.380]   And there are many of these.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.820]   And I'm often told by my audience that I interrupt my guests and things of that sort.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.580]   Oftentimes I'll just get caught in the natural flow of the conversation.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.780]   I think we've had pretty good turn-taking here, I hope.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.780]   So far, so good.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.780]   I feel that way.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780]   I'm glad you feel that way.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.700]   Because especially in the context of a discussion about language, this seems important.
