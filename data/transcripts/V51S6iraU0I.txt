[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.360]   - Good Monday morning, and thank you for joining us again
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.120]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.180]   We start this new week with a great Bible question
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.960]   here today from a listener named Bill.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.880]   It's the kind of question that drops us right
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960]   into a discussion over how our hearts work.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.320]   Here's Bill's question.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.120]   Pastor John, hello, can you explain to me 1 Peter 2.11
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.480]   and how these passions of the flesh
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.880]   actually wage war against the soul?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.740]   How do these passions threaten the soul?
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.360]   Can you explain how all of this works?
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560]   - Well, let's start by clarifying a few words
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.420]   in this verse.
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320]   For example, the word passions urge you to abstain
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.140]   from the passions of the flesh.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.140]   The word is simply desires, epithumeon.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.860]   They can be good desires in some contexts.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.460]   Or they can be bad desires.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.460]   The word itself doesn't decide whether they're good or bad.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.220]   What decides that in this verse is the added phrase
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.020]   of the flesh.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.660]   Abstain from the desires of the flesh.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.980]   But even that is not a full explanation
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.820]   of why the desires would be so destructive
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.220]   and make war on the soul.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.640]   So what does flesh mean?
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   How does the term flesh make its desires bad and dangerous,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.620]   destructive to the soul?
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.540]   The word flesh can mean simply the human body, as it does.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.420]   For example, in 1 Peter 4.1, where it says
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900]   that Christ suffered in the flesh.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.900]   There's nothing evil about Christ's flesh, his body.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   And so not all desires of the body or the flesh
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.180]   would necessarily be evil, right?
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.580]   Jesus had the desire for food when he was hungry.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.940]   He had the desire for water when he was thirsty.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.020]   He had the desire for rest when he was tired.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.020]   These desires of the body or the flesh are not evil.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.460]   But the word flesh in the New Testament
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.900]   has other meanings as well.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.300]   For example, Paul uses it to define the rebellious mind
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.000]   of the fallen human nature in Romans 8.7,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500]   where he says the mind of the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.020]   The mind of the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.660]   It does not submit to God's law.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.900]   Indeed, it cannot.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.160]   And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.020]   So the flesh is seen as that part of human nature,
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.020]   which is without the Holy Spirit and in the sway of sin
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.660]   and cannot submit to God.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   Flesh is man in rebellion, without God, without the Spirit.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.120]   So what makes the desires of the flesh evil and dangerous
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.460]   is when they cross over from being innocent wishes
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.580]   for food and drink and rest or any legitimate pleasure,
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.580]   cross over into the service of the rebellious human self.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.540]   Or another way to say it would be
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.940]   the desires of the flesh become evil
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.940]   when they are disconnected from the will of God
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.100]   and become sovereign or independent with their own will,
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.100]   their own desires that don't have any reference
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.260]   to God's desires or God's will.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.540]   I will be satisfied and I don't care what God says
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.500]   about the guidance or the limits of my desires.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.740]   I will have my satisfaction of my desires,
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900]   my way, my time, my degree,
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.820]   without any submission to God's will.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.900]   That's the desires of the flesh.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.440]   So when the desires of the body,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.220]   which themselves may be innocent,
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.100]   become sovereign and independent of God,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.100]   now the soul is enveloped in a sea of desires
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.140]   that are communicating to the soul continually
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.380]   that it should join them in the pursuit,
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.380]   not of God, but of this world as the source of satisfaction.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.660]   And that is idolatry and that is deadly and destructive.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.260]   That is war on the soul.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.500]   Now you can see this understanding
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.180]   of fallen, sinful human desires
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.940]   a little ways later in 1 Peter,
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.220]   over in chapter four, verse three, where it says this.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.380]   We are to live for the rest of the time in the flesh,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.380]   that is the body, no longer for human desires,
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.580]   but for the will of God.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.020]   Now desires, therefore, become destructive
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.540]   when they are disconnected from the will of God.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.380]   They become sovereign, not subject to God,
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.540]   not subject to anybody.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.860]   They are their own law.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.260]   They will decide for themselves who their God will be
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.860]   and where their satisfaction will be found.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.460]   And they do not want God to have anything to do with it,
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.700]   especially as the source of their satisfaction.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.340]   And this is what Peter is warning against
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.220]   in chapter two, verse 11.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.220]   The reason such renegade, untethered, insubordinate,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.820]   sovereign desires wage war against the soul
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.620]   is that the life of the soul
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.020]   is found in being satisfied with God.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.460]   But when desires are cut loose from God
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.300]   and go after every other kind of idol,
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.980]   the soul is starved of what gives it life,
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.380]   namely dependence on God, satisfaction in God,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.380]   delight in God, feeding on God for its life and joy in God.
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.860]   And we get an even clearer picture
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.420]   of what this warfare is like
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.740]   when we consider how Peter describes the rescue
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620]   of the soul from such warfare or destruction.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.940]   Here's what he says in chapter one, verse 14.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.300]   As obedient children, do not be conformed
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.300]   to the desires of your former ignorance.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.540]   That's an amazing phrase.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.860]   Notice that what we need to be set free from
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.540]   is desires that flow from ignorance.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.540]   That is, ignorance of the superior worth and beauty
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.900]   and greatness of God and all that he is for us in Christ.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.540]   When we don't know the infinite desirability of God
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.940]   and how he's for us in Christ,
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.660]   our desires will inevitably latch onto lesser things
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.380]   and drag the soul down away from Christ.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.660]   So the way out of soul destroying
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.660]   into soul saving truth is to see Christ
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.180]   and have a true knowledge of him and his beauty
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.340]   and his worth so that the soul embraces him
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.340]   and with him a whole new constellation of desires.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.260]   Peter describes this in chapter one, verse seven.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.100]   Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.940]   Though you do not now see him, you believe in him
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.860]   and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.220]   and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith,
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.820]   the salvation of your souls.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.420]   This is counter warfare, right?
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.540]   This is the opposite of the destruction of the soul.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.340]   Finding Jesus infinitely worthy of love,
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.660]   finding Jesus infinitely worthy of believing
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.900]   and so you rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.580]   and filled with glory.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.300]   This is the salvation, not the destruction of the soul
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.100]   because faith sees Christ for who he is,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.180]   loves him, rejoices with inexpressible, glorious joy
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.180]   and so attaches the soul to its life.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.180]   The source of all its true and everlasting pleasures.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.500]   In other words, we're not in the grip
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.380]   of the desires of ignorance anymore.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.940]   We are in the freedom of the desires rooted
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.580]   in true knowledge of Christ's glory.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.300]   So our counter attack on the desires of the flesh
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.260]   that wage war against the soul, our souls,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.260]   is to pursue a true knowledge
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.740]   of the infinitely desirable Christ
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.580]   and then to obey this truth by embracing it as our treasure,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.500]   embracing him as our treasure and rejoicing
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.620]   with inexpressible and glorified joy.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.740]   That's the battle that we fight.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.260]   The desires of the flesh draw us away
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.420]   from the all satisfying Christ,
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.420]   but God opens our eyes and draws us to the true glory
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.820]   and the one warfare leads to destruction.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.820]   The counter attack of truth leads to salvation.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.900]   - The desires of the flesh draw us away
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.780]   from the all satisfying Christ.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.420]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.740]   And thank you, Bill, for listening
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.700]   and for asking this question.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.580]   And thanks to all of you for joining us today.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.820]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.620]   search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.100]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.500]   All right, well, I hope you have not had your fill
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.900]   of 1 Peter 2 11 in this episode.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.660]   I certainly have not myself.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.740]   Next time we're gonna look at this text
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.700]   and the next verse, 1 Peter 2, verses 11 and 12,
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.340]   because in those two verses,
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.180]   we will find the answers to the two greatest questions
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.940]   faced by the universe.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.020]   It's no joke, it's that epic.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.860]   Pastor John will prove it next time.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.700]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.540]   See you then.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.140]   (upbeat music)
