[00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.080]   - Man, Johnny, tell us, before we hop off here,
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.680]   tell us one story you've never told on a podcast
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.960]   about those college days,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.600]   and just those days that people are so curious about your life.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.760]   Tell us a story.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.480]   - You gotta tell him, you know, when he, this is true,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.800]   he pulled up to the UT, the rival of A&M.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.040]   Didn't you pull up to the UT frat house?
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   - That's a good one.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.640]   - That is the best, that is the funniest thing of all time.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.480]   - That's a really good one.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   So, a lot of my boys, you know, and me growing up,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.720]   I was a huge Texas fan, I wanted to go to UT.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.960]   A lot of my best friends from high school went to UT.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   So, 'cause I redshirted my first year,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.280]   and they have their spring parties going on,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.680]   they're a bunch of Kappa Sigs, and SAEs,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.120]   and different fraternities.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.200]   So I went down for a weekend for their big parties.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.040]   - The rival college.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.240]   - And had the best time ever, but I'm a redshirt.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.480]   Nobody really knows who I am.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.800]   Like, I played against a guy named Malcolm Brown
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.840]   in high school, was an unbelievable running back.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.720]   Like, guys who I had known and competed against went to Texas.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.880]   So, you know, we were still good dogs.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.680]   Played unbelievable battles against each other in high school.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.560]   And like, went, had the best time ever, rocked it,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.120]   slept on the floor of the fucking SAE house, and it was sick.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.240]   Like, I start that year, go play, win the Heisman.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.040]   The next spring comes around.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'm like, we're fucking doing Fiji Island again, duh.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   - Yeah.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   - We're like going to the mall before the game.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.640]   My boy buys a fucking Aaron Hernandez jersey.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.720]   I buy a Tim Tebow jersey, 'cause I thought it would be fucking hilarious
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.840]   to go party and drink a thousand beers in a Jets Tim Tebow jersey.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   And I walk into this party, and, fuck, man.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040]   They have a bunch of floaty, like, pools and, like, hay bales around it.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920]   And it's like a foam party and stuff.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.120]   And, you know, I'm sitting on one of the hay bales.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm talking with my boys who play at UT.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   And this fucking guy walks by me, and he fucking bumps me.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.200]   And I, like, fucking fall and, like, put one foot into the pool.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   And I kind of walk by, and I, like, let it slide.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.240]   I'm like, fuck it, whatever.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.600]   My shoe's fucking soaked.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.360]   I'm getting a little pissed.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.520]   And then the fucking guy comes back, bro,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.880]   and hits me with a fucking shoulder check again.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   This time, both feet in the water.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.040]   And I sit there for a minute, and the guy, like, walks around all the hay bales,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.280]   and he's going to the other side.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880]   And I just walk through every one of these pools.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.720]   Just fucking walk right across, bro.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760]   And he's walking like this.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.200]   And I just fucking crow hop, and boom!
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.680]   Fucking knock him out, bro.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.320]   His arms go fucking stiff, and he falls into the fucking floaty pool.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   And I'm like-- and I just walk straight out the door.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.000]   Damn.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   So then I think it was, like, the next year,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   I go back to the same party.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.080]   This guy's, of course, in the same fucking fret, dude.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160]   And I walk in, and I'm there for maybe, like, 30 minutes.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.920]   And you start to hear a little whispers.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.760]   They're starting to fucking gang up and shit.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.640]   And they're like, yo, you need to get the fuck out of here.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.600]   I'm like, what?
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.920]   You need to get the fuck out of here.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.480]   And they're all standing up on the balcony, and they're loaded up with fucking beers.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.760]   And they just start making it fucking rain at me, throwing it.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.600]   I, like, have two of my boys.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.800]   They, like, put my arm around them.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.480]   We walk out, like, walk out into the street.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   And then 20 dudes come out.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   And I'm with four of my boys from fucking Kerrville.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.880]   And it was one of those moments where they kind of, like, surround you.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.280]   And we're all back-to-back against each other.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.480]   And we're like, we fucking-- let's get it fucking popping.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.040]   Let's go.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   This is what it's all about.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   We, like, fucking-- we're squaring up, like, waiting for somebody to do something.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.680]   And finally, like, nothing really happened.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.640]   And we just walk down the street and go back to our own frat house.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   And, like, that was the end of the story.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   But I wake up the next day on TMZ, you know, fucking beers raining down,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   walking out of the fucking frat house.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.000]   Like, just all kinds of fucking shit started.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   Like, Manziel partying in a fucking Tebow jersey.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.480]   And then my boy has his fucking sunglasses hanging down on his nose.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.440]   He's in an Aaron Hernandez jersey, and he's just so fucked up.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   And everybody called him sunglass shithead for, like, the rest of his life.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.040]   And it went fucking viral forever.
