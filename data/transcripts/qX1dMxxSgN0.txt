[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   - Right now, I am so excited to welcome
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.460]   Victor Hagani to the stage.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.200]   Victor is the co-author of a book
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.840]   called The Missing Billionaires,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.640]   A Guide to Better Financial Decisions.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   We had Victor on our Morningstar podcast earlier this year
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.440]   and had such a great conversation with him.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.320]   He founded Elm Wealth, which is a very low-fee
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   investment advisory firm for high-net-worth individuals.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.920]   He started his career at Salomon Brothers in 1984,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800]   where he became a managing director
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.480]   in the Bond Arbitrage Group.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.120]   And in 1993, he was a co-founding partner
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.680]   of Long-Term Capital Management,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.200]   and we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.760]   He graduated from the London School of Economics
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180]   with a bachelor's degree in economics.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.040]   Victor, if you can come on up here,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.800]   and please welcome Victor.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.600]   So just pick up a mic of your choice.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.160]   Maybe I'll sit here.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.360]   - Great.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   Hello.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   Turn it on, right?
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   Okay. - Yeah.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   Victor, thank you for being here.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.080]   - Thank you so much, Christine.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.120]   - So let's talk about your book, The Missing Billionaires.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   You did a calculation that there should be
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   about 16,000 old-money billionaires alive today,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   but there are virtually none on the Forbes 2022 list
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560]   of 700 US billionaires.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   So can you talk about what went wrong
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.840]   for these individuals so that they did not
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480]   hang on to their fortunes?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.320]   - Sure.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.480]   So we start off the book by talking about this example
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.400]   of there were so many, quite a few wealthy families,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.280]   125 years ago in 1900,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.400]   and if they had just invested and matched the return
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   of this US stock market and paid taxes
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.200]   and spent some of their money in a reasonable way,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.220]   and had children at a reasonable sort of normal pace,
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.200]   there would be all these billionaire families today
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.160]   from those early families, but they're not.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.800]   And we don't know exactly what went wrong
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   or what went right from a societal point of view
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.160]   to not have so many of these billionaires,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   but our feeling is that the mistakes that people made,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.760]   the financial mistakes that people made
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   were mostly around risk and spending,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   and that they took more risk in their investments
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360]   and didn't match their family spending policies
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000]   with the risk in their portfolio.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   So a lot of concentrated portfolios,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400]   a lot of these wealthy families made their money
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.760]   in some particular business,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.300]   like the Vanderbilts in transportation.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.120]   And by 1950, the Vanderbilts still were mostly invested
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   in railroads and transportation,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   which didn't go too well for them.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.820]   And we have this little toy example
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.480]   that we like to talk about that really illustrates
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.200]   how this mismatch between spending risk
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.240]   and investment risk can really go wrong
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   and how risk eats into compound returns.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.300]   In our example, it's very simplified,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.240]   and it's only got two numbers in it.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.880]   Imagine that you build an investment portfolio
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.820]   where you feel that the expected return of your portfolio
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.580]   is 5% above inflation per annum.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.240]   That's the average annual return,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.200]   not the compound return, but the average annual return.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.760]   And then you decide, okay,
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   let's say I have a million dollars.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   I'm gonna spend 4% of that for the rest of my life,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   but 4% adjusted for inflation from that starting point.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.820]   And you're like, well, that doesn't sound too bad.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.260]   I mean, my expected return is 5%,
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.520]   so I should be able to spend this 4% number
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   to begin with, $40,000 for the rest of my life
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   adjusted for inflation.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.740]   But let's say that that portfolio is a really risky one
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.200]   because you picked a small set of stocks
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.860]   that you really like, but it's risky.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.420]   Maybe it goes up and down by 30% a year,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.700]   twice as risky as the stock market.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120]   Well, now the question is, after 25 years,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.340]   what's the most likely amount of wealth that you will have?
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.760]   And the answer to that is zero.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.460]   You're expected to go bankrupt.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.840]   You will not make it 25 years on,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.080]   you know, in more than 50% of the cases, you're bankrupt
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   because the volatility, that 30% volatility
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.820]   is just killing your compound return.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.460]   And you just keep on spending that $40,000 each year.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.360]   So, you know, we think that that's a really big explanation
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.040]   for what happened over time to many of these wealthy,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.460]   dynastically wealthy families.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.280]   - So let's talk about the key lessons
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   that Boglehead should take away from that history lesson.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   What lessons should we internalize as investors?
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.260]   And also, what are the key mistakes that we avoid,
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.100]   should avoid?
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.420]   You mentioned excessive risk-taking, profligate spending,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.300]   I'm sure factored into many of these losses over time,
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.420]   but maybe talk about those things.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.840]   - Yeah, well, I think that we, Bogleheads,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.600]   I'm really glad to count myself in there,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.820]   that we're avoiding, you know,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.580]   as part of our central thinking,
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.040]   we're avoiding most of the big mistakes.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   So, you know, being really thoughtful about risk
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.440]   by being sort of maximally diversified,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.000]   being really conscious of costs,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.360]   the cost matters hypothesis, really important.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.280]   So those are the, you know,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.680]   those are the things that we all know about.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.480]   I think some of the extra things that are really important
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.320]   are around thinking about spending,
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.900]   where I think that we need to have spending policies
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.460]   as individuals and families
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.220]   that are connected to our investment policies.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.540]   So I don't think that we can have 70% of our money
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.460]   in equities and then have a spending policy
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.460]   where we're trying to spend a fixed amount of money
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.860]   adjusted for inflation each year,
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.780]   that our spending policy is inexorably linked
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.460]   to the risk that we're taking in our portfolios.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.180]   And, you know, this isn't any kind of original thinking,
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.260]   you know, it's something that's been, you know,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.860]   in the literature since the late 1960s.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.500]   - Yeah, I wanna follow up on
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.020]   some of what you just talked about, Victor,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.480]   but while we are still on these individuals
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.280]   and their families who lost their fortunes,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   I think a real life question that a lot of individuals
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   in this room grapple with, they have children,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   they have grandchildren perhaps,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   and they want to try to pass wealth to them
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.860]   the question is how to do that without spoiling the kids,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.980]   how do they inculcate their kids
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.380]   in being sensible about money?
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.880]   - Sure, so I think as is often the case,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.260]   Warren Buffett, you know, has a really pithy statement
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.900]   about it where he says, you know,
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.540]   I wanna leave my kids or give my kids enough money
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.340]   so they can do anything, but not enough,
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.000]   but not so much that they can do nothing.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.880]   I don't think he actually followed that advice, but okay.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   But I think that's a good way of thinking about it,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.540]   and, you know, I mean, I'm a parent,
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.320]   I have three kids, 30, 28, 25,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.340]   and, you know, my wife and I, you know,
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.340]   our number one priority in our lives
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.900]   has been devoting ourselves
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.740]   to the upbringing of these children,
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.180]   and I think that it's really kind of,
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.020]   would be weird if somehow we just decided
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.960]   to stop helping them or wanting to help them,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.400]   you know, once they become 18 or 22 or whatever.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.240]   So I think it's natural to wanna help your kids
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   through life, but, you know, I think that, you know,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.480]   definitely too much financial help, you know,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.240]   can really be destructive.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.280]   Now, luckily, you know, I think that,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.120]   you know, if, you know, luckily in some ways
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.520]   that, you know, passing wealth to our kids
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.040]   is really expensive between, you know, taxes
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.620]   and, you know, the fact that the, you know,
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.300]   rate of return on safe and risky assets
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.200]   is not that high these days.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.560]   So, you know, like if you wanna try to help your kids
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.120]   and maybe grandkids, you know, to the tune of,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.040]   say $50,000 a year of help in some ways after tax,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.680]   like that takes a tremendous amount of wealth
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.760]   to support that.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   So anyway, but I think that, you know, good question.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.960]   I think that, yeah, I think, you know, as I say,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.760]   I think that one statement by Mr. Buffett
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.440]   is pretty good in terms of how I and my wife
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.640]   like to think about it.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.560]   - That's helpful.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.180]   So I want to switch over to portfolios and planning
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.440]   because you were involved in that in your day job
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.740]   in managing people's portfolios.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.200]   Most bogleheads, I would say, use a strategic buy,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   hold and rebalance approach to their portfolios.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.080]   They keep things pretty simple.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.720]   Yet at your firm, Elm Wealth,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   you do use a dynamic asset allocation strategy.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.120]   Can you talk about that?
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   How you decide whether to make changes
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.720]   in client portfolios?
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.280]   - Yeah, I think that's a, you know,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.840]   it's a really interesting question.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.980]   Actually, when we started Elm Wealth,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.120]   we applied to the patent office
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   for the term dynamic index investing
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.600]   to get a trademark for that.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.440]   And we heard back from the patent office
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they said, we're gonna give you that trademark
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   because it just doesn't make sense.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.360]   You know, index investing is passive.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.400]   You know, it's sort of, it sounds like an oxymoron
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.660]   to us here at the U.S. Patent Office.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.020]   Isn't index investing meant to be passive and not dynamic?
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:23.560]   So in order to make investment decisions,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.480]   we need to know the expected return
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.400]   of the different things that we're investing in
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.880]   and the risk of them.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.800]   And we also need to have an idea
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.040]   of our own personal degree of risk aversion.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.280]   So that's really the only way that I can think of
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.480]   of making portfolio decisions.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.840]   You know, what's the expected return
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.800]   of the different things we can invest in,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   their risk, and our personal risk aversion.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.400]   So we need those things.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.680]   Now, if the expected return and risk
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.480]   of the different things that we're investing in
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.040]   never change, then you would have a stat,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   you would decide what those numbers are
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.380]   and your risk aversion, I'm gonna assume, is stable.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.120]   Then you would say, okay, the expected returns
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.200]   are constant, the risk is constant.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.280]   I'm just gonna figure out the optimal
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.600]   portfolio allocations for me.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.760]   I'm done, and that's it.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.960]   And then they stay the same forever
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.560]   because the expected return is staying the same
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.720]   and the risk.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.760]   But nobody believes that.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.040]   I don't understand that nobody believes
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.420]   that the expected returns of all the different things
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.280]   are constant through time.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.120]   For one thing, we see interest rates
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.520]   changing every single day.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.360]   Real interest rates on tips go up and down, up and down.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   I mean, we know that the expected returns are changing.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.040]   We also know that risk is changing.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.920]   That the stock market in early 2020 was wildly risky.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   And at other times, like right now,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.440]   it's not very risky at all.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   It's not bouncing around a lot.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.840]   It's in a more sedate mode.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   So we know that the risk is changing.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.960]   And we also have a view about the expected return
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.040]   of equities, and the expected return of equities
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.640]   is also changing over time.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.840]   And it is possible to observe it and to estimate it.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.800]   We'll talk about that, I think, in a moment.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.560]   But you could go to Vanguard's website
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.440]   and they have a page called Capital Market Assumptions.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.920]   And right there, you just go there
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.520]   and it says expected return US equities for the next 10
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.800]   or 30 years is whatever, 6%.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.560]   Expected return of non-US equities for the next 10
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.400]   or 30 years you choose is whatever, 8%.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   Expected return of bonds, 4%.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.920]   And those numbers are changing every six months.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.360]   So why shouldn't they be part of our asset allocation decision?
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.080]   Now, it might be that people say,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   I just don't have time for that.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.240]   And I think that's reasonable.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.840]   That's a reasonable response to say,
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.720]   I don't have time for that.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.840]   I'm just going to go with something static.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.040]   Maybe I'll revisit it every five or 10 years.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.400]   But I think that, from a logical point of view,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.560]   that you have to-- that it makes sense
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.080]   that it should change if you're willing to spend
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.640]   the time chasing down these expected returns and risks.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   So just a quick follow up on that.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   If I don't want to spend a lot of time
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.880]   monkeying with my portfolio, would just
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.360]   a simple annual rebalancing address some of the things
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.720]   that you're talking about where I'm periodically stripping back
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.120]   what has performed really well and adding to the things that
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.880]   haven't performed as well?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.120]   I think that there's a spectrum of things
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.880]   that we can do with our wealth.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.040]   And what most people are-- not in this room,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.440]   but what most people in the world are doing is over here.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.680]   And it's not very good.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.320]   And then over here would be a static asset allocation,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.200]   maybe rethinking things over once a year,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.560]   or even once every five year, that's over here.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.880]   And then what I'm saying--
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   I don't know if you remember where that hand was.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.680]   And I'm saying that maybe over here
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.120]   is the best that you could do if you really feel like it.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.920]   But it's so close.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.120]   We're really close in here.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.040]   I mean, the main thing is be diversified.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.280]   Keep the costs down.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   Keep the taxes down.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.140]   Spend appropriately.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.760]   And then you're all the way over here.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.640]   Now, whether you go here or not, I
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.400]   don't think that's where the juice is.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.320]   It's getting from over here with all this crazy stuff
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.420]   and getting over here.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.160]   OK, so stay away from over here.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.480]   Yeah, OK.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.400]   So I wanted to ask, you alluded to the fact
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.280]   that you think about where the long-term real return of the US
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.880]   market is.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.040]   And to arrive at that, you use cyclically adjusted earnings
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.600]   yield.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.000]   I'm wondering if you can talk about, A, what that is,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.160]   and B, where that puts us today in terms of the broad market.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   So cyclically adjusted earnings yield is--
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.240]   well, it's an idea that goes all the way back to Benjamin Graham's
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.280]   1940s book.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.520]   But it was really repopularized by Bob Schiller and John
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.400]   Campbell in the late '80s, just saying that, look,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.640]   if you're buying equities, it's like buying an apartment
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.560]   building or a commercial building.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.260]   You're looking at your income and dividing it
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.400]   by the price that you pay.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.320]   That's your earnings yield or your rental yield.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.280]   And that's as good of a long-term predictor
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.880]   of the real return on that investment
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   that we can come up with, at least in terms
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.800]   of a simple and decent expected return estimator.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   It's like, OK, I'm putting money into the stock market.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.760]   If companies paid out all their earnings as dividends each year,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.600]   which they don't, but if they did,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.040]   then the belief is that companies in aggregate
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.480]   would be able to keep the earnings constant in real terms.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.340]   And that gives us this tie-in between earnings yield
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.160]   and the long-term expected real return of the stock market.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.640]   Today, the cyclically adjusted earnings yield,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.520]   which is basically just looking at the last 10 years of earnings
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.200]   adjusted for inflation.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.280]   We could also adjust it for payout ratios
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.740]   to get a slightly better estimate,
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.440]   but not a big difference.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.880]   So right now, for US equities, broad US equities,
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.780]   the cyclically adjusted earnings yield is around 3 and 1/2%.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.680]   And of course, tips are around--
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.840]   tips are just under 2%.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   So the expected excess return of US equities
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.080]   relative to the safe asset of tips is about 1 and 1/2%.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.640]   Not very high, not very exciting.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.720]   For non-US equities, that spread between tips
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.800]   and the earnings yield is closer to 5%.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.840]   And actually, Vanguard, on Vanguard's website--
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.360]   and everybody, all the big investment firms
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.120]   have a capital markets assumption page.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.280]   You could go to BlackRock's, Goldman Sachs, whatever.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.720]   But we love Vanguard.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.040]   And Vanguard's numbers are pretty similar to what
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.460]   you would get from earnings yield.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:08.720]   They do a much more complicated analysis, much more opaque,
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.600]   maybe better.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.520]   But the numbers come out almost the same
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   as just using cyclically adjusted earnings yield.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.000]   OK, thank you.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.800]   You alluded to this gulf between US, non-US.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.900]   It's been kind of persistent where
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.160]   most firms do believe that the return
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.600]   expectations for non-US look better over the next decade
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.520]   than US.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.800]   So what kind of international allocation
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.000]   do you think makes sense for the average investor?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.080]   And I'm wondering, is the global market capitalization
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.460]   like using a Vanguard total world stock index?
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.440]   Is that a good way to think about it?
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.140]   Or if not using the fund, at least using it
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.400]   to set my US, non-US allocation?
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.240]   Or how should people approach it?
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   I think that's a really good starting point.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.200]   I think using these--
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.880]   they're adjusted market caps, actually,
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.800]   because FTSE and MSCI really haircut the market
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.000]   cap of a lot of non-US markets for investability and values
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.920]   and so on.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.400]   So yeah, I think market cap weight isn't too bad.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.160]   That's around 60-40 right now, 60% US, 40% non-US.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.280]   There's lots of arguments out there.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.760]   I heard Rick yesterday talking about US versus non-US.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.640]   There's all kinds of arguments you can make about what's
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.280]   better or not.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.480]   Some of the arguments, one in particular
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.720]   of the many different ones that I think is interesting
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.480]   is probably like 20 or 30 years ago,
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.520]   both Mr. Bogle and Warren Buffett said to US investors,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.140]   don't worry about the rest of the world.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.640]   Who cares?
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   Just invest in US stocks.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.920]   After all, the S&P 500 gets 30%, 40% of its revenue and profits
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.280]   from outside of the US.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.620]   It's international.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.960]   And that was a good point.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.080]   But things are so different today in the sense
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.920]   that now if you own the S&P 500, that 40% of earnings
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.880]   that's coming from the rest of the world,
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.240]   you're paying a US multiple for that.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.680]   And for non-US companies, they're
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.160]   making 30% of their money in the US.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.560]   And you get to buy that earnings stream at the non-US multiple,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.640]   which is much lower.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.040]   So the arguments of Buffett and Bogle from 20, 30 years ago
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.800]   are actually now arguments against investing in the S&P
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.480]   500 to get your international exposure.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.040]   You referenced TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.160]   earlier.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.120]   And you think that they should be investors' minimum risk
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.320]   asset in lieu of cash and other cash-like investments.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.080]   Can you discuss the thesis there and also
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.040]   kind of the practical implications
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.680]   if I were to do that?
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.400]   What we've seen in periods of equity market volatility
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.520]   is that TIPS have been more volatile, certainly.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.920]   I mean, they have risk, and cash does not.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.240]   So maybe just follow up on that.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.320]   So I think we should measure our wealth not
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.080]   as the present value of our wealth,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.960]   but as the long-term real consumption
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.360]   that our wealth can support.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.160]   And going back 150 years or so, that's
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.200]   how people used to talk about how wealthy somebody was.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.800]   Like in Jane Eyre or whatever, they
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.040]   would say, oh, that Mr. Darcy, he's worth $10,000 a year.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.600]   They didn't say he's worth whatever, $200,000
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.880]   of present value in his brokerage account.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.440]   He was worth $10,000 a year or whatever.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.600]   And I think that's the sensible way.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.200]   I mean, counting our wealth in our brokerage account
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   is not a valid use of our wealth.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.560]   It's just spending it or giving it away over time.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.120]   So if the real measure of our wealth
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.800]   is the long-term spending power that it can generate,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.600]   then it's kind of clear why something like TIPS
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.840]   is going to be the minimum risk asset.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.760]   Now, just because it's the minimum risk asset
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.840]   doesn't mean that you need to own any of it.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.200]   So when TIPS were trading at minus 1 and 1/2% real yield,
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.960]   where you were locking in a minus 1 and 1/2%
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.680]   or you were locking in a loss of purchasing power of 1
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.960]   and 1/2% per year, you might have said, OK,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.880]   it's my minimum risk asset.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.640]   But I don't want to own any of it because it stinks.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.280]   And so I think that it still is reasonable to say,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   that's my minimum risk asset.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   But I'm going to take some more risk and own treasury bills.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.080]   So now treasury bills are riskier than TIPS because TIPS
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.160]   is the minimum risk asset.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.580]   But it's like, OK, you know what?
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.360]   I'm going to own treasury bills because I
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.440]   think that treasury bills are going to do a lot better
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.600]   than TIPS, for instance.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.960]   So just because it's our minimum risk asset
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   doesn't mean that we have to own them when they're
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.240]   trading at minus 1 or 2%.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   I want to just remind everyone, if you have a question,
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.800]   please do put it on a card.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.920]   And we will have people coming around to pick up your questions
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.720]   and curate them for us.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.280]   So Victor, I want to follow up on TIPS
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.680]   as a component of retiree portfolios
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   because you have said that for people who don't--
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.320]   if ideally you're spending in retirement, you write,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.920]   it should change proportionately as your portfolio grows
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.440]   or shrinks.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.280]   So you should take less when it's down.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.680]   You can take more when it's up.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.600]   But if you don't want to do that,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.680]   then you should go to TIPS as your main bulwark
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   for retirement spending.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.840]   Can you discuss that point?
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.360]   Sure, so that's what we were talking about earlier on,
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.760]   is this connection between spending policy and investment
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.800]   policy.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.200]   And so if you are just dead set that for the rest of your life
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.480]   you're going to just spend a certain amount adjusted
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.680]   for inflation or cost of living, and you're
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.320]   planning on exhausting your wealth
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.080]   by the end of your life-ish, then it
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.240]   doesn't make sense to own equities at all.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:09.160]   That now you're disconnecting your retirement savings
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.280]   with your spending plan.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   And that's how you can go bankrupt.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.680]   That's how you run out of money, is
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.760]   by having risk in your portfolio and then a fixed spending
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.040]   policy.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.760]   So you just have to adjust your spending.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.260]   And you don't want to wait until you're almost out of money.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.160]   You have to adjust your spending.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.040]   So if your portfolio value goes down,
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.600]   you're going to reduce your spending.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.960]   But if you're not willing to increase your spending
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.480]   if your portfolio goes up, then what
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.920]   was the point of taking that risk to begin with?
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.320]   If it's like, well, I'm just going to die with that money.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.840]   It's not going to any use whatsoever, then--
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.500]   now, if you have intergenerational transfers
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.160]   in mind, well, then things are different.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   And now your kids or so on are taking that residual risk.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.280]   And it may not be a fixed spending policy anymore.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.120]   But in that really simple case, a fixed spending policy--
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.440]   you shouldn't be taking any risk away from that, I think.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.240]   Some of the academic researchers in retirement planning
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.760]   would say an annuity would be a fit in that context
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.800]   for the person who wants--
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.440]   granted, you can't get a CPI-linked annuity.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.200]   But for someone who wants that stream of cash flow,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.080]   what do you think about a very simple annuity
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.640]   in that context?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.880]   I think that annuities make so much sense for so many people
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.280]   that one of the great puzzles in finance
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.760]   is why there's not so much more take-up of annuities.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   You're getting rid of a really big risk, longevity risk,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.760]   kind of for free or close to for free.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.960]   I mean, there's not a risk premium on this risk.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.520]   You're getting rid of longevity risk through risk sharing.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.120]   There's not necessarily a risk premium involved there.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:11.360]   Now, annuities, just straight annuities or deferred annuities
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.960]   that don't involve any equity risk,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.880]   the market prices them pretty reasonably altogether.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.840]   And if you're feeling pretty robust and healthy,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.800]   they can even be cheap, because the insurance companies don't
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   even ask, so how are you doing?
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.840]   They don't even ask if you're a smoker or whatever.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.280]   They just figure that, well, anybody that wants an annuity
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.840]   is in OK health.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:42.120]   And so they're reasonably priced.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.880]   There's more tax-efficient opportunities
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.400]   now to put them into our retirement accounts.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.200]   And there just seems like a tremendous undertake-up
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   of annuities for many, many people.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.360]   If you're very, very wealthy, an annuity may not make sense.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.440]   But if you're sort of thinking about, jeez,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.760]   I need to really preserve a lot of my wealth
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.040]   because I might make it into my 90s,
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.040]   well, then an annuity could be really good.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.000]   Now, it's weird.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Variable annuities, these annuities
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.120]   with caps and floors and equity, these things seem terrible.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.840]   And it's kind of interesting that you've
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.960]   got these terrible things sitting side
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.160]   by side with products, simple products that are really
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.720]   pretty useful and well-priced.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.600]   While we are queuing up to take some audience questions,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.040]   I wanted to ask about direct indexing,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.760]   building these custom baskets of individual stocks
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.200]   as a matter of taking tax losses regularly.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.680]   They seem to be getting sold to a lot of people.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.840]   I'd like your take on them, whether you think
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.680]   they're worth the complexity.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.280]   Sure.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.840]   So yeah, I mean, the direct indexing, tax-loss harvesting
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.080]   programs have really mushroomed recently.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.000]   Maybe there's $300 billion or more.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.560]   I think Morningstar said there was almost $300 billion
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.280]   of this a year or two ago already.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.860]   So maybe we're a lot bigger than that.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.280]   You know, it's Goldman, Morgan Stanley that
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.680]   bought Parametric, JPMorgan.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.480]   And the basic, the impetus for all of it
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.900]   is like, oh, I'm going to get all this tax-loss harvesting,
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.160]   because tax-loss harvesting, the amount of tax-loss harvesting
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.120]   you can get is proportional to how volatile the things are
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.200]   that you own.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.780]   So let's own individual equities,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.480]   because individual equities, on average,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   are twice as volatile as the indexes.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.640]   Now, that's true.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.240]   However, the tax-loss harvesting is subject to the wash/sale
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   rule, so whatever you sell, you can't buy it back for 31 days.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.560]   And so as a result, if you do one of these direct index
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.500]   programs with one of these providers,
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.760]   there's going to be a certain amount of tracking risk,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.200]   because you sell Apple, because maybe Apple goes down.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.760]   I don't know if it ever has gone down.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.060]   But if it went down, you could sell it.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.400]   But when you sell it, now you don't have Apple,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.020]   and you're going to buy something else.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.480]   So you have this tracking risk, and they're
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.200]   going to tell you, the provider of direct indexing
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.920]   is going to say, we're going to limit your tracking risk
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.640]   somewhat, because we don't want to have too much tracking risk.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.120]   Well, then you're not getting as much tax-loss harvesting
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.160]   as you could from those volatile equities.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.960]   And it turns out, from some analysis that we've done,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.020]   that you could get just about as much tax-loss harvesting
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.720]   from having a portfolio of ETFs, managing those,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.120]   or having them manage for tax-loss harvesting, which
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.040]   is a freebie for anybody that manages ETF portfolios.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.080]   They just throw in tax-loss harvesting for free,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.360]   rather than paying 50 basis points to Goldman or whatever.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.560]   And it's simpler.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.400]   And then three or four years down the road,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.000]   your portfolio is all appreciated.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.240]   And now you've got this weird portfolio of 400 stocks,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   not exactly matching the index.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.520]   You're still paying fees.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.960]   Your brokerage statement is like 20 pages long,
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.560]   and you're going to pull your hair out.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.600]   And it's like, what am I going to do now?
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.480]   Now I'm just locked into this thing forever.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.120]   So I think it's really being massively oversold and not
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.680]   a fan of the direct indexing at all.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.280]   And then now they say, oh, here's
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.000]   this other benefit of direct indexing.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.360]   We can customize for you.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.240]   And it's like, oh, you customize.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.040]   Well, we're index investors.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.280]   We don't want customization.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.360]   We want the market cap portfolio.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.840]   We don't want to just be like a long-sum portfolio, where
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.480]   a company-- where it doesn't have any companies from Texas
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.920]   in it or something like that.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.560]   So I think, yeah.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.480]   Here's a good question from the audience.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.800]   For simplicity, can someone allocate, say,
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.320]   15% of portfolio to a short-term tips fund at, say, Vanguard?
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.420]   And Vanguard has a good fund like that.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.160]   And call it a day versus buying individual tips and laddering,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.320]   like your take on that.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.680]   Yeah, I mean, I love using index funds and ETFs
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.520]   for everything and not buying any individual things.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.560]   I mean, there's a lot of discussion about, well,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.000]   is a tips ETF not as good as buying a ladder of tips?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.680]   And overall, I think they're--
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.040]   I don't feel there's such a big distinction there.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.800]   Like, if you're really trying to match out
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.680]   your spending for the rest of your life,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.780]   maybe you want to buy or construct a ladder.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.760]   But I think just owning these ETFs
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.200]   is such an unbelievably convenient way
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.040]   of owning fixed income.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.120]   I like using fixed income ETFs in general.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.440]   OK.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.680]   Here's a question about retirement decumulation.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.280]   When paying yourself once a year, what should I sell?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.520]   Stocks and funds that are up or just equally across the board?
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.020]   So if I'm pulling from my portfolio, where should I go?
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.880]   I think the starting point is equally across the board.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.320]   And then kind of just thinking about taxes.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.800]   Well, if you're going to be doing
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.520]   some kind of reallocation, you're
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.920]   going to use that as a way of changing your allocation.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.840]   But assuming that you have these target weights that you're
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.800]   shooting for, and you're there, and you're doing your
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:06.240]   rebalancing separately, then basically just using that--
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.400]   just taking a slice out of the portfolio
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.440]   is the simplest thing.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.960]   Maybe thinking about taxes a little bit might skew you.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.600]   But in general, I think just go for the portfolio
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.760]   that you want to have and do your stuff like that.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.720]   So is it an elegant idea, though,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.920]   to link my rebalancing with my retirement spending?
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.380]   I kind of like that idea of, if I've
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.480]   got to sell something to get my asset allocation back in line,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.640]   that's my cash flows?
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.760]   Yes.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.080]   I agree, very elegant.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.320]   Sort of separating the two, but putting them together
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.520]   is the way to do it.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   OK.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.160]   So what tools exist for passing wealth
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.080]   to a child that is not, and probably
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.720]   will not become, financially literate or savvy?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.360]   So children who you want to take care of where you feel
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.640]   like they don't have the ability to manage
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.360]   their funds going forward.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:09.640]   I mean, I would sort of challenge the premise there
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.240]   a little bit.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   I mean, I think investing is something is easy.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.520]   I think that-- so I don't know exactly what
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.200]   the scenario is for this child.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.640]   But I think that most people can learn really well
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.800]   about investing.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.760]   If that's just not possible with a particular person,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   then trying to really think about a trusted advisor
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.880]   and thinking about the incentives of the advisor,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.560]   the fees, maybe getting an advisor that's
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.680]   a fee-only advisor that charges a relatively low fee,
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.960]   to get that kind of advice.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.640]   I mean, I think finding a trusted advisor that's young
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.440]   and that the person can work with for a long time
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.400]   is the way to go.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.600]   How do you personally invest your money?
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.760]   You know, I have all of my family's liquid assets
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.880]   away from houses, whatever, are managed by Elm.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.800]   It's all in low-cost ETFs.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.400]   I don't own any individual stocks at all.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.000]   I just have been doing a lecture series
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.760]   on why I don't pick stocks.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.640]   And yeah, and that's really where my business of Elm Wealth
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   really came out of doing it for myself and then
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.360]   some friends saying, well, if you do it as a business,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.080]   we'd like to invest in that way, too.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   So sort of drawing more people into investing in low-cost ETFs.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   Yeah, I want to follow up on that, Victor, actually.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.320]   You have a minimum account size of $1 million
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.280]   for potential clients.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.120]   And I'm guessing a lot of people in this room
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.200]   would meet that threshold.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.040]   What made you decide to target that segment
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.240]   of the market versus the more rarefied people
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.880]   with a lot more in assets?
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.880]   Well, we would like to help people with as little money
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.640]   as possible, as many people with a lower limit.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.400]   But we needed to start somewhere.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.120]   And we really wanted to keep our fees really low.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.000]   So we charged 12 basis points.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.720]   And we felt that, well, actually even--
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.960]   and when we started the business,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.800]   trading was not commission-free yet.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.080]   So we needed certain account sizes back then
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.640]   to take care of the $5 per trade at Fidelity and Schwab
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.400]   and so on.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.080]   But actually, we'd like to be able to help smaller accounts.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.160]   And it's really sort of a technology race,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.480]   how we can manage lots and lots of accounts
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.560]   individually at a low cost.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.440]   I think that-- oh, more directly to your question,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.680]   really, really wealthy people are just
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.040]   totally unsensible, in my experience, with their money.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.960]   Like, you're just not going to find any--
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.920]   I mean, you're going to find almost no super wealthy person
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.840]   that's invested sensibly in a diversified portfolio of index
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.340]   funds.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.480]   It's like, I'm wealthy.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.200]   I'm entitled to extra returns by doing
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.440]   all of this weird, complex, crazy stuff.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:29.720]   So we don't want to spend a lot of time in that space.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:36.920]   So 12 basis points versus a 1% industry average
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.320]   for $1 million accounts.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   So I'm curious why you think it is
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.480]   that we have not seen more downward pressure on investment
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.560]   advisory fees.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.320]   So Vanguard, I think, charges around 30 basis points.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.200]   I mean, maybe it scales down.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.880]   And we know that Vanguard is doing it at break-even.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   So normal financial advisory is expensive.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.060]   There's not super high margins in the space.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.800]   And it really is just a function of what
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.640]   is that advisory looking like.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.800]   So I think when somebody is charging 50 basis points,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.920]   they're probably doing a lot of touch.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.680]   There's probably a lot of touch involved in that.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.600]   And again, Vanguard, they're charging 30
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.960]   because they're like, OK, this is what it looks like.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.160]   This is what our costs are.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.240]   Now, for us, we've tried to build our business
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.300]   in a way that's lower touch.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.560]   I mean, we're there, and we're there to talk to people.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.080]   But we're lower touch.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.240]   And the clientele requires less touch, our clientele.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.720]   We don't market, for instance.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.520]   So we're not selling our stuff.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.960]   People are coming to us, and there's an easier fit.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.680]   And so we're able to charge lower fees because we're
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.880]   doing less for people.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.040]   And then people know that.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.320]   They're like, well, if I'm paying you 12 basis points,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.800]   I don't expect that much from you.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.520]   And it's a really good signal.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.800]   And so I think there is a place for this really low-fee,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.440]   low-touch model.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.520]   So by low-touch, you mean if I were to call up Elm Wealth
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.040]   and say, I want some guidance on whether to pay off my house
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.960]   versus invest in the market, you can't put a CFP--
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.760]   or you wouldn't put a CFP on the line
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.320]   to help answer that question?
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.920]   Yeah, we would try to have a brief conversation about it.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.880]   But it wouldn't be as deep as a real financial planner.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.120]   A real financial planner would go deeper, deeper, deeper.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.800]   We can have a couple of conversations
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.840]   with each of our clients each year.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.920]   We probably don't have that many.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.720]   But that's right.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:50.200]   I mean, it's just a higher level, shallower take on things.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.120]   So I wanted to ask about long-term capital management,
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.840]   which was fairly early in your career.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.480]   I think most people will be aware of what happened there.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.200]   But you have written that that was a life-changing event
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.840]   for you, having worked on long-term capital.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.440]   And it really influenced the way that you
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.800]   think about the world, that you think about markets,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.600]   and your career, and everything else.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.520]   Can you summarize your key takeaways from that?
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.200]   We could do this whole session on that,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.760]   but from that experience?
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:30.640]   So in terms of my takeaways about how markets work,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.680]   and investing works, and so on, I
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.480]   think the most salient thing that I could say about--
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.320]   the most salient thing that comes to my mind
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.400]   is just, what a great reminder or illustration of how
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.640]   incredibly efficient markets are.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.600]   So we were finding all of these things--
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.320]   asset A versus asset B. They were almost the same,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.440]   but they were trading at a different price.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.840]   And we would buy the cheap one and sell the expensive one.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.720]   And you could see that those prices were not
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.840]   the right prices-- same cash flows, different prices.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.080]   This was like-- we didn't call it arbitrage,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.440]   but this is kind of the idea of arbitrage.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.800]   But the markets are so efficient that the amount
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.400]   of that disparity is so small--
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.280]   I mean, it's identifiable, but it's so small--
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.600]   that it doesn't really pay people to do it
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.720]   unless you use leverage.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.240]   Well, now as soon as you use leverage,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.640]   you're subject to the spreads widening out and needing
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.840]   to reduce and becoming riskier and more volatile.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:41.080]   And so what seems like a kind of a free lunch being offered
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:51.280]   by the market, in reality, is not a free lunch.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.240]   There's risk involved.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.280]   You're getting compensated for risk.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   And then it turns out that a lot of these things
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.800]   that kind of look like alpha have this tendency
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.440]   to lose a lot of money when the stock market is down huge.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.980]   And so you're doing these things that kind of look like they're
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.040]   alpha because in normal times, you're making money.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.080]   It's not correlated with the ups and downs of the stock market.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.520]   But you go into a really big financial crisis like 2008.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   Now, our thing was in 1998.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.000]   Thankfully, it was in '98.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.040]   It saved me 10 years.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.340]   Otherwise, I would've been working for another 10 years
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.740]   and hit 2008, and it would have been a disaster.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.580]   But in 2008, the financial crisis
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.080]   caused all of the banks and lending institutions
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.700]   to pull back balance sheet.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.180]   All of these relative value opportunities blew out,
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.020]   became riskier.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.160]   People had to reduce.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.820]   It was a disaster.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.900]   And so my LTCM experience, lots and lots
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.140]   of life-changing lessons.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.740]   But I think that it's just such a great reminder for me
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.540]   or illustration of how efficient markets are.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.580]   Last question.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.820]   I'm hoping you can answer really quickly, Victor,
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.740]   before we take a break.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.220]   You end your book with a quote from Milton Berle, which
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.020]   is that money can't buy you happiness,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.220]   but it helps you look for it in a lot more places.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:12.260]   Can you talk about how your perspective
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.100]   on money and happiness has changed
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.700]   since you started your career?
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.180]   Sure.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.620]   So when I started, I don't know, I
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.300]   was just so happy to have a job.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.020]   I was so grateful to have a job.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.740]   And I loved my job in Wall Street.
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.100]   I started off in research in 1984 at Salomon Brothers.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.020]   It was amazing.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.560]   And every day, I just couldn't believe
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.980]   that this was meant to be work.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.260]   It was so much fun.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.900]   And I just wasn't thinking about money.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.260]   But wow, the money was just out of control.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.580]   I mean, it was-- I don't know.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.700]   Every year, they were just paying me so much more
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.900]   than they should have or I thought I was worth or whatever.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.620]   And it went up and up and up.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:57.060]   And then I left Salomon and went and joined my partners
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.860]   to found this hedge fund, LTCM.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.900]   And then the money just kept going on up.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.820]   And it felt really good, but I wasn't really spending it
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.460]   on anything because I was really busy.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.900]   So it was like it was this counting thing.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.180]   So it was like, wow, it's nice to have a lot of money.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.700]   I wonder what I'll-- I just was so busy,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   I just wasn't thinking about it.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.980]   I don't know what I was thinking about.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.620]   I was just so strung out between kids and work and family
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.620]   and everything.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.220]   And then LTCM came, and boom.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.980]   I took a huge-- I don't know.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.540]   My family, we lost 80% of our wealth at that time.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.980]   And then I really paid attention.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.060]   And then I really thought about-- I
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.020]   started to really think about wealth and so on.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.420]   And that's when I started to really think
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.940]   about this idea that's just very basic in economics,
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.500]   that there is a decreasing marginal utility to more
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.180]   and more wealth.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.260]   The more wealth we have, each extra dollar
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.820]   is just worth less for us.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:05.260]   It's like how many-- with almost everything in life,
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.900]   there's a marginal decrease in the joy
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.580]   that we get from things as we get more and more of it.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.940]   And when I started to realize that,
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:19.620]   I realized that wealth has to be a means to an end.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.660]   It can't be an end in itself.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.180]   And it had me-- at that time, I really re-evaluated my life.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:29.460]   I took a 10-year sabbatical to reboot, re-educate,
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.620]   where I wasn't working.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.620]   My kids were young.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.540]   I was an at-home dad for 10 years
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.860]   before I started Elm Wealth.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.140]   And so LTCM was like a shock therapy for me
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.820]   that got me, hopefully, to look at things
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.540]   in a more holistic manner.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.620]   Well, Victor, we are so grateful to you for being here today.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.020]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.860]   Thank you, Christine.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.780]   Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:44:02.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
