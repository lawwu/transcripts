[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   - Right now, I am so excited to welcome
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.460]   Victor Hagani to the stage.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.200]   Victor is the co-author of a book
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.840]   called The Missing Billionaires,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.640]   A Guide to Better Financial Decisions.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   We had Victor on our Morningstar podcast earlier this year
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.440]   and had such a great conversation with him.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.320]   He founded Elm Wealth, which is a very low-fee
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.240]   investment advisory firm for high-net-worth individuals.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.920]   He started his career at Salomon Brothers in 1984,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800]   where he became a managing director
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.480]   in the Bond Arbitrage Group.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.120]   And in 1993, he was a co-founding partner
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.680]   of Long-Term Capital Management,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.200]   and we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.760]   He graduated from the London School of Economics
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180]   with a bachelor's degree in economics.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.040]   Victor, if you can come on up here,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.300]   and please welcome Victor.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300]   (audience applauds)
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.600]   So just pick up a mic of your choice.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.120]   Maybe I'll sit here.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.200]   - Hello?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   Turn it on, right?
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   Okay. (laughs)
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   - Victor, thank you for being here.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.080]   - Thank you so much, Christine.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.120]   - So let's talk about your book, The Missing Billionaires.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.080]   You did a calculation that there should be
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   about 16,000 old-money billionaires alive today,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.320]   but there are virtually none on the Forbes 2022 list
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560]   of 700 U.S. billionaires.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.400]   So can you talk about what went wrong
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.820]   for these individuals so that they did not
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.460]   hang on to their fortunes?
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.300]   - Sure.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.480]   So we start off the book by talking about this example
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   of there were so many, you know,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   quite a few wealthy families 125 years ago in 1900,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.400]   and if they had just invested and matched the return
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   of this U.S. stock market and paid taxes
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   and spent some of their money in a reasonable way,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200]   and had children at a reasonable sort of normal pace,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   there would be all these billionaire families today
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.140]   from those early families, but they're not.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.800]   And we don't know exactly what went wrong
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   or what went right from a societal point of view
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.160]   to not have so many of these billionaires,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   but you know, our feeling is that the mistakes
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.120]   that people made, the financial mistakes
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   that people made were mostly around risk and spending,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.100]   and that they took more risk in their investments
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.360]   and didn't match their family spending policies
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000]   with the risk in their portfolio.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   So a lot of concentrated portfolios,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400]   a lot of these wealthy families made their money
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   in some particular business like the Vanderbilts
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.840]   and transportation, and you know, by 1950,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.120]   the Vanderbilts still were mostly invested
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   in railroads and transportation,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   which didn't go too well for them.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.840]   And we have this little toy example
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.160]   that we like to talk about that really illustrates,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.200]   you know, how this mismatch between spending risk
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.240]   and investment risk can really go wrong
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   and how risk eats into compound returns.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.300]   In our example, you know, it's very simplified,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.240]   but, and it's only got two numbers in it.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.880]   Imagine that you build an investment portfolio
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840]   where you feel that the expected return
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.560]   of your portfolio is 5% above inflation per annum,
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.240]   that's the average annual return,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.200]   not the compound return, but the average annual return.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   And then you decide, okay, you know,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.360]   let's say I have, you know, a million dollars,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   I'm gonna spend 4% of that for the rest of my life,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   but 4% adjusted for inflation from that starting point.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.820]   And you're like, well, that doesn't sound too bad.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.260]   I mean, my expected return is 5%,
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.240]   so I should be able to spend, you know,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.420]   this 4% number to begin with,
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.000]   $40,000 for the rest of my life adjusted for inflation.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.700]   And, but let's say that that portfolio
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   is a really risky one because you picked a, you know,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.020]   a set of, a small set of stocks that you really like,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.420]   but it's risky, maybe it goes up and down by 30% a year,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.700]   twice as risky as the stock market.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120]   Well, now the question is, after 25 years,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   what's the most likely amount of wealth that you will have?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.760]   And the answer to that is zero.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.460]   You're expected to go bankrupt.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.860]   You will not make it 25 years on, you know,
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.080]   more than, in more than 50% of the cases you're bankrupt
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   because the volatility, that 30% volatility
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.800]   is just killing your compound return.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.480]   And you just keep on spending that $40,000 each year.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   So, you know, we think that that's a really big explanation
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.040]   for what happened over time to many of these wealthy,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.440]   dynastically wealthy families.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.280]   - So let's talk about the key lessons
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   that Boglehead should take away from that history lesson.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.920]   What lessons should we internalize as investors?
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.240]   And also, what are the key mistakes that we avoid,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.080]   should avoid?
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.400]   You mentioned excessive risk-taking, profligate spending,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.280]   I'm sure factored into many of these losses over time,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.440]   but maybe talk about those things.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   - Yeah, well, I think that we, Bogleheads,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.600]   I'm really glad to count myself in there,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.840]   that we're avoiding, you know,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.600]   as part of our central thinking,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.040]   we're avoiding most of the big mistakes.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   So, you know, being really thoughtful about risk
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.440]   by being sort of maximally diversified,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.000]   being really conscious of costs,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.360]   the cost matters hypothesis, really important.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.300]   So those are the, you know,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.680]   those are the things that we all know about.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.640]   I think some of the extra things that are really important
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.320]   are around thinking about spending,
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.880]   where I think that we need to have spending policies
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.440]   as individuals and families
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.180]   that are connected to our investment policy.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.560]   So I don't think that we can have 70% of our money
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.460]   in equities and then have a spending policy
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.440]   where we're trying to spend a fixed amount of money
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.840]   adjusted for inflation each year,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.780]   that our spending policy is inexorably linked
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.480]   to the risk that we're taking in our portfolios.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   And, you know, this isn't any kind of original thinking,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.280]   you know, it's something that's been, you know,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.880]   in the literature since the late 1960s.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.920]   - Yeah, I wanna follow up
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.020]   on some of what you just talked about, Victor,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.480]   but while we are still on these individuals
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.280]   and their families who lost their fortunes,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   I think a real life question that a lot of individuals
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   in this room grapple with, they have children,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   they have grandchildren perhaps,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   and they want to try to pass wealth to them
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.880]   the question is how to do that without spoiling the kids,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.000]   how do they inculcate their kids
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   in being sensible about money?
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.880]   - Sure, so I think as is often the case,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.280]   Warren Buffet, you know, has a really pithy statement
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.920]   about it where he says, you know,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.560]   I wanna leave my kids or give my kids enough money
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.360]   so they can do anything, but not enough,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.000]   but not so much that they can do nothing.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.840]   I don't think he actually followed that advice,
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   but okay, but I think that's a, you know,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.160]   a good way of thinking about it,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.560]   and, you know, I mean, I'm a parent,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.320]   I have three kids, 30, 28, 25,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.360]   and, you know, my wife and I, you know,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.340]   our number one priority in our lives
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.880]   has been devoting ourselves
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.760]   to the upbringing of these children,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.200]   and I think that it's really kind of,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.040]   would be weird if somehow we just decided
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.960]   to stop helping them or wanting to help them,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.400]   you know, once they become 18 or 22 or whatever,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.280]   so I think it's natural to wanna help your kids
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   through life, but, you know, I think that, you know,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.520]   definitely too much financial help, you know,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.280]   can really be destructive.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.320]   Now, luckily, you know, I think that,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.160]   you know, if, you know, luckily in some ways
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.520]   that, you know, passing wealth to our kids
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.040]   is really expensive between, you know, taxes
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.640]   and, you know, the fact that the, you know,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.320]   rate of return on safe and risky assets
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.040]   is not that high these days, so, you know,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.560]   like if you wanna try to help your kids
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.120]   and maybe grandkids, you know, to the tune of,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.060]   say, $50,000 a year of help in some ways after tax,
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.680]   like that takes a tremendous amount of wealth
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.200]   to support that, so anyway,
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.000]   but I think that, you know, good question,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.960]   I think that, yeah, I think, you know, as I say,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.760]   I think that one statement by Mr. Buffett
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.440]   is pretty good in terms of how I and my wife
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.640]   like to think about it.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.560]   - That's helpful.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.200]   So I want to switch over to portfolios and planning
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.440]   because you were involved in that in your day job
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.760]   in managing people's portfolios.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.200]   Most Bogleheads, I would say, use a strategic buy,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.180]   hold, and rebalance approach to their portfolios.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.080]   They keep things pretty simple,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.720]   yet at your firm, Elm Wealth,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   you do use a dynamic asset allocation strategy.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.760]   Can you talk about that, how you decide
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.720]   whether to make changes in client portfolios?
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.280]   - Yeah, I think that's a, you know,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.840]   it's a really interesting question.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.980]   Actually, we, when we started Elm Wealth,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.120]   we applied to the patent office
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   for the term dynamic index investing
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.600]   to get a trademark for that,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.440]   and we heard back from the patent office,
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.320]   and they said, we're gonna give you that,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.000]   we're gonna give you that trademark
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.500]   because it just doesn't make sense.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.360]   You know, index investing is passive.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.040]   You know, it's a, it's sort of a,
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.800]   it sounds like an oxymoron to us
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.660]   here at the U.S. Patent Office.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.040]   Isn't index investing meant to be passive and not dynamic?
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.560]   So in order to make investment decisions,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.480]   we need to know the expected return
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.400]   of the different things that we're investing in
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.880]   and the risk of them.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.800]   And we also need to have an idea
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.040]   of our own personal degree of risk aversion.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.280]   So that's really the only way that I can think of
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.480]   of making portfolio decisions.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.840]   You know, what's the expected return
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.800]   of the different things we can invest in,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   their risk, and our personal risk aversion.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.420]   So we need those things.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.680]   Now, if the expected return and risk
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.480]   of the different things that we're investing in
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.040]   never change, then you would have a,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.120]   you would decide what those numbers are
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.400]   and your risk aversion, I'm gonna assume, is stable.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.600]   Then you would say, okay,
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.520]   the expected returns are constant.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.220]   The risk is constant.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.280]   I'm just gonna figure out the optimal
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.600]   portfolio allocations for me.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.760]   I'm done, and that's it.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.960]   And then they stay the same forever
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.120]   because the expected return is staying
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.720]   the same and the risk.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.520]   But nobody believes that.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.080]   You know, I don't understand, you know,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.480]   that nobody believes that the expected returns
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.280]   of all the different things are constant through time.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.120]   For one thing, we see interest rates
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.520]   changing every single day.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.840]   Real interest rates on tips go up and down,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   up and down.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   I mean, how can, you know, we know
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.280]   that the expected returns are changing.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.840]   We also know that risk is changing.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.720]   Like in, that the stock market in early 2020
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   was wildly risky.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   And at other times, like right now,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.440]   it's not very risky at all.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.960]   It's not bouncing around a lot.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.840]   You know, it's in a more sedate mode.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   So we know that the risk is changing.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.000]   And we also have a view about
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.560]   the expected return of equities,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.040]   and the expected return of equities
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.640]   is also changing over time.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.840]   And it is possible to observe it and to estimate it.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.800]   We'll talk about that, I think, in a moment.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.560]   But you could go to Vanguard's website,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.440]   and they have a page called Capital Market Assumptions.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.920]   And right there, you just go there,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.680]   and it says expected return U.S. equities
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.760]   for the next 10 or 30 years is, you know, whatever, 6%.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.800]   Expected return of non-U.S. equities
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.760]   for the next 10 or 30 years, you choose,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.360]   you know, is whatever, 8%.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.000]   Expected return of bonds, 4%.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.800]   And those numbers are changing every six months.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.560]   So why shouldn't they be part
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.360]   of our asset allocation decision?
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.640]   Now, it might be that people say,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   you know, I just don't have time for that.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.040]   And I think that's reasonable.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.600]   You know, that's a reasonable response
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.720]   to say I don't have time for that.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.840]   I'm just gonna go with something static.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.160]   Maybe I'll revisit it every five or 10 years.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.400]   But I think that from a logical point of view
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.560]   that you have to, you know, that it makes sense
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.160]   that it should change if you're willing
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.840]   to spend the time chasing down
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.600]   these expected returns and risks.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.320]   - So just a quick follow-up on that.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   If I don't wanna spend a lot of time
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.280]   monkeying with my portfolio,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.960]   would just a simple annual rebalancing
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.480]   address some of the things that you're talking about
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.800]   where I'm periodically stripping back
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.520]   what has performed really well
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.840]   and adding to the things that haven't performed as well?
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.880]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.760]   I think that, you know, there's a spectrum
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   of things that we can do with our wealth.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.280]   And, you know, like what most people are,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.840]   not in this room, but what most people
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.280]   in the world are doing is over here,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.640]   and it's not very good.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.400]   And then, you know, over here would be
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.280]   like a static asset allocation,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.160]   maybe, you know, thinking things over once a year
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.320]   or even once every five year.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.480]   That's over here.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.800]   And then what I'm saying,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.400]   I don't know if you remember where that hand was,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.640]   and I'm saying that like maybe over here
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.080]   is the best that you could do if you really feel like it,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.640]   but it's so close.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.080]   You know, we're really close in here.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.000]   I mean, the main thing is, you know, be diversified,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.200]   keep the costs down, keep the taxes down,
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.480]   spend appropriately, you know,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.720]   and then you're all the way over here.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.520]   Now, whether you go here or not, you know,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.160]   that's, I don't think that's where the juice is.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.240]   You know, it's getting from over here
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.400]   with all this crazy stuff and getting over here.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.280]   - Okay, so stay away from over here.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah, okay.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.440]   (laughing)
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.360]   So I wanted to ask, you alluded to the fact
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.680]   that you think about where the long-term real return
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.920]   of the US market is, and to arrive at that,
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.560]   you use cyclically adjusted earnings yield.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.960]   I'm wondering if you can talk about A, what that is,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.200]   and B, where that puts us today
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.120]   in terms of the broad market.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   - So cyclically adjusted earnings yield is,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.960]   well, it's an idea that goes all the way back
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.240]   to Benjamin Graham's 1940s book,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.080]   but it was really repopularized by Bob Shiller
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   and John Campbell in the late '80s,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   you know, just saying that, look,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.280]   if you're buying equities, you know,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.960]   it's like buying an apartment building
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.520]   or a commercial building, you know,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.240]   you're looking at your income and dividing it
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.800]   by the price that you pay, that's your earnings yield
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.960]   or your rental yield, and that's, you know,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.280]   that's as good of a long-term predictor
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.920]   of the real return on that investment
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.400]   that we can come up with, at least in terms
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   of a simple and decent expected return estimator.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.520]   It's like, okay, I'm putting money into the stock market,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.880]   you know, if companies paid out all their earnings
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.400]   as dividends each year, which they don't,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.200]   but if they did, then the belief is that companies
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   in aggregate would be able to keep the earnings constant
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.920]   in real terms, and that gives us this tie-in
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.840]   between earnings yield and the long-term expected
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.160]   real return of the stock market.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.640]   Today, the cyclically adjusted earnings yield,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.000]   which is basically just looking at the last 10 years
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.160]   of earnings adjusted for inflation,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.280]   we could also adjust it for payout ratios
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.720]   to get a slightly better estimate,
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.280]   but not a big difference.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   So right now, for U.S. equities, broad U.S. equities,
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.080]   the cyclically adjusted earnings yield
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.560]   is around 3 1/2%, and of course,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   tips are around, tips are just under 2%,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.840]   so the expected excess return of U.S. equities
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.040]   relative to the safe asset of tips is about 1 1/2%,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.600]   not very high, not very exciting.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.680]   For non-U.S. equities, that spread between tips
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.760]   and the earnings yield is closer to 5%,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.840]   and actually, Vanguard, on Vanguard's website,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.360]   and everybody, all the big investment firms
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.120]   have a capital markets assumption page.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.280]   You could go to BlackRock's, Goldman Sachs, whatever,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.640]   but we love Vanguard, and Vanguard's numbers
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.560]   kind of are pretty similar to what you would get
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.480]   from earnings yield.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.720]   They do a much more complicated analysis,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.600]   much more opaque, maybe better,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.480]   but the numbers come out almost the same
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.360]   as just using cyclically adjusted earnings yield.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.960]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.760]   You alluded to this gulf between U.S., non-U.S.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.640]   It's been kind of persistent where most firms
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.880]   do believe that the return expectations
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   for non-U.S. look better over the next decade than U.S.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.800]   So what kind of international allocation
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.960]   do you think makes sense for the average investor?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.040]   And I'm wondering, is the global market capitalization
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.440]   like using a Vanguard total world stock index,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.400]   is that a good way to think about it?
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.120]   Or if not using the fund, at least using it
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.360]   to set my U.S., non-U.S. allocation,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.200]   or how should people approach it?
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.000]   - I think that's a really good starting point.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.080]   Yeah, I think using these,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.840]   they're adjusted market caps, actually,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.200]   because FTSE and MSCI really haircut the market cap
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.920]   of a lot of non-U.S. markets for investability
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.800]   and values and so on.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   So yeah, I think market cap weight isn't too bad.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.040]   You know, that's around 60/40 right now,
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.520]   60% U.S., 40% non-U.S.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.320]   You know, there's lots of arguments out there.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.600]   I heard Rick yesterday talking about U.S. versus non-U.S.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   You know, there's all kinds of arguments you can make
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.320]   about what's better or not.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.520]   Some of the arguments, one in particular
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.720]   of the many different ones that I think is interesting
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.520]   is probably like 20 or 30 years ago,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   both Mr. Bogle and Warren Buffett said to U.S. investors,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.640]   don't worry about the rest of the world, who cares?
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   Just invest in U.S. stocks.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.240]   After all, the S&P 500 gets 30, 40% of its revenue
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.600]   and profits from outside of the U.S., it's international.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.000]   And that was a good point,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.760]   but things are so different today in the sense that,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.200]   you know, now, if you own the S&P 500,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.880]   that 40% of earnings is coming from the rest of the world,
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.280]   you're paying a U.S. multiple for that.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.320]   And for non-U.S. companies,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   they're making 30% of their money in the U.S.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.840]   and you get to buy that earnings stream
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.640]   at the non-U.S. multiple, which is much lower.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.600]   So, you know, the arguments of Buffett and Bogle
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.760]   from 20, 30 years ago are actually now arguments
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.440]   against investing in the S&P 500
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.200]   to get your international exposure.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.960]   - You referenced TIPS,
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.040]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, earlier,
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.240]   and you think that they should be
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.040]   investors' minimum risk asset in lieu of cash
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.280]   and other cash-like investments.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.640]   Can you discuss the thesis there
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.000]   and also kind of the practical implications,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.600]   if I were to do that?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.360]   What we've seen in periods of equity market volatility
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.440]   is that TIPS have been more volatile, certainly.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.920]   I mean, they have risk and cash does not.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.160]   So maybe just follow up on that.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.800]   - So I think we should measure our wealth
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.080]   not as the present value of our wealth,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.920]   but as the long-term real consumption
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.320]   that our wealth can support.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   And, you know, going back 150 years or so,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.400]   that's how people used to talk about
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.000]   how wealthy somebody was.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.680]   You know, like in Jane Eyre or whatever,
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.520]   they would say, oh, that Mr. Darcy,
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.000]   you know, he's worth 10,000 a year.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.400]   They didn't say he's, you know,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.480]   he's worth whatever, 200,000 of present value
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.840]   in his brokerage account.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.440]   He was worth, you know, 10,000 a year or whatever.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.560]   And I think that's the sensible way.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.160]   I mean, we're not counting our wealth
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   in our brokerage account is not a valid use of our wealth.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.640]   It's just spending it, you know,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.440]   or giving it away over time.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.080]   So if the real measure of our wealth
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.800]   is the long-term spending power that it can generate,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.600]   then it's kind of clear why something like TIPS
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.800]   is gonna be the minimum risk asset.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.760]   Now, just because it's the minimum risk asset
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.800]   doesn't mean that you need to own any of it.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   So when TIPS were trading at minus 1.5% real yield,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.920]   you know, where you were locking in a minus 1.5%
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.400]   or you were locking in a loss of purchasing power
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.440]   of 1.5% per year, you might have said,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.880]   okay, it's my minimum risk asset,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.600]   but I don't wanna own any of it because it stinks.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.560]   And so, you know, I think that there's that,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.680]   it still is reasonable to say that's my minimum risk asset,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.560]   but I'm gonna take some more risk
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.640]   and own treasury bills, right?
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.760]   So now treasury bills are riskier than TIPS
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.280]   'cause TIPS is the minimum risk asset,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.120]   but it's like, okay, you know what?
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.840]   I'm gonna own treasury bills
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.480]   because I think that treasury bills
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.600]   are gonna do a lot better than TIPS, for instance.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.000]   So just because it's our minimum risk asset
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   doesn't mean that we have to own them
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.200]   when they're trading at minus 1% or 2%.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.080]   - I want to just remind everyone,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.760]   if you have a question, please do put it on a card
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.000]   and we will have people coming around
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.640]   to pick up your questions and curate them for us.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.200]   So, Victor, I want to follow up on TIPS
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.640]   as a component of retiree portfolios
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.840]   because you have said that for people who don't,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.400]   if ideally you're spending in retirement,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.320]   you write it should change proportionately
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.360]   as your portfolio grows or shrinks.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.200]   So you should take less when it's down,
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.640]   you can take more when it's up.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.520]   But if you don't want to do that,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.640]   then you should go to TIPS as kind of your main bulwark
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.000]   for retirement spending.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.800]   Can you discuss that point?
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.280]   - Sure, so that's what we were talking about earlier on
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.840]   is this connection between spending policy
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.720]   and investment policy.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.360]   And so if you are just dead set
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.320]   that for the rest of your life,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.920]   you're gonna just spend a certain amount
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.520]   adjusted for inflation or cost of living,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.280]   then, and you're planning on exhausting your wealth
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.960]   by the end of your life-ish,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.200]   then it doesn't make sense to own equities at all.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   That now you're disconnecting your retirement savings
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   with your spending plan.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   And that's how you can go bankrupt.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.480]   That's how you run out of money
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.080]   is by having risk in your portfolio
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.120]   and then a fixed spending policy.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.080]   So you just have to adjust your spending
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.200]   and you don't want to wait until you're almost out of money.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.120]   You have to adjust your spending.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.080]   So if your portfolio value goes down,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.480]   you're gonna reduce your spending.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.000]   But if you're not willing to increase your spending,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.840]   if your portfolio goes up,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.960]   then what was the point of taking that risk to begin with?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.360]   If it's like, well, I'm just gonna die with that money,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.000]   it's not going to any use whatsoever,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   then, now, if you have intergenerational transfers in mind,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.040]   well, then, things are different.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:04.160]   And now your kids or so on are taking that residual risk
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.280]   and it may not be a fixed spending policy anymore.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.120]   But in that really simple case, a fixed spending policy,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.480]   you just shouldn't be taking any risk away from that,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.440]   I think.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.280]   - Some of the academic researchers in retirement planning
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.800]   would say an annuity would be a fit in that context
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.840]   for the person who wants,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.480]   granted, you can't get a CPI-linked annuity,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.280]   but for someone who wants that stream of cash flow,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.120]   what do you think about a very simple annuity
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.560]   in that context?
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.240]   - Yeah, I think that annuities make so much sense
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.280]   for so many people that one of the great puzzles in finance
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.680]   is why there's not so much more take-up of annuities.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.280]   You're getting rid of a really big risk, longevity risk,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.720]   kind of for free, or close to for free.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.920]   I mean, there's not a risk premium on this risk.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.480]   You're getting rid of longevity risk through risk sharing.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.080]   There's not necessarily a risk premium involved there.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   Now, annuities, just straight annuities or deferred annuities
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.000]   that don't involve any equity risk,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.880]   the market prices them pretty reasonably altogether.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.840]   And if you're feeling pretty robust and healthy,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.600]   they can even be cheap because the insurance companies
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.340]   don't even ask, "So, how are you doing?"
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.840]   They don't even ask if you're a smoker or whatever.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.920]   They just figure that, well, anybody that wants an annuity
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.040]   is in okay health.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.760]   But yeah, I think, and so they're kind of reasonably,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.240]   they're reasonably priced.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.080]   There's more tax-efficient opportunities now
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.120]   to put them into our retirement accounts.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.200]   And there's just, seems like a tremendous undertake-up
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.300]   of annuities for many, many people.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.040]   If you're very, very wealthy,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.360]   an annuity may not make sense.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.760]   But if you're sort of thinking about,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.680]   "Geez, I need to really preserve a lot of my wealth
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.020]   "because I might make it into my 90s,"
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.000]   well, then an annuity could be really good.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.120]   Now, it's weird, variable annuities,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.160]   these annuities with caps and floors and equity,
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.080]   these things seem terrible.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.200]   And it's kind of interesting
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.240]   that you've got these terrible things
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.720]   sitting side-by-side with products,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.480]   simple products that are really pretty useful
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.860]   and well-priced.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.600]   - While we are queuing up to take some audience questions,
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.040]   I wanted to ask about direct indexing,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.760]   building these custom baskets of individual stocks
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.160]   as a matter of taking tax losses regularly.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.640]   They seem to be getting sold to a lot of people.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.200]   I'd like your take on them,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.680]   whether you think they're worth the complexity.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.240]   - Sure, so yeah, I mean, the direct indexing,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.600]   tax-loss-harvesting programs have really
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.960]   mushroomed recently, maybe there's 300 billion or more.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.520]   I think Morningstar said there was almost 300 billion
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.400]   of this a year or two ago already,
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.000]   so maybe we're a lot bigger than that.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.360]   It's Goldman, Morgan Stanley that bought Parametric,
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.040]   JP Morgan, and the basic,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.160]   the impetus for all of it is like,
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.880]   oh, I'm gonna get all this tax-loss-harvesting
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.760]   because tax-loss-harvesting,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.680]   the amount of tax-loss-harvesting you can get
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.480]   is proportional to how volatile
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.160]   the things are that you own.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.760]   So let's own individual equities
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   'cause individual equities on average
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.160]   are twice as volatile as the indexes.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.480]   Now, that's true.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.800]   However, the tax-loss-harvesting
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.520]   is subject to the wash-sale rule,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.040]   so whatever you sell, you can't buy it back for 31 days.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.000]   And so as a result,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.080]   if you do one of these direct index programs
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   with one of these providers,
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.640]   there's gonna be a certain amount of tracking risk
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.480]   'cause you sell Apple, 'cause maybe Apple goes down,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.720]   I don't know if it ever has gone down,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.080]   but if it went down, you could sell it.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.360]   But when you sell it, now you don't have Apple
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.400]   and you're gonna buy something else,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.840]   so you have this tracking risk,
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.320]   and they're gonna tell you,
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.400]   the provider of direct indexing is gonna say,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.280]   "We're gonna limit your tracking risk somewhat
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.680]   "'cause we don't wanna have too much tracking risk."
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.040]   Well, then you're not getting as much tax-loss-harvesting
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   as you could from those volatile equities.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.880]   And it turns out from some analysis that we've done
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.920]   that you could get just about as much tax-loss-harvesting
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.760]   from having a portfolio of ETFs,
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.560]   managing those or having them managed
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.760]   for tax-loss-harvesting, which is a freebie
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.040]   for anybody that manages ETF portfolios.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.080]   They just throw in tax-loss-harvesting for free
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.320]   rather than paying 50 basis points to Goldman or whatever.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.360]   And it's simpler, and then three or four years down the road,
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.960]   your portfolio's all appreciated,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.200]   and now you got this weird portfolio of 400 stocks
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.960]   not exactly matching the index.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.480]   You're still paying fees.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.920]   Your brokerage statement is like 20 pages long,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.440]   and you're gonna pull your hair out.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.800]   And it's like, what am I gonna do now?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.480]   Now I'm just locked into this thing forever.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.880]   So I think it's really being massively oversold
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.680]   and not a fan of the direct indexing at all.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.000]   And then now they say, oh, here's this other benefit
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   of direct indexing.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.360]   We can customize for you.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.240]   And it's like, oh, you customize.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.000]   Well, we're index investors.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.240]   We don't want customization.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.320]   We want the market cap portfolio.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.600]   We don't wanna just be like a long-sum portfolio
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   where it doesn't have any companies from Texas in it
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.880]   or something like that.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.480]   So I think, yeah.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.440]   - Here's a good question from the audience.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.680]   For simplicity, can someone allocate, say, 15% of portfolio
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.320]   to a short-term tips fund at, say, Vanguard,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.200]   and Vanguard has a good fund like that,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.880]   and call it a day versus buying individual tips
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.280]   and laddering, like your take on that?
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I love using index funds and ETFs
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   for everything and not buying any individual things.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.960]   I mean, there's a lot of discussion about,
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.400]   well, is a tips ETF, well, not as good
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.000]   as buying a ladder of tips.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.920]   And overall, I don't feel there's such a big distinction.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.520]   They're like, if you're really trying to match out
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.600]   your spending for the rest of your life,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.760]   maybe you wanna buy or construct a ladder.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.720]   But I think just owning these ETFs
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.120]   is such a unbelievably convenient way
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.000]   of owning fixed income.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   I like using fixed income ETFs in general.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.680]   - Okay, here's a question about retirement decumulation.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.280]   When paying yourself once a year, what should I sell?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.520]   Stocks and funds that are up
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.440]   or just equally across the board?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.200]   So if I'm pulling from my portfolio, where should I go?
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.920]   - I think the starting point is equally across the board,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.360]   and then kind of just thinking about taxes.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.440]   Well, if you're gonna be doing some kind of reallocation,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.920]   you're gonna use that as a way of changing your allocation,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.480]   but assuming that you have these target weights
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.280]   that you're shooting for, and you're there,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.440]   and you're doing your rebalancing separately,
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.280]   then basically just using that,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.440]   just taking a slice out of the portfolio
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.480]   is the simplest thing.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.000]   Maybe thinking about taxes a little bit might skew you,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.640]   but in general, I think just go for the portfolio
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.660]   that you want to have and do your stuff like that.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.760]   - So is it an elegant idea, though,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.720]   to link my rebalancing with my retirement spending?
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.520]   I kind of like that idea of if I've gotta sell something
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.480]   to get my asset allocation back in line,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.680]   that's my cash flows?
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.240]   - Yes, yeah, I agree, very elegant,
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.280]   sort of separating the two,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.520]   but putting them together is the way to do it.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.360]   - So what tools exist for passing wealth to a child
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.880]   that is not and probably will not become
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.740]   financially literate or savvy?
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.840]   So children who you want to take care of
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.920]   where you feel like they don't have the ability
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.540]   to manage their funds going forward.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:08.560]   - I mean, you know, I would sort of challenge
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.240]   the premise there a little bit.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.320]   I mean, I think investing is, you know,
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.960]   is something, is easy.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.480]   You know, I think that, so, you know,
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.160]   I don't know exactly, you know,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.240]   what the scenario is for this child,
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.880]   but I think that most people, you know,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.600]   can learn really well about investing.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.960]   You know, if that's just not possible
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.800]   with a particular person, you know,
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.160]   then trying to really think about a trusted advisor,
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.080]   you know, and thinking about the incentives
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.860]   of the advisor, the fees, you know,
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.200]   maybe getting an advisor that's a fee-only advisor
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.700]   that charges a relatively low fee, you know,
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.960]   to get that kind of advice.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   I mean, I think, you know, finding a trusted advisor
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.640]   that's young and that the person can work with
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.520]   for a long time is the way to go.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   - How do you personally invest your money?
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.760]   - You know, I have all of my family's liquid assets
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.900]   away from houses, whatever, are managed by Elm.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.260]   It's all in low-cost ETFs.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.520]   I don't own any individual stocks at all.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.020]   I just have been doing a lecture series
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.880]   on why I don't pick stocks.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.400]   And yeah, so, and that's really where this,
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.880]   my business of Elm Wealth really came out of
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.160]   doing it for myself and then some friends saying,
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.360]   well, if you do it, if you do it as a business,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.080]   we'd like to invest in that way too.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.360]   So sort of drawing more people into investing
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.640]   in low-cost ETFs.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   - Yeah, I wanna follow up on that, Victor, actually.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.320]   You have a minimum account size of a million dollars
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.680]   for potential clients, and I'm guessing a lot of people
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.160]   in this room would meet that threshold.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.760]   What made you decide to target that segment of the market
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   versus the more rarefied people with a lot more in assets?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:11.440]   - Well, we wanted to, we would like to help people
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.400]   with as little money as possible,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.640]   as many people with a lower limit,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.400]   but we needed to start somewhere
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.080]   and we really wanted to keep our fees really low.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.640]   So we charged 12 basis points and we felt that,
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.000]   well, actually even, and when we started the business,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.800]   trading was not commission-free yet.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.120]   So we needed certain account sizes back then
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.960]   to take care of the $5 per trade
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.420]   at Fidelity and Schwab and so on.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.920]   But actually, we would like to be able to help
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:48.840]   smaller accounts, and it's really sort of a technology race,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.240]   how we can manage lots and lots of accounts individually
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   at a low cost.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.480]   I think that, oh, more directly to your question,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.040]   really, really wealthy people are just totally unsensible
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.080]   in my experience with their money.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.000]   Like, you're just not gonna find any,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.960]   I mean, you're gonna find almost no super wealthy person
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.420]   that's invested sensibly in a diversified portfolio
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.260]   of index funds.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.760]   It's like, I'm wealthy, I'm entitled to extra returns
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.440]   by doing all of this weird, complex, crazy stuff.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.540]   So we don't have,
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.720]   we don't wanna spend a lot of time in that space.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.480]   - So 12 basis points
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   versus a 1% industry average for $1 million accounts.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.320]   So I'm curious why you think it is
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.520]   that we have not seen more downward pressure
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.560]   on investment advisory fees?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.340]   - So Vanguard, I think, charges around 30 basis points.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.160]   I mean, maybe it scales down.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   And we know that Vanguard is doing it at breakeven.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.780]   So normal financial advisory is expensive.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.060]   There's not super high margins in the space.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.420]   And it really is just a function
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.660]   of what is that advisory looking like?
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.780]   So I think when somebody's charging 50 basis points,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.900]   they're probably doing a lot of touch.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.660]   There's probably a lot of touch involved in that.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.620]   And again, Vanguard, they're charging 30
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.960]   'cause they're like, okay, this is what it looks like.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.140]   This is what our costs are.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.220]   Now for us, we've tried to build our business
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.280]   in a way that's lower touch.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.540]   I mean, we're there and we're there to talk to people,
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.060]   but we're lower touch.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   And the clientele requires less touch, our clientele.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.700]   We don't market, for instance.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.500]   So we're not selling our stuff.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.940]   People are coming to us and there's an easier fit.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.180]   And so we're able to charge lower fees
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.940]   because we're doing less for people.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.060]   And then people know that.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.340]   They're like, well, if I'm paying you 12 basis points,
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.800]   I don't expect that much from you.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.540]   And it's like a really good signal.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.740]   And so I think there is a place
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.460]   for this really low fee, low touch model.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.060]   - So by low touch, you mean,
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.340]   if I were to call up Elm Wealth and say,
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.060]   I want some guidance on whether to pay off my house
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.940]   versus invest in the market, you can't put a CFP
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.760]   or you wouldn't put a CFP on the line
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.340]   to help answer that question.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.940]   - We would try to have a brief conversation about it,
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.740]   but it wouldn't be as deep as a real financial planner,
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.900]   you know, that a real financial planner
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.560]   would go deeper, deeper, deeper.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.840]   Like we can have a couple of conversations
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.860]   with each of our clients each year.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.760]   We probably don't have that many, but that's right.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   I mean, it's just a higher level, shallower take on things.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.180]   - So I wanted to ask about long-term capital management,
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.860]   which was fairly early in your career.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.540]   I think most people will be aware of what happened there,
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.260]   but you have written that that was a life-changing event
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.860]   for you having worked on long-term capital,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.060]   and it really influenced the way
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.580]   that you think about the world,
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.820]   that you think about markets
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.620]   and your career and everything else.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.600]   Can you summarize your key takeaways from that?
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.240]   We could do this whole session on that,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.600]   but from that experience?
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   - So, you know, in terms of my takeaways
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   about how markets work and investing works and so on,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.640]   I think, you know, the most salient thing
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.520]   that I could say about,
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.360]   the most salient thing that comes to my mind
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   is just what a great reminder or illustration
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.640]   of how incredibly efficient markets are.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.620]   So we were finding all of these things,
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.240]   you know, asset A versus asset B,
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.340]   they were almost the same,
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.440]   but they were trading at a different price,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.840]   and we would buy the cheap one and sell the expensive one,
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.360]   and you could see that those prices
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   were not the right prices,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.600]   same cash flows, different prices.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.720]   You know, this was like, you know,
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.120]   we didn't call it arbitrage,
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.480]   but this is kind of the idea of arbitrage,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.240]   but the markets are so efficient
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.400]   that the amount of that disparity is so small.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.260]   I mean, it's identifiable, but it's so small
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.620]   that it doesn't really pay people to do it
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:25.740]   unless you use leverage.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.240]   Well, now, as soon as you use leverage,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.140]   you're subject to the spreads widening out
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.380]   and needing to reduce and becoming riskier
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.260]   and more volatile, and so, you know,
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.480]   what seems like a kind of a free lunch
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.380]   being offered by the market in reality,
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.380]   you know, is connected to, you know,
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.280]   is not a free lunch, you know,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.240]   there's risk involved, you're getting compensated for risk,
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   and then, you know, it turns out
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.720]   that a lot of these things that kind of look like alpha
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:03.280]   lose, you know, have this tendency to lose a lot of money
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.440]   when the stock market is down huge,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.680]   and so you're doing these things
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.520]   that kind of look like they're alpha
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.000]   because in normal times, you're making money,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.840]   and it's not correlated with the ups and downs
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.740]   of the stock market, but you go into
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.500]   a really big financial crisis like 2008.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.700]   Now, our thing was in 1998.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.980]   Thankfully, it was in '98.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.020]   It saved me 10 years.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.060]   Otherwise, I would've been working for another 10 years,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.260]   and then, you know, hit 2008,
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.240]   and it would've been a disaster.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.980]   But, you know, in 2008, like, you know,
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.580]   the financial crisis, you know,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.100]   caused all of the banks and lending institutions
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.700]   to pull back balance sheet.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.220]   All of these relative value opportunities blew out,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.180]   became riskier, people had to reduce.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.160]   It was a disaster, and so my LTCM experience,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   lots and lots of life-changing lessons,
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.760]   but I think that it's just such a great reminder for me
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.920]   or illustration of how efficient markets are.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.760]   - Last question.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.840]   I'm hoping you can answer really quickly, Victor,
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.740]   before we take a break.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.980]   You end your book with a quote from Milton Berle,
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.060]   which is that money can't buy you happiness,
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.900]   but it helps you look for it in a lot more places.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.260]   Can you talk about how your perspective
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.140]   on money and happiness has changed
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.860]   since you started your career?
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.260]   - Sure, so when I started, like, I don't know,
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.140]   I was just so happy to have a job.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.020]   You know, I was so grateful to have a job,
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.760]   and I loved my job in Wall Street.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.100]   I started off in research in 1984 at Salomon Brothers.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.700]   It was amazing, and every day,
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.980]   I just couldn't believe that this was meant to be work.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.920]   It was so much fun, and I just wasn't thinking about money,
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.260]   but wow, the money was just out of control.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.900]   I mean, it was, I don't know, every year,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.340]   they were just paying me so much more than they should have
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.900]   or I thought I was worth or whatever,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.580]   and it went up and up and up.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.060]   And then, you know, and then I left Salomon
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.180]   and went and joined my partners to found this hedge fund,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.900]   LTCM, and then the money just kept going on up,
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.360]   and it felt really good,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.300]   but I wasn't really spending it on anything
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.460]   'cause I was really busy,
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.960]   so it was like it was this counting thing,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.740]   like it was just, you know, so it was like,
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.180]   wow, it's nice to have a lot of money.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.700]   I wonder what I'll, you know, like I just was so busy,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.740]   I just wasn't thinking about it.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.700]   I don't know what I was thinking about.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.820]   You know, it was just so strung out, you know,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.620]   between kids and work and family and everything.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.220]   And then, you know, LTCM came, and boom, you know,
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.960]   I took a huge, you know, I don't know, you know,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.540]   my family, we lost, you know, 80% of our wealth at that time
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.140]   and then I really paid attention.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.460]   (laughs)
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.780]   And, you know, and then I really thought about,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.020]   you know, I started to really think about wealth and so on,
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.820]   and, you know, and that's when I started
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.180]   to really think about, you know,
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.940]   this idea that's just very basic in economics
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.100]   that there is a decreasing marginal utility
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.160]   to more and more wealth.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.120]   The more wealth we have,
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.820]   each extra dollar is just worth less for us.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.740]   It's like, you know, how many, you know,
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.300]   it's with almost everything in life,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.900]   there's a marginal decrease in the joy
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.580]   that we get from things as we get more and more of it.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.940]   And when I started to realize that, you know,
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.940]   I realized that wealth has to be a means to an end.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.700]   It can't be an end in itself.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.200]   And it had me, at that time, I really re-evaluated my life.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.620]   I took a 10-year sabbatical to kind of reboot,
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   re-educate where I wasn't working.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.460]   My kids were young.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.540]   You know, I was an at-home dad for 10 years
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.900]   before I started Elm Wealth.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:40.140]   And so, yeah, LTCM was like a shock therapy for me
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.860]   that got me, hopefully, to look at things
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.620]   in a more holistic manner.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.580]   - Well, Victor, we are so grateful to you
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.540]   for being here today.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.580]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.780]   - Thank you, Christine, yeah, it's a pleasure.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.000]   you
