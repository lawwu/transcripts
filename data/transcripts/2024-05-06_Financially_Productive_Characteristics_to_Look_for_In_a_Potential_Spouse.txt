[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.420]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.260]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.940]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.940]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.980]   I'm your host and on today's podcast, I want to explore some of the traits, characteristics,
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.580]   and attributes that a wise and thoughtful and strategic young man or young woman could
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.300]   and should look for in a prospective spouse that are likely to be highly correlated with
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700]   long-term financial productivity.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.300]   In fact, I think highly causative of long-term financial productivity.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.260]   One of the things that's most interesting to me as we look at personal finance and we
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.820]   look at the world that we live in is we all understand that the person that you choose
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.300]   to marry makes an enormous difference in the quality of your life as well as objective
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.620]   long-term outcomes.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.980]   How long you live, how much wealth you have, we know that's true.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.920]   We know that marriage is highly correlated with positive financial outcomes.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.220]   Married people accumulate significantly more wealth than non-married people.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.660]   They earn higher incomes.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.580]   Basically every factor across society is higher for married people and significantly higher
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.860]   and this confounds even cohabitating couples who are not married.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.940]   They are not nearly as productive at creating and accumulating wealth as married people.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.500]   So we understand that marriage is going to dramatically impact the long-term outcomes
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.540]   that you have in life and we understand that those outcomes are going to be financially
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.540]   measurable.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.100]   On the most recent podcast, I shared with you some ideas on how to find and attract
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.560]   the spouse of your dreams and in a moment I'll tell you exactly why.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.580]   But there's a piece of content or advice that I myself have never come across in the world
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.660]   of personal finance and financial literature.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.340]   And that line of thinking is simply what should you look for in a potential spouse that is
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.100]   likely to lead to your becoming wealthy together as a couple.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.580]   Now it may exist out there.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.100]   I've not gone specifically looking for it.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.020]   What I'm saying is that after a lifetime and a career of consuming personal finance literature
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.180]   and discussions, I've not come across anybody who's talked about this.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.700]   And so I want to open the conversation up with some ideas on this.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   To me, it seems obvious that we should talk about this.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.460]   And I think I understand why we don't.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.940]   After all, very few of us are strategic in pursuing marriage.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.140]   It would be very unusual to have a handsome young 20-year-old guy who has a list of all
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.020]   of the things that if I just pursue these things and if my potential marriage candidate,
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.620]   the woman that I'm pursuing has these factors, then I'm definitely going to marry her.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.100]   But if she doesn't, I'm not.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.100]   And it's very unusual for, first of all, any young person to be strategic about marriage
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.220]   and even more unusual for that person to be strategic in financial terms.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.980]   After all, we would quickly, those of us with experience, we would quickly rush to diminish
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.060]   the importance of financial productivity in favor of other more compelling metrics of
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.140]   life satisfaction, such as happiness and contentment and peacefulness and other things.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.420]   And after all, we all recognize that it's probably better to be happy and content and
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.540]   satisfied with life and not financially wealthy than to be financially wealthy and not happy
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.780]   and content and satisfied with life.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.340]   And there is a train of debate and discussion that happens on this.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.660]   Simply does earning ability predict happiness and satisfaction?
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.900]   Well, I think that these things are highly correlated and I don't think you have to choose
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.820]   one or the other.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.140]   I think that you can be rich and be happy.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.380]   It's not impossible.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.540]   And so to say that would you choose to be rich or to be happy is a false dilemma.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.500]   And similarly to say would you choose a marriage that is financially productive or that leads
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.940]   to happiness and long-term success in life is a false dilemma.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.180]   There's no reason to pull these things apart.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.100]   We can recognize that both of them are important and we can recognize it while keeping priority.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.260]   So it would be similar to say is it possible to be virtuous or righteous and rich.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.780]   It would be silly to say that you couldn't accomplish both of those things, but each
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.780]   man is going to have a different priority.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.300]   You will say I'm going to choose to do the right thing regardless of whether it costs
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.500]   me because I believe that it's more important for me to be morally righteous than for me
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   to be rich.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.460]   Another man would say I'm going to prioritize being rich because I'd rather be a rich scoundrel
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.060]   than a righteous pauper.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.020]   So similarly it's a false choice to say that we can choose between a marriage relationship
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.500]   that is likely to lead to financial productivity or that's likely to lead to happiness.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.140]   Why not have a marriage relationship that is optimized for both of those things?
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.900]   And we can optimize and say that happiness is more important to me than financial productivity
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.480]   without saying that financial productivity is unimportant.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.620]   And so if we're going to talk in the context of finance, we ought to at least start the
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.900]   conversation and discuss what are the factors that you should look for in a high quality,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.940]   high value potential spouse that are likely to lead to the long-term outcome.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.640]   I think we know intuitively what some of those qualities are.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.980]   It would be very unusual to find a beautiful, smart, attractive young woman who is not attracted
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.820]   to a man who has a high earning capacity.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.860]   That would be a normal thing that happens in society that we all kind of naturally understand.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.580]   But there's a lot more to it than just well he makes a lot of money.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.480]   And so I think we should talk about these factors and consider them and consider what
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.180]   we should optimize for and how we should go about it.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.980]   And I understand that most people are not strategic in pursuing a developing marriage.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.980]   I wasn't.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.060]   Most of us aren't.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.500]   Most of us kind of just end up in a situation that we're in and sometimes we're happy with
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.020]   it, sometimes we're not.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.700]   But just because people in the past weren't strategic doesn't mean that no one was strategic.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.420]   And just because perhaps many people were not strategic in the past doesn't mean that
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.220]   you shouldn't be strategic today or that your children shouldn't be strategic.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.060]   After all, one of the great challenges that is different in this year than perhaps some
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.180]   decades back is that we formerly had a strong marriage culture, at least in the culture
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.660]   that I'm from, the Western tradition from the United States of America personally but
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.180]   across broadly Western culture.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:45.540]   We formerly had a strong marriage culture that made strategy unnecessary for most people.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.300]   But that culture is gone.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.980]   The culture that we live in is not facilitating marriage.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.900]   Young people are not connecting with one another, they're not dating one another, they're not
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.380]   having sexual relationships with one another.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.020]   And when they are having sexual relationships and dating one another, those relationships
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.300]   are not automatically leading to marriage.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.460]   The relationships that do lead to marriage are not automatically leading to children.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.800]   So those of us who are older have to roll up our sleeves and get involved and try to
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.380]   figure out what do we do differently.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:23.260]   And even if it's hopeless for, let's say, a 30-year-old guy or gal today, it's not hopeless
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.060]   for my children, and it's not hopeless for your children, and it's not hopeless for the
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.540]   30-year-old guy or gal today either.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.780]   So just because our culture is gone doesn't mean that you and I can't employ strategy
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:41.260]   in the face of cultural opposition to get the long-term outcomes that stable marriages
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.220]   and productive marriages entail.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.780]   And what I'm trying to do in this series is I'm trying to bring open the discussion in
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.140]   your own mind so that you can think about what you agree with, what you appreciate,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.760]   what you don't, as always, take what's useful, discard the rest.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.180]   But I want you to make you think about what you want and what you envision, and I want
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.940]   you to think long-term so that you have strategic foundation for your decisions, not just being
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.060]   ruled by your emotions.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.380]   And I want you to develop options.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.740]   One of the reasons I spent so much time in the previous episode talking about a framework
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.060]   to develop your own attractiveness, basically, is to help you develop options.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:30.180]   One reason very few young men and women are strategic in who they would pursue for marriage
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.260]   is that most people just don't have that many options.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.220]   It's very unusual for a young man or woman to be sitting back with five potential marriage
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.660]   candidates and be strategically assessing, "Well, let's see.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.900]   Candidate number one has a cumulative score of 87 points, and candidate number two is
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.980]   84.3 points.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.100]   What kind of tiebreaker could I employ between candidates one and two?"
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.580]   That's not how life works.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.620]   Normally, you just have an option that comes along at a point in your life in which you're
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.540]   thinking about it, and you're open to it, and boom, you move forward.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.380]   And I'm not opposed to that.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.100]   I think that's okay.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.980]   But for a young man or woman who has options, is that the best way to go about it?
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.860]   Now we can find this most effectively in literature, usually from the female perspective.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.980]   If we go back and we read many works of literature, and we find a very attractive woman, or in
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.660]   some cases a very attractive man with an annual income of $19,000, if we find an attractive
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:36.140]   man or woman, there will be a variety of people who are interested in that man or woman.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.060]   And of course, there's some love story that ensues to where the person finds ultimately
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.380]   true love.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.220]   And so my point is to articulate that, because when I was a teenager, nobody spoke to me
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:52.660]   seriously in the way that I will speak to my sons and sons seriously and say, "Listen,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.460]   you need to maximize your attractiveness and your value in all dimensions in order for
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.420]   you to have the chance of attracting a high-quality spouse."
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.420]   Nobody did that.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   And so I just didn't...
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.420]   I never thought about it.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.020]   And it seems obvious to say it, but I never thought about it.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.820]   And so if I never thought about it, I figure there's probably two or three other guys in
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.460]   the world who haven't thought about it, two or three other girls in the world that haven't
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.460]   thought about it.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.500]   And in today's world, what I see is that a lot of people aren't thinking about it even
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.300]   in terms of spousal attraction.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.420]   There's an enormous conflict happening among young people today who are not married, where
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:36.380]   they're optimizing for sexual appeal and sexual activity and relationships that are not leading
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.620]   to marriage rather than optimizing for marriage.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.860]   And we see clearly where that goes and the toxic culture that it creates for young men
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.980]   and women.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.900]   And so we have to find other strategies.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.380]   So forgive me for a very long intro, but this really, really matters.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.140]   And I want to provide you...
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.900]   I want to at least stimulate your thinking to think about, "If I want to be rich and
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.980]   if I'm going to get married, then what should I look for?"
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:09.140]   The spouse that you marry will do three important things, will have three important impacts
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.300]   on your financial future.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:20.220]   First, your spousal selection will enormously impact your immediate and long-term financial
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.700]   future on the positive side, meaning your income, the money that you make, the investments
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.580]   that you earn, the trajectory of your career.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.980]   Your spousal selection can make a huge difference on that.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.940]   Let's go through those for just a moment.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:43.100]   Obviously, the most glaring example is what income does my spouse earn?
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.900]   If you are a young woman and you marry a man who is earning $50,000 a year and doesn't
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:56.780]   have much potential beyond cost of living raises in his life, as compared to a man who
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:02.900]   is in a highly paid career or on a highly paid career trajectory and has a potential
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.820]   to earn $500,000 a year, there's going to be an obvious difference in your long-term
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:14.100]   wealth based upon that selection between those potential husbands.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.140]   So the income is direct and clear.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.240]   But there's a more important in terms of a career trajectory for all of us.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:28.420]   Let's say that you're a young man and you're married to a woman who complements your career
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.140]   choice or a woman who you're constantly fighting with in your career choice.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.820]   This can take many different expressions.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.100]   It can take an expression in terms of where you need to live for your couple, for both
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.900]   of your incomes, how you need to approach it, how much she wants you to come home from
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.420]   work early because that's where she is versus how much she supports you working late, working
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:56.160]   on the weekends, going for it, taking risks, living small and frugally so that you can
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.260]   accumulate investment capital.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.440]   These things are enormously impactful long-term and it's the relational dynamics that make
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.300]   a big, big difference.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.720]   So enormously impact to your short and long-term financial future on the positive side is going
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.540]   to be determined based upon the specific person that you marry.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.780]   Now we can flip it to the negative side.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.500]   The spouse that you marry is going to enormously impact your long-term financial future on
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.980]   the negative side.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.480]   The big one is risk of divorce.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.900]   You may lose a decade of financial productivity.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.180]   If you marry somebody, you're in it for a decade and then there's a divorce and all
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.360]   of a sudden your net worth is destroyed.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.260]   You lose several years of productive work that are now spent fighting in divorce court.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.940]   It's enormously disruptive.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.480]   But also then on the expense side, the expenses that are associated with this particular person
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.220]   that you marry are going to be enormously impactful.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.200]   And then the third aspect is the really long-term financial future of your descendants in terms
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.940]   of genetics, of your children, the way that your children are brought up, the culture
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.820]   that your children have, they're enormously important.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:09.020]   And careful spousal selection is the magic key to solving all three of these things because
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.620]   none of these are random factors that just happen to you.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.620]   In a moment or in the middle of this show, I will relate to you some stories of a marriage
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:24.300]   researcher and his story is that he can predict divorce with 91% reliability, whether a couple
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.340]   will stay married or whether a couple will divorce.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.060]   And it's just an example to show that there are things that you can look for in any situation
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.220]   to know how likely you are to divorce.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.700]   All the signs are there as to is this person that I'm likely to marry or that I want to
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:44.740]   marry, is this person likely to be a dog walker or a doctor?
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.860]   The signs are all there from an early age and so you're not wrong to look for these
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.860]   things.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.820]   Remember, I think you can and should be extremely picky prior to marriage.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.700]   Once you're married, then you're all in on marriage, but you should be very picky prior
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   to marriage.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:07.040]   And you, with this decision of the person that you're going to marry, you, as in no
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.940]   other decision, you deserve to be entirely selfish about your decisions.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.820]   Now, why don't people do that?
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.420]   Well, they don't think about it and they don't develop themselves to be able to attract a
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.420]   very high quality spouse and it's not surprising.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.140]   Most people who are unmarried, it's not surprising that they're unmarried if you have a little
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.460]   bit of experience in life and you just look and understand, well, it's not, duh, of course
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.000]   this person's not married.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.140]   What does he bring to the table?
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.260]   What does she bring to the table?
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.260]   What is he doing?
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   What is she doing with her time?
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.460]   Who is she meeting?
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.380]   And as I described in detail in the previous episode, it's a function of what are you looking
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.380]   for?
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   Do you know that?
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.660]   Have you optimized your personal traits of attractiveness so that you can attract the
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.900]   people that you want to attract and repel the people that you want to repel?
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.740]   And then have you been invested into going and finding the kinds of places where people
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.180]   are that are likely to be in a relationship with you?
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.500]   It's not magic.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.780]   It's a math formula based upon what you're looking for and it should be relatively normal
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.900]   for an attractive young man or an attractive young woman to have a few options.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:21.380]   And that's not abnormal where you see the proof, the evidence of this most starkly in
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:27.700]   today's world is just look at the options that a beautiful woman or a very highly developed,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.960]   high value man has in the dating marketplace.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.820]   This young man or woman has many options to choose among and it's that balance between
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   recognizing okay, some things are innate but not everything is innate and a young man or
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.900]   woman can develop himself or herself to be attractive, to have multiple options and that
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.020]   puts you in a different situation.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:56.260]   And you should be very picky about what you are looking for in a prospective partner.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.600]   Then when you marry, be all in on marriage.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.220]   So I'm trying to help you to think about what I want you to have options by engaging in
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.420]   sufficient levels of personal development, developing your own attractive qualities that
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.860]   would be attractive to your ideal spouse and then doing that young enough so you don't
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.260]   have your back up against the wall.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.540]   You're 30 years old, now all of a sudden you're going to get serious about life, well that's
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.780]   probably not the best time to do it.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.180]   You don't want to have your back up against the wall, you want to really be doing this
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:30.780]   early so that you have time and you can patiently look and think beyond just the short term,
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.400]   you know, I feel good when I'm with him or whatever the short term things are.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:41.620]   You need to become a person of value who brings something to the table so that you can attract
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.740]   a high quality, high value spouse.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   Now what should you look for?
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.300]   Well, I'd like to characterize what you should look for into three different categories because
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.380]   I think it's useful for analysis and I'm not going to give you a comprehensive list.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.620]   I just want to stimulate your thinking so that you can make your own list.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:05.440]   But I think if we characterize these things on different levels, then we'll understand,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.200]   we'll be able to develop in the fullness of time a more comprehensive list.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.840]   Some of the traits that you should look for in a potential marriage partner are genetic
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.280]   and they're genuinely physically genetic traits.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:29.580]   Some are long term traits that are not quite genetic but that are very, very enduring in
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.460]   terms of their impact.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.940]   The kind of childhood that somebody had is not necessarily a genetic trait on the physical
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.940]   level.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.980]   But yet it has enduring influence and will probably affect this person's view and outlook
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.420]   on life for the rest of his or her life.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:52.500]   And then some traits are relatively easily changed and they're skills that can be attracted
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   and developed.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.060]   For example, let's say that your initial response to when I say what should you look for in
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.660]   a spouse to enhance your financial future, you might say something like, "I want to marry
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.660]   someone who's good with money."
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.800]   Okay, great.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.540]   But what does that mean?
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.540]   Does that mean skilled at budgeting?
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.140]   You want to marry somebody who's skilled at budgeting?
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.580]   I don't think much of that because that's a skill that can be learned in six weeks to
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.580]   six months.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.420]   It's not that hard to develop a skill at budgeting.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.460]   You can be done with that in six weeks to six months.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.500]   Or do you mean by I want to marry someone who's good with money, I want to marry someone
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.660]   who earns a million dollars a year?
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   Well, earning a million dollars a year is a skill that is usually going to take, I would
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.580]   say, at least a minimum of a decade to develop.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.980]   I don't know anybody who's done it in less than a decade and often much, much longer.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.660]   Sometimes that's multiple decades and there's so many underlying skills that are necessary
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.660]   to earn a million dollars a year.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.780]   So which of those things do you mean when you say I want to marry someone who's good
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.100]   with money?
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.740]   Again, I would be happy if I'm going to choose somebody – if I clearly recognize that earning
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.260]   a million dollars a year is more important than being good at budgeting $40,000 a year,
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.940]   then I need to figure out what's the environment, what are the skill sets that put someone on
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.580]   the 10-year path to earning a million dollars a year.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.300]   That's the key thing to optimize for.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.700]   The budgeting can be fixed pretty easily.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.820]   So we'll look at some positive traits to look for.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.160]   Now, there's one more question I want to talk through and the question is should this
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.020]   be a conversation that is sex specific?
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.940]   Should this be a conversation where I say husbands, here's what you should look for
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.780]   in potential wives and potential wives, here's what you should look for in potential husbands,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.180]   or should I use the inclusive term of spouse?
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.420]   I'm not opposed to sexism generally.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   I'm a man.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.140]   I enjoy spending my time with men.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.420]   I don't really spend time with women.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.560]   I'm a five-woman man.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.900]   I've got a wife, I've got a daughter, I've got a mother, and I've got two sisters.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.780]   That's about most of the women that I spend time with in my life.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.420]   And I enjoy my life that way.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.180]   And the audience of Radical Personal Finance is predominantly male.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:11.820]   But I don't think that this conversation is one where we should automatically be sex-specific
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.940]   in how we talk about and what we do and how we deal with things.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.980]   I think that it's hard in our current very androgynous age, it's hard to determine where
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.060]   the lines should be drawn, but there are lines that need to be drawn.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.020]   And I think that some marriage strategies are the same for men and women and some are
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.820]   different.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:37.500]   In addition though, we need to go beyond marriage and recognize that your strategy will be different
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.820]   depending on whether you're optimizing for marriage or whether you're optimizing for
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:50.480]   reproduction and long-term family vitality, as in children and grandchildren.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.020]   Because these things are two different things.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.840]   I'm going to be talking about marriage, but in the back of your mind, because that's what
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.980]   I've titled my show, but in the back of your mind you need to distinguish between marriage
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.740]   and long-term family formation.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:10.060]   And it's important that you understand that there is a somewhat robust circle of social
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.140]   -- I hate to use the word "science" for social science, but I don't know another word -- social
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.580]   science that we can look at.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.820]   We can look at some data, we can look at some studies, some analysis, and try to form some
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.180]   opinions that are informed by data and research in this area.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.480]   But you probably don't need the research.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:32.560]   What you probably need to do is just simply be willing to confirm your bias, be willing
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.760]   to confirm your natural knowledge of the world.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.860]   Because we've all seen how relationships naturally function in our life.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.980]   So let's talk about, for example, a male doctor marrying versus a female doctor.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.580]   And with this we'll introduce a couple of terms that are important to think about.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:59.180]   So first, let's say you have an equally qualified male doctor, female doctor, high income earning,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:04.340]   high status profession, huge amounts of intelligence needed, huge amounts of grit, some of the
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:10.420]   factors that are highly correlated with positive financial expectativity.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:18.500]   So we could see that a male doctor can be attracted to and happily marry a female doctor.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.180]   This happens all the time.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.980]   A male doctor can be attracted to and happily marry a female doctor.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:31.580]   The male doctor can be attracted to and happily marry a female school teacher.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:38.240]   But it's unlikely that a female doctor, it's unlikely for a female doctor to marry a male
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.700]   school teacher.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.860]   And it's not just in terms of exposure.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.900]   It's not just in terms of, well, they didn't meet each other because they were in different
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.900]   schools.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.900]   There is an element of that.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.160]   But there's something deeper related to it.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.220]   The first trend that we clearly see across society is the trend of homogamy.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.960]   Homogamy is defined in the social sciences, the marriage between individuals who are in
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.540]   some culturally important way similar to each other.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.180]   It's a form of assortative mating.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:17.020]   And the marriage union can be based on similarity of socioeconomic status, class, gender, caste,
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.540]   ethnicity, or religion, or age in age homogamy.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.940]   So these are all expressions of homogamy.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.700]   I'm reading directly from the Wikipedia article on homogamy here.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.520]   Now we would contrast homogamy with heterogamy.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.100]   So homogamy, similarities, and heterogamy, differences from one another.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.980]   So in sociology, heterogamy refers to a marriage between two individuals that differ in a certain
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.260]   criterion, including all of those that I just listed.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.580]   Very common expressions of heterogamy in today's world would be age heterogamy, so partners
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:59.060]   marrying at disparate ages, ethnic heterogamy, partners of different ethnicities marrying,
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.700]   and of course social class and all of these things are relevant to it.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.820]   You have, what was that old movie, The Businessman Marries the Prostitute.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:14.740]   These kinds of things are always the substance of literature and discussion and we love them.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.260]   And so what you see if you think about homogamy and heterogamy is you can see that we're simultaneously
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.720]   attracted to both of these things.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.940]   There's a reason that in, again, if you don't have this in your life, you can find it in
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.940]   literature.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.660]   There's a reason why people marry someone of our class or of our culture or of our religion.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:39.180]   There's a reason also that we simultaneously have an appreciation and a fixation with the
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:48.740]   wealthy guy marrying the poor girl, the prince marrying the servant girl, the businessman
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   marrying the prostitute, the people of Romeo and Juliet from different families.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.860]   There's all this fascination with this integration with people similar to each other and different
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.420]   from each other.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:10.640]   And these are important because some people and some factors are very important to marriage.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.820]   Some factors are less important to marriage.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.660]   Some factors are very important to reproduction and some factors are less important to reproduction.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.420]   Now we have our first our discussion of homogamy.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:26.640]   Now similarly we can then move to a different term and the term is hypergamy.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:34.300]   Hypergamy, what we would refer to in non-clinical terms as dating up or marrying up, is a term
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:41.900]   that is used for a person who dates or marries a spouse of a higher social status or sexual
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.580]   capital than that individual person.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:51.420]   And the antonym for hypergamy would be hypogamy and these are the basic balancing between
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.420]   them.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:28:00.180]   The experience that men and women have for hypergamy or hypogamy is different.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.300]   I can demonstrate this to you by just looking at popular cultures.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:12.660]   What is usually the case is that men are not particularly concerned with the social class
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:20.780]   or the earning ability or some external feature of a woman that they're attracted to.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.740]   Men tend to not necessarily be hypergamous.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:31.100]   That doesn't mean that they want to be married to a woman who is very dissimilar to them.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.260]   So that's why we don't talk about hypogamy.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.820]   Nobody really wants to be married to somebody who is dissimilar.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:42.980]   What it means is that men aren't generally pursuing somebody of a higher class or status
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.260]   as a very important part of their life.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.220]   And again I would go back to pretty woman.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.940]   Here you have the wealthy successful businessman who is attracted to the prostitute who has
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:58.700]   made a series of unfortunate decisions but at her inner being she has a heart of gold
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.260]   and of course somehow she's going to make him mad, make him happy because of who she
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.980]   is and so he pursues her and attracts her and marries her.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.300]   That would be pretty woman.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.500]   What you don't generally see is the opposite.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:20.180]   You don't generally see any, I couldn't name any movies, where there's an incredibly attractive,
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:27.660]   successful, beautiful woman who then goes and marries a male dud with no prospects.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:33.220]   When you see this reflected in popular culture you wind up with movies that are more like
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.100]   the movie The Proposal.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.460]   So in The Proposal you have Sandra Bullock who is a high-powered editor and high-powered
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:46.300]   businesswoman and all of a sudden she decides, she finds out she's going to be kicked out
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.420]   of the United States and be deported to Canada unless she has a relationship.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:55.940]   So in a fit of desperation she goes after her poorly paid assistant and says, "Well
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.980]   actually, you're going to be my fiancé."
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:05.300]   And basically she manipulates and coerces him into being her fiancé.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.140]   But then of course in the long run they wind up madly in love and together.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.140]   Well why?
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:15.300]   Well what it turns out that her fiancé, though he had a low-paying job, was actually
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.220]   from a wealthy elite family in Alaska where they basically owned half of the Alaskan town
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.220]   that they were from.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.300]   And you know he's actually a really high-quality guy.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.340]   So even though the initial indications of her status in life were different, even though
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.340]   he was her assistant and a lowly paid lackey, in reality he's actually this really fabulous
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:40.940]   amazing guy and this temporary and wealthy and sophisticated and accomplished, but in
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.120]   this temporary low point in his life of being an assistant was just part of a strategic
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.100]   desire to find himself.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.820]   And so you can see this throughout our culture and there's good data done on this.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.620]   You're a podcast listener and this is a podcast ad.

[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   There's been various studies in the social studies that across people, across culture,
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.860]   men and women approach relationships differently and they look for different things.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:30.500]   And so there is an element of sex specificity that is necessary because the competitive
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.620]   strategies for men are different than the competitive strategies for women.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:43.140]   Women can optimize for features such as high income, high status, high power, but they're
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.520]   less important than optimizing for other features because men are looking for different things
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.180]   than wives and wives are looking for husbands.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.900]   And so some of the big problems that we face though in our current society is that the
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:03.580]   traditional ways in which these were facilitated for and structured for, some of them are working
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.560]   better than ever designed and some of them are working worse than ever designed.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.620]   So homogamy as an example, right now in our current culture we have more and more homogamous
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.980]   relationships than ever before.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:21.340]   And the homogamy though is primarily related to intellectual ability and which for which
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.700]   we can use education as the proxy.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.540]   I first started thinking about this maybe a decade ago when I read Charles Murray's
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:34.060]   book called Coming Apart and that was where I first met the word homogamy.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:40.060]   And what we see is simply that our society, the whole thesis of coming apart which I think
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:45.420]   is continuing as best I can tell, is simply that the rich are getting richer and the poor
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.640]   are getting poorer but it's not just in financial terms, it's basically in every terms.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:55.800]   Our societies are becoming more and more intensely segregated, not based upon skin color necessarily,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.040]   not based upon wealth necessarily, but based upon all of the features related to it.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   And a big one is intelligence and in terms of relationships, intelligence is an enormous
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:17.960]   element of the long-term future of our society as well as your own children.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.880]   So let me read a short passage from my copy of Coming Apart.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.200]   Before the age – this is from a section titled The Increase in Cognitive Homogamy.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.080]   Before the age of mobility, people commonly married someone from the same town or from
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.440]   the same neighborhood of an urban area.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.480]   The events that threw people together seldom had anything to do specifically with cognitive
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.000]   ability.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.840]   Similar cognitive ability was a source of compatibility between a young man and a young
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.720]   woman and some degree of cognitive homogamy existed, but it was a haphazard process.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.560]   Meanwhile, educational homogamy was high because hardly anyone went to college.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.160]   In large proportions of married couples, both had less than a high school education or both
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   had a high school diploma.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.040]   As the proportion of college graduates increased, so did the possibilities for greater educational
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.840]   homogamy at the top.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.600]   As college graduates found, they had more potential marriage partners who were also
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.320]   college graduates.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.560]   Drawing on the extensive technical literature and the CPS, sociologists Christine Schwartz
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:26.080]   and Robert Marr examined trends in assortative marriage as it was known in the jargon from
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.400]   1940 to 2003.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.840]   They found that homogamy has increased at both ends of the educational scale.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.440]   College graduates grew more likely to marry college graduates and high school dropouts
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.560]   grew more likely to marry other high school dropouts.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.040]   For our purposes, trying to understand how the new upper class came to be, the effects
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.000]   of increased educational attainment may be seen in a simple measure.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.800]   In 1960, just 3% of American couples both had a college degree.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.640]   By 2010, that proportion stood at 25%.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.720]   The change was so large that it was a major contributor to the creation of a new class
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.360]   all by itself.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.520]   But increased educational homogamy had another consequence that the academic literature on
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.920]   homogamy avoids mentioning.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:15.240]   Increased educational homogamy inevitably means increased cognitive homogamy.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.080]   A college education starting with admission and continuing through to graduation is a
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.300]   series of cognitive tests.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.520]   To be able even to begin a major in engineering or the hard sciences, students have to be
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.080]   able to do advanced calculus and that in turn requires logical mathematical ability and
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.840]   roughly the top decile of the population.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.140]   To be able to cope with genuine college level material in the social sciences and humanities
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.660]   requires good linguistic ability and the top quartile of the distribution, if you're content
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.000]   with scraping by, closer to the top decile if you want to get good grades in a moderately
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.520]   demanding college.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.680]   To graduate means passing all these tests plus a general test for perseverance.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   We'll call that grit.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.200]   We'll come back to grit later.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.360]   The result is that each level of educational attainment, high school diploma, AA, BA, MA,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:05.040]   and professional degree or PhD, implies a mean IQ for people attaining that level that
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.400]   has been remarkably stable among whites at least since the beginning of the 1980s.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.880]   I must limit the numbers to whites as I present these data because aggressive affirmative
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.960]   action has produced means for African Americans and Latinos at each level of educational attainment
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.440]   that are substantially lower and more variable than the white means.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.800]   But since we are talking about the new upper class, there are good reasons to think in
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.280]   terms of the white means, partly because African Americans and Latinos who enter the new upper
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.640]   class have passed a number of career tests signifying that they approximate the white
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.720]   means on cognitive ability for each level of educational attainment.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.320]   And partly because the new upper class is still overwhelmingly white.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.200]   Table 2.1 shows the evidence for these stable means.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.840]   And let me just read you table 2.1.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.060]   And I'll use the 1982 to 1989 data.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:57.500]   So the mean IQ for the table is titled mean white IQ for levels of degree attainment
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.880]   in the NLSY-79 and NLSY-97.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.840]   So the mean IQ for persons completing no more than no degree is 88.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.880]   For persons completing no more than a high school diploma or GED is 99.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.960]   For persons completing no more than an associate's degree is 105.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:24.040]   Bachelor's degree 113 IQ, master's degree 117, PhD, LLD, MD, DDS is 126.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.160]   Now we'll come back to the transmission of cognitive ability to the next generation in
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   a moment.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.840]   The point, however, is that our society is sorting itself on many, many features.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.880]   And these features are important.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:46.220]   And this homogamy, that even though there is a tendency to say, "Oh, we don't care about
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.220]   being the same.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.660]   After all, we don't care about ethnic differences among couples.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.420]   We don't care necessarily about age disparities.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.420]   You do you.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.860]   You like who you like, etc."
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:02.140]   There's this intense homogamy that is happening in our society based upon the way that our
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:08.020]   society is now sorted and structured by educational institutions, careers, things like that.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:14.620]   And then that's mixed with the natural hypergamy or lack of hypergamy between men and women
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:20.420]   that is creating enormous pressure on young people and their mate selection.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.420]   And so these features and attributes need to be thought through, need to be understood
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.540]   if we're going to give people good advice.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.840]   So let's get to the advice.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.620]   What should you look for?
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.780]   Let's begin at the genetic level.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:38.140]   Let's begin with those traits that you should look for in a potential partner that are going
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.860]   to impact your life, your wealth production, and your children.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:49.220]   And let's start with those ones that are largely unalterable, which is what I'm calling the
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.460]   genetic traits.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.780]   The first one that you need to look for is good health and longevity.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.700]   And let me repeat for the 15th time.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:04.540]   You're listening to me in the comfort of your own ears.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:11.620]   That means, generally speaking, you're consuming my podcast in a private space.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:19.180]   Don't let anyone shame you and say that somehow you shouldn't be looking for the highest quality
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.420]   spouse that you can attract.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.780]   I'm saying this to you because I never would have believed it if I'd heard myself, if I've
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.100]   heard this advice when I was younger.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.500]   I would have seen myself as some kind of white knight to say, "Oh no, you know, I shouldn't
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.620]   have high standards of the person that I want to marry.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:43.500]   I shouldn't have requirements and even basic fundamental genetic requirements.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.020]   I should accept all people the way that they are."
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.480]   The problem with that is that real life happens.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.840]   And when real life happens, you start to understand that these basic features and characteristics
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.580]   that the partner that you marry has enormously impact your life.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.620]   And so it sounds enormously selfish for me to say to a young unmarried man or a young
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:14.340]   unmarried woman, you should look for a potential marriage partner who has robust health.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.420]   After all, all of us have friends who do not enjoy robust health.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.460]   All of us know people who don't enjoy robust health and all of us want desperately to help
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.560]   those people.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.260]   We want our friends who are unhealthy to get healthy.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.500]   We don't want to express the concept that I'm just going to not pick you because you're
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.700]   unhealthy.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.760]   We would never say that out loud and you don't have to say it out loud.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.660]   That's why the fact that you're listening to me in the comfort of your ears and the
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.780]   privacy of your own mind, you don't ever have to say any of this stuff to anybody out loud.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.780]   Nobody can judge you for the decisions you make, although you'll feel the pressure.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.140]   We live in a world in which, well, you can't judge me for whether I marry a man or a woman.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.100]   You can't judge me for the kind of person that I'm attracted to or not attracted to,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.980]   but yet you are facing enormous judgment if you say, "I'm only going to marry somebody
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   who is healthy."
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:08.780]   And yet what I'm telling you is that these things, if you're young, they matter.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.180]   And this is a cumulative set of factors.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:18.060]   These are a cumulative set of factors that you will have to choose.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:25.300]   But for every factor that you, what I'll call compromise on, what I mean is for every factor
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.900]   that on a scale of one to 10, you choose somebody who scores low on this factor, it's going
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.740]   to impact your life enormously.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:37.420]   If you marry somebody who is healthy, then the ease of your marriage, the ease of your
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.220]   finances are likely to be enormous.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.260]   Someone has a strong immune system, they're not susceptible to chronic diseases, they've
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.140]   got good overall physical fitness.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.900]   Just everything's easy and simple in that element of your married life.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:59.220]   On the other hand, you marry someone who's sick all the time, and now the pressure that
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.580]   puts upon your marriage is significant.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:09.640]   If you marry someone, you make a vow to be with them in sickness and in health, for better
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.820]   or worse, for richer and for poorer.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:18.420]   So once you are married to someone, you come to me and you say, "Hey, Joshua, you know,
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.380]   my husband or wife is sick all the time.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.380]   What do I do?"
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.140]   I'm going to be standing in front of you saying, "You absolutely have to support this person.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   This is your wife.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.940]   This is your husband that we're dealing with.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.740]   You owe this person a duty of care."
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.820]   And though that duty of care bankrupts you because you are paying for medical care, though
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.760]   you can't work because you're a full-time caregiver or whatever the situation is, I'm
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:49.240]   going to honor you for your faithfulness to your husband or wife in their time of sickness.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:56.760]   But prior to marriage, you have a choice, and it is smart for you to be as discriminating
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.800]   as you possibly can with your choices prior to marriage.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.920]   Now the flip side of this is simply the fact that there is a limit to the kind of person
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.960]   that you are going to be able to attract into a marriage relationship with you.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.380]   If you are a 2, you're going to have a very difficult time attracting a 10 into a relationship
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.520]   with you.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:27.000]   So if health is a component of what you would rate someone on, then, and you're a 2, you're
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.580]   probably going to be marrying a 1, a 2, or a 4.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.400]   You're not going to be marrying a 10.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   So you have a choice.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:40.020]   Either I'm willing to transform myself from a 2 to a 10 and do everything I can in other
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:46.880]   factors that I can control in order to attract a very high-quality spouse, or I'm going to
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.520]   settle for somebody who is closer to my age.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.840]   Settling is not a negative concept.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.760]   Everyone settles at some point in time for some reason.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.840]   People who don't settle are single for the rest of their life.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.440]   But there's a lot you can do to prepare yourself.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.600]   That's why I spent so much energy in the previous episode to try to make this point, that you
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   can change yourself.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.580]   You can go from a 2 to a 7, and then you'll have access to people who are a good match
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.700]   for you.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.720]   And so you want to change those things that you can change.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.840]   You may be able to change your health, but even if you can't change your health, there's
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.180]   a lot of other things that you can change, and what you'll see is that people who don't
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:29.580]   have robust health, if they'll give attention and focus to developing their other qualities,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:34.260]   they can still attract a very, very high-quality prospective spouse.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.780]   You see this all the time with people who are profoundly handicapped and yet have attracted
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:43.980]   a very high-quality spouse because they've developed other qualities.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:53.500]   So I'm sorry it's so long, but I think of myself at a younger age when I make my podcasts,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:00.140]   and I would have been, in my own mind, a guy who was willing to be a white knight.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:05.300]   I would have been a guy who was willing to say, "Oh, well, here's this wonderful girl,
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.780]   and after all, if I marry her, I can help her," right?
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:17.460]   And in hindsight, with the perspective of more than a decade of marriage and five children
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.740]   and everything that that involves, while I'm still young enough to remember being that
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:28.420]   guy, I look at it now and I realize no one ever told me how important it was to be entirely
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.340]   selfish with my selection of a spouse.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:40.140]   And I owe a good amount of the success and happiness of my marriage to me having some
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:49.440]   filters that were cultural filters built in, as well as just to God's providence, His blessings
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.580]   on my life.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.380]   I wasn't as strategic as I could have been and probably should have been, but once you're
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.780]   in it, you're in it.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:46:00.180]   So you deserve to be selfish in your thinking and write down exactly what you want, but
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.660]   then you also have to develop and cultivate the traits and attributes that are going to
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.380]   be able to attract someone.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:13.380]   So forgive the lengthy sidebar there, but it's really important that young people understand
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.900]   you can be selfish and you should be selfish about this as much as anything else.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.380]   You should be selfish about working in the kind of career that you want to work in, about
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.740]   marrying the kind of person that you want to marry.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.060]   You should be selfish about these things.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.900]   But you can't be selfish in a non-deserving way.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:36.140]   You can't say, "Well, I deserve to be a doctor," and not be willing to put in the really, really
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:41.580]   long years of work to develop yourself and the really long road to build the skills and
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.140]   pass the exams and pass the classes and get the degrees.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.360]   If you want to be a doctor, go for it.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.860]   But you prove that you deserve being a doctor with your work.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.700]   Similarly, you can't say, "Well, I just want to marry a 10, and I'm a 2, but I just deserve
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.700]   a 10."
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   Okay, well, if you're going to deserve a 10, you're going to have to transform yourself
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.900]   from a 2 to a 7, and you're going to have to work really, really hard to market yourself
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.500]   effectively until you convince the 10 to be with you.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.660]   And that's going to take you some time and a whole lot of work.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.220]   So I hope that's helpful.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.240]   Back to the list, what are the genetic traits that we should be screening for?
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.280]   Well, big one is good health and separately longevity, which is related to health but
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.480]   not determinative of it.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:30.800]   You want to look for a partner with a robust genetic predisposition to good health, and
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:39.880]   you should assess that and look for something that is likely to... and screen for somebody
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.960]   who is healthy.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:49.980]   If your partner is healthy, then he or she is going to be able to enjoy a more active
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.120]   lifestyle with you, you're going to have lower healthcare costs, you're going to be able
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.760]   to earn more money because you can work consistently.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.880]   If you ever get sick, you have understood, especially if you're sick for more than a
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.960]   few days, you understand how impossible it is to be financially productive when you're
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.280]   sick all the time.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.160]   A huge portion of our ability to earn money just comes from just the natural attribute
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.280]   of feeling good, feeling strong, being able to go to work and be effective on a day to
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.360]   day basis.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.720]   And when somebody gets sick, mentally sick, physically sick, everything falls apart.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.640]   And a lot of that stuff is predetermined by genetics.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.720]   And so you want to screen for that.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.920]   How do you screen for health?
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.320]   Well, I think first you should screen for what you know about, just knowledge of health
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.380]   conditions.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:38.300]   If you are, let's say, getting to know somebody and that person, you find out that person
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.220]   has some significant illness or chronic disease, then you should take that into account.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.940]   And that might be something that you say, "Okay, this is not for me because of this
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.280]   chronic disease."
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.780]   You should trust your own basic instincts related to health as well.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:59.020]   I think that one thing that Dr. Katherine Shanahan, the author of the book Deep Nutrition
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:08.360]   convinced me of is that various aspects of what we call beauty can be considered as markers
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.020]   for health.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:18.060]   Beauty, which is often related to symmetry, has a strong genetic component related to
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.060]   it.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.340]   And if you're interested in that discussion, read Dr. Katherine Shanahan's book called
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.220]   Deep Nutrition where she discusses it extensively.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.620]   She may have published other things on it.
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.220]   That's just where I came up with it.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:36.380]   But in general, we are attracted to various markers of beauty as being related to someone
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.800]   who is healthy.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:44.340]   For example, let's say that somebody has a highly symmetrical face and body.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.500]   We're likely to say, "Hey, that person is really beautiful because of the symmetry of
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.180]   his or her face and his or her body.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.620]   That person is really beautiful."
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.980]   That's related, however, to genetic health.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.980]   We can go more to that.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.460]   Let's say that somebody has beautiful skin.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:04.400]   Open up any advertisement for a skincare product and you'll see a model with beautiful skin.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:13.340]   Beautiful skin, clear skin, skin that is not encumbered by acne or other issues and I don't
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.460]   even know what words to say because I'm not knowledgeable enough.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.740]   But clear and beautiful skin, a healthy complexion, these are markers of good health.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:26.660]   If you see a sick person, if you see somebody that has boils or a rash or pustules of some
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:35.220]   kind or acne or white skin or a wand complexion or kind of greasiness or sliminess or something
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.840]   like that, these are expressions of sickness.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.660]   This is the way that sick people look.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:44.860]   So the beauty of someone's skin is related to health and most of it has to come from
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   inside.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.900]   And so if someone is constantly covering up, I think women are prone to this, someone's
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.500]   constantly covering up her skin, make sure you get a chance to see your skin au naturel
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.140]   rather than constantly covered with beauty products that may be concealing some expression
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.340]   of sickness.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:05.940]   If you are, let's say you're dealing with a sick and ailing actor or public person,
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:10.300]   maybe someone has been sick, a politician is sick and you've got to go on television
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:17.780]   to show how strong and competent he is, he's going to be spending a lot of time in front
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.300]   of the makeup artist before being put on TV.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.180]   And so makeup can be used to hide things and you should be filtering and saying is this
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.060]   person physically beautiful, have physical attraction.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.180]   Similarly, the way that somebody moves is an indication of health.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:40.140]   Somebody who's athletic, athleticism is related and correlated to health and balanced movement,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.500]   strong muscles, strong bones, functional joints, coordination.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:50.580]   Athletes generally are athletes because they're healthy and so you can screen for health based
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:56.700]   upon athleticism and expression of athleticism.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:03.980]   Back to family history, you should also think about the longevity that somebody has related
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.420]   to family history.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:10.000]   I always came from a long-lived parents and it wasn't until I was older I started doing
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.660]   financial counseling and I had clients who told me they didn't expect to live past 60
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.420]   and I never understood it because all my ancestors died at a hundred or at least in mid to late
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.880]   nineties and so the idea in my mind is always okay I'm going to live to a hundred, it's
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.540]   just how old we are.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:31.980]   And then I met people and I understood, wait a second, this person, like this is not, this
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.180]   was not me saying somehow well you're going to die soon.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:41.700]   This is an unbidden, unprompted expression that as to a man's financial planner that
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:46.420]   yeah I'm probably not going to live past 60 because in my family we all die in our fifties
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.420]   and sixties.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:55.540]   Think about the difference in wealth and expectations of life of marrying somebody whose family
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:00.460]   history would indicate that this person is unlikely to live past 60 as compared to someone
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.060]   who's likely to live to a hundred.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:08.460]   Think about the extra 20 or 30 decades of earning that perhaps a man who's likely lived
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.880]   to a hundred has over somebody who's likely to live to 50.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:18.060]   Think about your position as a wife who is marrying this man and think about him saying
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:22.380]   I'm not going to live past 60 so I'm going to retire at 45 and I'm going to start spending
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.620]   money because after all I want to spend money.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.060]   And he's going to die at 60 and you might be, you know, a woman coming in likely to
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.880]   die at 90 statistically speaking when you're going to live a lot longer than men.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.020]   So how do you plan for that financially as compared to a husband who expects to die at
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.740]   a hundred and he's going to work and earn income until he's say 80 and then he's going
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:47.620]   to retire for 10 or 15, 20 years and just the amount of money earned in a lifetime is
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:52.880]   enormous and also the long-term thinking that someone can have when he or she is investing
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.500]   say an extra decade of his life at an early age to have a high earning ability knowing
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.980]   that he has plenty of time to earn it out.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:05.160]   Think about your wife dying at 50 years old and now all of a sudden what do you do as
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   a man?
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.300]   Are you going to go and marry someone else?
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.140]   Are you going to be single for the rest of your life?
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.320]   That's really hard as compared to growing old with the wife of your youth and not having
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.820]   to worry about that and think about that.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:21.100]   So longevity of family history is something to think about and understand what it is.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:25.540]   Important to both of these though we shouldn't just focus on what is inherited because things
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.520]   that are inherited can be overcome.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:34.100]   So think about the propensity that your proposed marriage candidate has to correct health weaknesses.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:37.860]   All right well my parents all died of heart attacks but is this the kind of guy who is
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.680]   likely to say well my parents all died of heart attacks so I'm just going to never see
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.900]   a cardiologist or is this the kind of guy who says my parents all died of heart attacks
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.980]   so I'm going to be seeing a cardiologist every six months.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:55.180]   You understand the point that just because you may have gotten a bad genetic inheritance
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:00.460]   from your family doesn't mean that you're stuck with that bad genetic inheritance for
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.460]   life.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:06.280]   Is this person someone who's eating differently, exercising differently to develop the athletic
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.260]   ability to develop these things?
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:14.440]   Is this a person who's interested in topics that are related to health and longevity?
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:20.500]   No individual factor that I'm talking about should be seen as necessarily disqualifying.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:25.300]   There are only a few factors that I would say if one of my children came to me and said
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.580]   hey dad you know I'm considering this person as a husband or a wife, what do you think?
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:34.700]   There are only a few basic factors that I would say absolutely not.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:40.140]   On the other hand most of these are kind of a mushy gooey let's think about this and let's
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:45.540]   analyze all right here's a negative factor, you know here's a positive factor, this is
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.900]   highly correlated to success, this is highly correlated to failure.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:54.740]   Let's dig into these factors on a deeper level in order to understand how to respond to them
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.300]   and then each for each factor you look for the response.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:05.020]   So okay well this girl you know she's not the most beautiful and the reason for her
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:11.200]   beauty is ABC but you know what, she's adapted to that and she's figured out how to dress
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:17.180]   in a way that is really enhances her beauty and she has really dialed in on a lifestyle
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:24.360]   that leads to this being her incredibly robust health and man she's healthier than anyone
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.420]   I know even if she's not the most beautiful.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.580]   And that kind of girl would probably be much more attractive than the girl who's just quote
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:37.340]   unquote naturally beautiful, never worked for it, never tried for it, just automatically
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:42.620]   received it but yet shows no interest in maintaining her health, stuffing her face with bad food
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:50.380]   all the time, not enhancing what basic characteristics she has because we know that in 20 years the
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.660]   direction that that girl is on is going to be very different than the direction that
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:57:01.420]   the girl who didn't have the natural advantages and had to work to develop her advantages.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.460]   And so we're looking to see does this person have a propensity to correct health weaknesses,
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.180]   does this person have an interest in topics related to health and longevity but you need
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.460]   to screen for health because health is a big big deal.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.820]   Similarly big genetic trait to look for is going to be intelligence.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:24.660]   I think you need to seek a spouse who has a strong basis for intelligence, a strong
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:33.380]   genetic basis for intelligence and with someone with whom you share a similar level of intelligence.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:40.540]   I have a hard time being with the idea even of being married to somebody who is not my
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:45.540]   equal in terms of intelligence and intellectual ability.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:53.340]   That would be very unfulfilling and I think that people dramatically underestimate this.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:58.300]   Now I don't know how to solve basically the long-term cultural problem of homogamy in
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.860]   terms of separation among our classes, I don't know how to solve that.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.780]   All I know is that when you're going into marriage you want to be with somebody who
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.980]   is your intellectual equal, you want to be with somebody that you respect, you don't
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:16.180]   want to marry somebody who is dumb and he can't understand you.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:23.180]   Intelligence is highly correlated with earning potential, long-term career prospects, the
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:30.900]   ability to engage in wise financial decision-making, it's highly correlated with all of these
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:38.700]   things and with just long-term success and so if you are an intelligent man or intelligent
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:44.420]   woman you should be looking to marry an intelligent man or an intelligent woman and that will
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.340]   make everything easier.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:55.660]   I have a hard time knowing how, I don't interact very much with people of low intelligence
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:59:03.420]   and most of our societies result in the fact that most of us don't interact with people
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:08.300]   of differing intelligence from us because we kind of get funneled into schools, we get
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.540]   funneled into colleges, we get funneled into jobs and professions that are good equal for
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.540]   us.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:18.220]   Unless you have a business or the kind of profession that enables you to interact with
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:23.520]   people of differing intellectual ability, you just spend your time with people who are
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:28.300]   like you, we all do and people who can understand what you have to talk about because after
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.500]   all one of the basics of good human relationships is that you enjoy spending time with people
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.780]   who like to talk about the kinds of things you like to talk about.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:41.580]   And so I just didn't ever go out of my way, I never spent much time with people who were
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:47.620]   not very smart and as I got older I realized this accounts for a lot of the frustration
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:48.660]   that you have.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.540]   You try to explain something and I generally expect that if I'm going to, if someone's
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:58.300]   going to explain something to me I get one time and I better understand it and I take
[00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   the same thing the other way.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.140]   If I'm going to take my time to explain something to you, I'm going to explain it one time and
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   you need to get it.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:09.020]   Well, people who are not very smart don't generally function that way.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.500]   They need something to be explained multiple times.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:18.580]   That's enormously frustrating for me and I don't know when it was but my eyes were open
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:22.180]   a number of years ago and I realized, wait a second Joshua, sometimes you're judging
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:27.740]   people for character deficiencies and in reality that's an entirely wrong judgment.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:33.340]   Just understand that not all people have the same basic ability and we need to respect
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:39.300]   that and understand that and what happens is that we do a pretty decent job of this
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.060]   from the physical perspective.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:49.260]   If we see that someone is old or infirm or handicapped in some physical way then we automatically
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.860]   adapt and adjust to that person.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.160]   I'm going to walk a little slower, I'm going to offer you my arm, I'm going to do something
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.260]   to adapt and we do it with proper respect.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.900]   We don't look down on somebody because this person has a differing physical capacity than
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.060]   I do.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:08.900]   We don't look down on them, we just naturally adapt to one another and it's going to result
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:16.700]   in... our lives are going to result in segregation in some contexts.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.620]   If somebody is physically handicapped sitting in a wheelchair then he's going to be sitting
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:25.580]   on the side of the sports field while those who are not physically handicapped are playing
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.460]   on the sports field but that doesn't mean that there's not a place for that person in
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   society.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.820]   We're going to respect and appreciate that person, we're going to celebrate him for what
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:38.260]   he can do, for the things that he can contribute.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.780]   One of the great problems that we're facing in our society though is we don't know how
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.300]   to do that with intellectual ability.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.620]   We're sorting people and segregating people based upon intellectual ability but we don't
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.740]   know how to identify it, we don't know how to talk about it, we don't know how to esteem
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:59.640]   people for their ontological value that is not based upon intelligence while simultaneously
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.460]   segregating people for intelligence.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.500]   I don't have any solution to that, all I know is it matters.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.380]   So how do you screen for intelligence?
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:14.500]   Well I think academic ability is the most obvious useful screen that we have for that.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:19.640]   Academic ability and academic achievement is a useful proxy for IQ.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.000]   So you want to understand what kind of grades is the person... what kind of grades does
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.060]   someone that you're interested in marrying get when they were young and how far does
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.260]   this person's academic education go.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:38.480]   Now if the result of educational attainment is high, let's say that you are highly educated,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.540]   you have a master's degree, a PhD, a college degree of some kind, then almost certainly
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.660]   you're going to be attracted to people who are also highly educated.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:55.180]   If you are younger and let's say you're 20 years old and you are trying to assess somebody,
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:01.820]   you can't assess somebody based upon whether or not this person has a PhD, obviously, you
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.360]   know, you're 20 years old.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.660]   So then your filter is going to be based upon grades.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:13.180]   What kinds of grades does somebody get when young?
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:20.140]   People who do well in school are likely to do well in school and doing well in school
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:28.500]   is a useful and productive proxy that other people can use to measure intelligence, the
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   components of intelligence that relate to academic ability at least.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:38.700]   IQ is not the only important component of intelligence and if you dig into the IQ debates
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:46.940]   you can see that it seems like a useful metric that is able to be measured but not a complete
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:47.940]   metric.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:53.080]   So hopefully in a decade or a couple of decades we'll know how to deal with it but for now
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.060]   you should be generally attracted to somebody who gets grades kind of like you do and does
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:05.740]   well in school and that should be a component that you use to filter prospective marriage
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   candidates by.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:11.420]   Now in a moment I'm going to talk about the heritability of intelligence.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:15.260]   One of the challenges though is we need to be careful.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:22.500]   I think that your basic filter here should be how well does somebody do in school.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:28.980]   The filter should not necessarily be how many advanced degrees does a person have because
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:34.460]   there may be a negative effect to somebody having a lot of advanced degrees.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.520]   Remember earlier I tried to make the distinction I want to put in your mind there's a difference
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:46.280]   between marrying well and reproducing and marrying well you could have two academics
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:53.000]   right, two PhD holders that come together and they both have just this passionate academic
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.240]   career and he studies advanced I don't know cosmology and she studies advanced biological
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:09.080]   science and they can have the happiest most fulfilling marriage in the history of mankind.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.880]   Statistically they probably aren't going to reproduce very well, they're probably not
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.240]   going to have children.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.700]   If they do have children they're probably not going to have many children.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.680]   There's going to be some challenge here and the challenge is that in our current relatively
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:31.520]   antenatal age higher levels of educational achievement don't always correlate to having
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.160]   more children because of the investment into attaining higher levels of achievement.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.980]   This is different for men and for women but I think educational achievement and income
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.400]   need to be measured.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:51.300]   What we know is men who earn higher incomes, the higher a man's income goes the more children
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.480]   he tends to have.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.000]   Women who earn higher income, the higher her income goes the fewer children she tends to
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.280]   have.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.520]   That's not true when it's related to wealth.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:08.120]   So as I understand the data women who are wealthy or who earn income in forms other
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.000]   than wages they tend to have more children.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   But it's women who earn a lot of money don't tend to, in wages don't tend to have very
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   many children.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.060]   So this can be a real challenge.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:28.120]   Imagine that you are a man and you're trying to filter for a woman and you want to have
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:34.040]   a happy marriage where you have good compatibility between you and you also want to have five
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.160]   children.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:42.000]   Statistically if you marry a woman who is very invested into her academic career and
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.600]   she's pursuing a PhD and she's going to go and get a job she's not going to have many
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.900]   children.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.800]   Quite simply she's going to run out of time to have children.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:58.300]   So unless she is developing some kind of creative – sorry, she's going to run out of time
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.520]   to have children and she probably is going to be so devoted to her career that she's
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.200]   just not that interested in having children.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:11.080]   So unless we can figure out how to develop a new model for young women that allows them
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:17.240]   to maximize their educational accomplishments and career prospects while also allowing them
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:24.280]   to have children when they are young and have their children fit around their career then
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:28.840]   we need to be really careful here of what you're actually filtering for.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.600]   Because you marry a girl because she's got a PhD and a great career, well that's wonderful.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.480]   She's probably going to be phenomenally intelligent, hard-working, have enormous amounts of grit,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480]   perseverance.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.320]   Those are great traits that you would love your children to inherit and you're probably
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   not going to have many children.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:53.120]   So if we can filter and figure out how to help her to have children and express those
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.080]   traits in the future that's one of the things that we need to filter for.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.700]   So let's talk about transmission.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:07.120]   So your proxy, especially if you're a man, can't just be educational attainment.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.840]   It has to be something prior to that which is going to be grades and I'm just going
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.000]   to say educational potential.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.840]   Let's talk just for a moment about the transmission of intelligence to the next generation.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.920]   Back to Coming Apart by Charles Murray from his section on homogamy.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.120]   This section is entitled Transmission of Cognitive Ability to the Next Generation.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.920]   You're a podcast listener and this is a podcast ad.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.000]   Reach great listeners like yourself with podcast advertising from lips and ads.

[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.020]   Another consequence of increased educational and cognitive homogamy is the increased tenacity
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.960]   of the elite in maintaining its status across generations.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.000]   The adage "shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations" grew out of an observed
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.200]   reality.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   If the children and grandchildren are only average in their own abilities, money from
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.160]   a fortune won in the first generation won't keep them at the top of the heap.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.760]   When the parents are passing cognitive ability along with the money, the staying power of
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.480]   the elite across generations increases.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.200]   Specific numbers can be attached to such statements.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.560]   The stability of the average IQs for different levels of educational attainment over time
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.020]   means that we can predict the average IQs of children of parents with different combinations
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.440]   of education.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.040]   And we can also predict where the next generation of the smartest children is going to come
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.240]   from.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.440]   On average, children are neither as smart nor as dumb as their parents.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.220]   They are closer to the middle.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.800]   This tendency is called regression to the mean.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.660]   It exists independently of genes.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.440]   Regression to the mean is a function of the empirically observed statistical relationships
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.840]   between the tested IQs of parents and children.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.920]   Given the parameters in a previous note, the expected value of the IQ of a grown-up offspring
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.160]   is 40% toward the population mean from the parent's midpoint IQ.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.320]   Suppose we have four white couples with the same level of education.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.360]   Plugging in the average IQs for those levels of education as given in a previous table,
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.520]   I add a fifth couple who both have degrees from elite colleges with a midpoint IQ of
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.120]   135.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.200]   Here is what we can expect as mean IQs of the children of these couples.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.320]   So we have the parents' educations and the expected IQ of the child.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.760]   If the parents' educational level is that they are two high school dropouts, the expected
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.820]   IQ of the child is 94.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:44.960]   If parents' education is two high school diplomas, the expected IQ of the child is 101.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.680]   If parents have two college degrees and no more, the expected IQ of the child is 109.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:56.040]   If the parents' education is two graduate degrees, the expected IQ of the child is 116.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:02.640]   And then if the parents' education is two degrees from an elite college, the expected
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.860]   IQ of the child is 121.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.600]   These represent important differences in the resources that members of the next generation
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.520]   take to the preservation of their legacy.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.160]   Consider first a college graduate who marries a high school graduate, each with the average
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   cognitive ability for their educational level, 113 and 99 respectively.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.400]   Their expected midpoint IQ is 106.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.460]   Suppose they built a small business, been highly successful, and leave five million
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.140]   dollars to their son.
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:35.800]   If their son has the expected IQ of a little less than 105, he will have only about a 50%
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   chance of completing college, even assuming that he tries to go to college.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.320]   Maybe he inherited extraordinary energy and determination from his parents, which would
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.880]   help, but those qualities regress to the mean as well.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.800]   Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generation is a likely scenario for the progeny of that
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.840]   successful example.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.520]   Compare that situation with the one facing the son of two parents who both graduated
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.180]   from elite schools.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:03.800]   If he has exactly the expected IQ of 121, he has more than an 80% chance of getting
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.860]   a degree if he goes to college.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.520]   These percentages are not a matter of statistical theory.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.280]   They are based on the empirical experience of both the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.480]   Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.700]   If you had an IQ of 105 or one of 121 and entered college, those are the probabilities
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.060]   that you ever got a degree.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:28.400]   In addition to those differing chances of graduation are qualitative differences between
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.560]   young people with IQs of 105 and 121.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   First the reasons that someone with an IQ of 105 doesn't finish college probably include
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:42.240]   serious academic difficulties with the work, whereas the reasons a person with an IQ of
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.920]   121 doesn't finish college almost certainly involve motivation or self-discipline.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:53.360]   No one with an IQ of 121 has to drop out of college because he can't pass the courses.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.800]   Second there is a qualitative difference in the range of occupations open to those two
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.320]   young persons.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.560]   The one with an accurately measured IQ of 105 cannot expect to be successful in any
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.280]   of the prestigious professions that are screened for IQ by their educational requirements,
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.560]   for example medicine, law, engineering, and academia.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.400]   It is unlikely that he can even complete those educational requirements.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.040]   Someone with an accurately measured IQ of 121 can succeed in any of them if his mathematical
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.260]   and verbal talents are both strong or succeed in the ones geared to his talents if there
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:29.840]   is an imbalance between mathematical and verbal ability.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.040]   Now think in terms of an entire cohort of children.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.240]   Where will the next generation of children with exceptional cognitive ability come from?
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.840]   For purposes of illustration let's say that exceptionally high cognitive ability means
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:46.700]   the top five centiles of the next generation of white children.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:50.360]   More than a quarter of their parents may be expected to have a midpoint IQ of more than
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.120]   125.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.280]   Another quarter may be expected to have midpoint parental IQ of 117 to 125.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:02.760]   The third quarter may be expected to have midpoint parental IQ of 108 to 117.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.640]   That leaves one quarter who will be the children of parents with midpoint parental IQ of less
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.400]   than 108.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.640]   Only about 14% of that top five centiles of children are expected to come from the entire
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.520]   bottom half of the distribution of white parents.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:23.480]   Therein lies the explanation for that startling statistic I reported earlier about SAT scores.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:29.860]   In 2010 87% of the students with 700 plus scores in critical reading or mathematics
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:35.400]   had a parent with a college degree and 57% had a parent with a graduate degree.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.040]   Those percentages could have been predicted pretty closely just by knowing the facts about
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.800]   the IQs associated with different educational levels and the correlation between parental
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.360]   and child IQ.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.780]   They could have been predicted without making any theoretical assumptions about the roles
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.560]   of nature and nurture in transmitting cognitive ability and without knowing anything about
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.280]   the family incomes of those SAT test takers, how many test preparation courses their children
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.520]   took, whether they went to private schools or how ingenious the educational toys in the
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.200]   household were when they were toddlers.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.120]   In an age when the majority of parents in the top five centiles of cognitive ability
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.840]   worked as farmers, shopkeepers, blue-collar workers, and housewives, a situation that
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.160]   necessarily prevailed a century ago given the occupational and educational distributions
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.120]   during the early 1900s, these relationships between the cognitive ability of parents and
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.640]   children had no ominous implications.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.960]   Today, when the exceptionally qualified have been so efficiently drawn into the ranks of
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.000]   the upper middle class and where they are so often married to people with the same ability
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.040]   and background, they do.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.840]   In fact, the implications are even more ominous than I just described because none of the
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.600]   numbers I used to illustrate the transmission of cognitive ability to the next generation
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.760]   incorporated the effects of the increased educational homogamy of recent decades.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.000]   In any case, the bottom line is not subject to refutation.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.160]   Highly disproportionate numbers of exceptionally able children in the next generation will
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.200]   come from parents in the upper middle class and more specifically from parents who are
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.880]   already part of the broad elite.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.600]   I want you to understand that intelligence is inherited and so you want to marry the
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.160]   most intelligent person that you can because you want your children to be smart, because
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:27.840]   intelligence makes everything easier in life, and so you want to marry the most intelligent
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.600]   person that you're able to.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.920]   If you want your wealth to continue through the generations and you want to break that
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.280]   shirt-sleeves-to-shirt-sleeves problem, you clearly see that you need to account for intelligence.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:48.120]   You want to marry the kind of person who is intelligent as best you're able to attract.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.760]   Here's my message loud and clear.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.400]   Let me pause for just a moment so you'll listen.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:06.200]   Your future wife, who is intelligent, is almost certainly going to be enrolled in college.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.720]   Right now, we have an enormous social problem brewing.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   It's already here.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.360]   The big – there's many problems.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.400]   I don't know how to solve – by the way, I don't know how to solve the social issues
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   just described in what I have read.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.040]   All I know is that for you as an individual, if you want to be wealthy, you want to marry
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.480]   a wealthy – excuse me.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.320]   If you want to be wealthy, you want to marry an intelligent spouse and you want your children
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   to be intelligent.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.640]   So I don't know how to solve the social mixing problem.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.240]   We'll figure out some solutions to it.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.360]   I don't have any today.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.800]   What I know is that you need to marry somebody who is smart.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:46.080]   But men, right now, girls and women are going to college at a rate that is – I think it's
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.400]   like two-thirds female and one-third male.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.880]   There is a strong movement of men to go away from college.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.120]   Some of these reasons are valid.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.080]   Some of these reasons are less valid.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.440]   College probably has been broadly oversold to many people.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.520]   The financial impact of college has resulted in more people going to college than should
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.680]   go to college.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.600]   I don't know how to solve all these issues.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.280]   But men and young women – this is a problem – sorry, it's both.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   Men and women are facing enormous problems.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:34.720]   A lot of men right now are bitter about how many women have been funneled into the college
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.160]   pipeline.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:42.520]   Women are handed constant and never-ending encouragement in our society that men never
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.800]   receive.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:48.280]   And the underperformance of men in the current age is something that we've got to take seriously
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.840]   if we're going to save our civilization.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.440]   Women receive constant affirmation and men receive almost constant confrontation.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:07.160]   The school environment, starting in elementary school, is mostly toxic to men.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.360]   It's very highly favored in favor of women.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.680]   Everything in our society is structured around "you go, girl, you go, girl," and almost
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.400]   all of it is anti-male.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.880]   As the father of four sons, I pay a lot of attention to this.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.480]   I don't know how to solve all of those things, and I don't want to necessarily go down the
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.920]   rabbit trail of trying to figure out today what's right and what's wrong.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.400]   Maybe everything was wrong with our previous civilization.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   Maybe our previous civilization was just cruel to women and froze them out of everything
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.040]   and imposed enormous ceilings on them, maybe.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.400]   But in the wake of feminism, we've become very anti-male, and our boys are failing to
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.640]   thrive.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:59.160]   One expression of that is that many of them are not going to college.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:05.600]   And so maybe it was a bad thing that 100% of previous college attendees were men, and
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.120]   then it was 80%.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.640]   Maybe that was a bad thing and it had to be corrected.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.200]   But what we currently see in the current data is that 50% isn't working.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.880]   So now it's gone lopsided in the other direction.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.360]   And what is happening as a result of this?
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.440]   Well, women are generally desiring to have a relationship with men who are their equal
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.980]   or superior.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.640]   Women tend to be more hypergamous than men are.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.360]   They want to marry a man who is in a better station in life than they are, someone who's
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:39.240]   more successful, more sophisticated, more intelligent, more accomplished, whereas men
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.280]   don't have the same preference.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.120]   Men want to marry a woman who makes them feel good, who gives them peace in their life,
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.640]   who compliments them, gives skills and things like that.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:51.620]   Men don't go around wanting to marry women who are their superiors and who are better
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.120]   than them in some metric.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.840]   It causes men to be frustrated and feel frustrated with their lives.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:03.920]   So what is happening, though, is that so many women now are not able to find what they perceive
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.080]   to be high-quality marriage candidates.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.420]   And so they're all competing desperately for this tiny cohort of college-age men.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:17.040]   Most of them are having polygynous relationships with men, whether they know it or not.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:21.320]   If you look at the data, it's clearly polygynous relationships, and in many cases they know
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   it.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.200]   And the extent of this is that they're not marrying, and so then those men that are in
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:35.680]   college are often—I don't want to go beyond what I can prove from the data, so I'll just
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.440]   pause and rather than say any more, it's a real problem.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.900]   So for men, just recognize, though, that in this basically birth-to-college pipeline that
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:51.740]   most girls grow up in, if you are going to marry an intelligent woman, it's almost unthinkable
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.880]   to see why she wouldn't have a college degree or be enrolled in college.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:03.280]   Our culture is pushing, pushing, pushing girls and young women to college at enormous rates.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.160]   It supports them left, right, and center.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.600]   It encourages them that you have to do this.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   You have to do this.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.880]   It pours money into them, pours all kinds of special advantageous programs for them.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.340]   And so as a man, there's a decent chance that if you're a young man, you're pretty annoyed
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:23.000]   about that, because you didn't get any of that.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.640]   Nobody pushed you in that direction.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.720]   You didn't get any of the money.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.840]   You didn't get any of the support.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.480]   You didn't get any of the extra tutoring, whatever.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   Suck it up.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   Life's not fair.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.520]   The point is that if you're going to marry an intelligent woman, she's almost certainly
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.160]   going to be in college.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.400]   In order for her not to be in college or not to have a college degree of some kind, she
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:48.520]   would have to be incredibly iconoclastic, incredibly anti-trend, et cetera.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.560]   And that's just not a normal female trait.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:59.760]   It's believable to think that a very highly educated, highly qualified, intelligent woman
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.520]   could find a man who just was so smart that he saw the stupidity of the college sorting
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]   mechanism.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.640]   And he went out and he started – he's a high school dropout, but he started five businesses
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.040]   and he's got $10 million in net worth by the time he's 21 years old.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.280]   And she could pick him, target him, attract him, seduce him, marry him, boom.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.720]   That's entirely believable.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.160]   Because we know that happens significantly.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.400]   There are a lot of men who do that.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:33.620]   Men are much more likely to be that kind of anti-authoritarian kind of guy.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.160]   It doesn't work the other way.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.120]   And so if you're a man and you're looking for a wife, almost certainly the best place
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.060]   to be looking is on a college campus.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.680]   If you are remotely close in age to the kinds of women that you would find on a college
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.120]   campus.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.760]   And I find this discussion incredibly funny and ironic.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.160]   I believe that what I've described, though I have used more words than I would like,
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.480]   is absolutely logically true.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.360]   But I find it ironic because years ago, not only would I have made fun of – when I was
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.520]   in college, I would have made fun of the idea that a useful reason to go to college is to
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.200]   find a wife or a husband.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.400]   We all made fun of it because it was the MRS degree.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.360]   And so men made fun of women for going to college to meet a husband.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.080]   I never make fun of anyone today who has a strategy to land a husband or a wife.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.520]   I never make fun of them because I've seen how those girls who have a strategy to land
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.600]   a husband, they get married and I wish them all the best.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:38.720]   I don't make fun of anybody today for having a strategy to attract a high-quality spouse.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.560]   What I find ironic and funny is that I now think that the tables have turned, that the
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.280]   women who go to college are going to have a hard time finding a husband in many cases,
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:58.920]   and that now going to college is going to be a reliable – a good reason for going
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:06.020]   to college is to find a great wife, and that going to college is going to be a more reliable
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:12.040]   way for a motivated young man who wants a wife to find and attract – to find, filter
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:18.720]   and attract her than many other types of strategies.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.280]   And so I've counseled this repeatedly to young men who are of college age.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:27.260]   If you are intelligent, for most intelligent people, academics are pretty easy.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.560]   The only reason academics are not easy is because you get tired of them.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.560]   So take a break or two, but if you're 25 years old and you've got a bachelor's degree,
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:40.280]   go get a master's degree because you're going to find it easier to be in contact with
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:48.880]   a lot of young women who are good candidates for marriage because that's where they're
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.680]   all been sorted into.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:56.660]   And it's a perfectly reasonable, valid strategy that people don't appreciate to the degree
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:59.120]   that they ought to appreciate.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.040]   Now for young women who are in college, I would say that I think there's probably still
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.760]   a competitive strategy that if you're trying to attract a man that you meet in college,
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:17.880]   I think that there are competitive strategies that you could employ to express femininity
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:23.240]   that would help you to attract a man, especially a man who is likely to be a good husband.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.520]   One of the ironic things about the feminist revolution is that what today we refer to
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.500]   as feminism I think could equally be called masculinism.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:38.160]   What I mean is simply that almost every trait that you'll hear a feminist talking about,
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:45.080]   about wanting to encourage in young girls and women, is actually a trait that men traditionally
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.080]   have.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.960]   And it's not that feminists want to be more feminine and express their woman-ness to a
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.560]   stronger degree.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.140]   On the contrary, feminists want to be less feminine and express their inner masculinity
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.820]   to a stronger degree.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:08.720]   And so most feminist women tend to wind up looking and sounding a lot like men than like
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:09.720]   women.
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:15.600]   I think a good strategy for young women who are fighting, finding themselves in environments
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.220]   where they're fighting for a small pool of men to employ, is reject feminism and lean
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.160]   into femininity.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:29.120]   So reject trying to be like a man and instead embrace being truly feminine.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:37.700]   And I think that this kind of expression of femininity is your magic formula to attract
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.200]   a very high quality man.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.940]   Because you will wind up creating for him the kind of environment that he is likely
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:50.420]   to really resonate with, regardless of whether he can explain it or not.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:57.320]   And this doesn't in any degree mean that you have to sacrifice your intellectual ability,
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.000]   your academic ability, those kinds of things.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.660]   Those things are important.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:06.300]   And a smart man wants to marry a smart woman.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:12.020]   But putting it crudely to make the point so that it will stick in your mind, imagine that
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:22.100]   you are a 20-year-old young lady and you're in college and you want to attract a really
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.980]   high quality husband.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:30.500]   Let's assume that your plan is to become a medical doctor or to get a PhD in neuroscience.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.600]   And what I'm trying to demonstrate is that you're a woman of ambition.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:42.820]   You're a woman of ability and you have high ambitions for your intellect, for your career,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:44.920]   things like that.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.080]   If you dye your hair blue, if you chop all your hair off, dye your hair blue and go parading
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.580]   around in the streets at the next political march holding a cardboard sign, the chances
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.100]   of your being single five years from now are very, very high.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:06.780]   On the other hand, if you grow your hair long, put on a cute sundress and learn how to cook
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:12.580]   amazing food, the chances of your being married to a doctor five years from now are very,
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.540]   very high.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:22.340]   There is no difference whatsoever in your fundamental academic ability, career ambition,
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.400]   intelligence.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.980]   There's no difference as to how serious a man will take you and respect you.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:34.100]   A high quality husband is likely to appreciate and respect your intelligence.
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:36.020]   He's looking for those things.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.480]   But there is an enormous difference in your attractiveness based upon how you express
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.180]   your femininity.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.940]   So please, if you care about this stuff, don't be a feminist.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.460]   Be feminine.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:58.820]   And men are not looking for weak, stupid women who just happen to be hot.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:03.360]   Men are looking for strong – the kind of man that you want to be married to are looking
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:11.180]   for strong, confident, intelligent women who are women.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:14.660]   I hope that helps someone who's younger.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.400]   Consider that college is an important strategy.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.220]   So so far, genetic traits that we have to look for, I've talked about good health
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.220]   and longevity.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.220]   I've talked about intelligence.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.400]   I'm going to move a little faster because these other ones are important but they're
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.460]   more obvious and they're less easily measured.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:32.300]   We don't necessarily have as much data.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:37.440]   The next trait I think you want to look for that is probably genetic is the trait of resilience
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.880]   or what today we would probably call grit.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.860]   Grit is a characteristic that we resonate with.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.020]   We know it's important.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:51.780]   And it's a characteristic that's increasingly being measured in the social science.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.960]   It seems to be at least somewhat genetic.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:06.300]   Marrying someone who is resilient and expresses strong stick-to-itiveness or strong grit means
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.860]   that you would be married to somebody who is able to overcome the challenges that life
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.180]   is going to throw at you.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:21.220]   All of us face enormous setbacks and our ability to persevere through tough times is usually
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.240]   the key that leads to long-term success.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:27.500]   If you study millionaires, what you see is that it's very common for millionaires to
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.980]   go bankrupt at least a couple of times on their pathway to success.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.240]   It's very common for people to be laid off from work.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.960]   Very common for people to lose their businesses, to lose their livelihoods.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.240]   Many successful people face these things.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.600]   The difference between somebody though who becomes a millionaire or a multi-millionaire
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:50.600]   has much more to do with his ability to dust off the failure and get up and keep going.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:56.000]   A guy who goes bankrupt and rolls over and sits in the corner and sucks his thumb or
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.680]   says I'm depressed, I can't go on with my life just because I'm so depressed and sits
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.880]   around and whines about his condition in life is not likely to be wealthy.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.400]   But the guy who dusts himself off says that sucked, I don't want to do that again and
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.500]   goes after it again is the guy who's likely to be wealthy.
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:14.680]   What you see as you get older is you see that so much of long-term success in anything,
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:21.420]   in learning, in academics, in business success, in marriage, in everything in life has more
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:25.880]   to do with your ability to get knocked down and get up and try again than it does to do
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:30.240]   with the actual impact of getting knocked down or what it says about you.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.680]   Everyone gets knocked down.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.440]   And so grit seems to be from what I can figure out to be at least somewhat genetic.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:41.320]   I read one paper and let me just read you the initial abstract from it just so you get
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:49.040]   an idea that there's some people that are trying to understand this and find academic
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:58.360]   evidence for the heritability or non-heritability of a trait like grit.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.480]   I'm reading here from a British publication.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:07.400]   The paper is called "True Grit and Genetics, Predicting Academic Achievement from Personality"
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.640]   by four authors, Rimfield, Kovas, Dale and Plumman.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:12.640]   Here's the abstract.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:18.160]   "Grit, perseverance and passion for long-term goals has been shown to be a significant predictor
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:23.200]   of academic success, even after controlling for other personality factors.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:28.760]   Here for the first time, we use a UK representative sample and a genetically sensitive design
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:34.080]   to unpack the etiology of grit and its prediction of academic achievement in comparison to well-established
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.760]   personality traits.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:44.560]   For 4,642 16-year-olds, 2,321 twin pairs, we use the GRIT-S scale, perseverance of effort
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.480]   and consistency of interest, along with the big five personality traits to predict scores
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.760]   on the General Certificate of Secondary Education, GCSE exams, which are administered UK-wide
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.320]   at the end of compulsory education.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:04.760]   Twin analyses of grit perseverance yielded a heritability estimate of 37%, 20% for consistency
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:09.000]   of interest and no evidence for shared environmental influence."
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.240]   I repeat, "Heritability estimate of 37% and no evidence for shared environmental influence.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.920]   Personality, primarily conscientiousness, predicts about 6% of the variance in GCSE
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.040]   scores, but grit adds little to this prediction.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:29.680]   Moreover, multivariate twin analyses showed that roughly two-thirds of the GCSE prediction
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.800]   is mediated genetically.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.960]   Grit perseverance of effort and big five conscientiousness are to a large extent the same trait, both
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:42.640]   phenotypically, R equals 0.53, and genetically, genetic correlation equals 0.86.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.680]   We conclude that the etiology of grit is highly similar to other personality traits, not only
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.240]   in showing substantial genetic influence, but also in showing no influence of shared
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.500]   environmental factors.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.480]   Personality significantly predicts academic achievement, but grit adds little, phenotypically
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.000]   or genetically, to the prediction of academic achievement beyond traditional personality
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.860]   factors, especially conscientiousness."
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:12.320]   So you see that basically there is -- grit seems to be at least somewhat heritable.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.680]   So I think that, more importantly, this is something that we know makes a difference.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.680]   So you're going to marry.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:24.020]   You're going to, again, use my example, you're going to marry a man who flunks out of school.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.160]   Do you want that man to get up and keep going or do you want him to curl up in the corner
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.700]   and suck his thumb?
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:32.520]   And if you're a man, think of what your wife wants.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.520]   Let's say that you're a man and you're marrying a woman and she gets a demotion at work.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.220]   Do you want her to curl up and whine and cry into her bottle of wine about how hard life
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.160]   is and how it's so entirely unfair or do you want her to say, "All right, well, I'll have
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.200]   to work harder next time"?
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.280]   Lack of grit is just flat-out annoying, if nothing else.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.080]   You don't want to live with somebody who does this.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:00.480]   And remember that you're going to be facing the challenge of supporting this person emotionally.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.720]   And so one of the most valuable aspects that we get from marriage is emotional support.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:12.700]   If I face a difficulty in my life, I want to be able to go home and cry on my wife's
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:18.700]   shoulder and for her to let me cry for a few minutes and then the next day say, "All right,
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:19.700]   get out there.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.140]   I believe in you."
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.660]   And yet she can only do that so many times.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:28.660]   It's fine for me to go and have a good cry one time, but if I turn into a blubbering
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.500]   mess and I do that a second time and a third time and a fifth time, it's going to be tough
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.140]   for her to continue that.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:38.540]   Similarly, as a husband, if my wife faces difficulties, I'm going to be there for her.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.100]   I'm going to be there to support her.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:44.660]   I'm going to be there to build her up and hold her while she cries and say, "It's okay,
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:45.660]   girl.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:46.660]   Let it go."
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.500]   And on the second day, all right, I'm going to do it.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.900]   But on the third day, come on, suck it up.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:51.900]   Life is tough.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:56.460]   And so that's going to be super, super annoying if you're an achiever.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:03.380]   And so this expression of grit, I think, gets at what we're looking for, is that we want
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:07.420]   to be married to somebody who's not going to just drag us down all the time into an
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:09.180]   emotional morass.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.860]   And once you're married, now you've got to figure out how to build this person up.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:16.180]   And marrying somebody who's emotionally handicapped and can't deal with setbacks in life is no
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.320]   formula for a happy life.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.420]   So on what basis would you judge the grit that somebody is displaying in his or her
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.420]   life?
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:31.380]   I don't have as useful or as convenient of a proxy as I do for the previous one.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:37.860]   So for health, we can use beauty and attractiveness and athletic ability as pretty decent markers
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:42.300]   for health, especially if you bring in family history and longevity of parents and grandparents
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.580]   as well.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:50.260]   For intelligence, we can use academic ability and grades in academia as a pretty decent
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.260]   proxy for intelligence.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:54.220]   How do you judge grit?
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.300]   I don't have a decent of a proxy.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:01.420]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to read to you a list of basically characteristics
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.460]   that are associated with grit.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.580]   And I think these are things that you want to look for.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.140]   So first, persistence in the face of challenges.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.260]   You want to ask yourself, does this person that I'm interested in marrying demonstrate,
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:19.100]   has he or she demonstrated persistence in the face of challenges?
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:26.060]   Does this person demonstrate consistency and commitment, perseverance in pursuit of passion,
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:34.260]   resilience in adversity, the ability to delay gratification, effortful engagement, goal
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:40.860]   clarity and direction, seeking and embracing challenges, adaptability and learning from
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:45.300]   failure, and then long-term drive towards achievement and success.
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.860]   All of these are components of grit.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:57.300]   So look for activities in which your potential spouse has faced disaster and failure and
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:02.460]   been overwhelmed and overcome, and then try to figure out what happened next.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:10.420]   If those things aren't there, then I would say try to negotiate some kind of circumstance
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:13.900]   in which you could test for grit in some way.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.820]   I'll get to that in a moment when I talk about testing for basically social intelligence
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:25.020]   and emotional stability that we want to just consider, does this person demonstrate grit?
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.980]   Next, drive and ambition.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:34.620]   I think you want to seek a partner who demonstrates drive and ambition because there does seem
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:41.140]   to be a genetic component to drive and ambition, and they put our finger on something that
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.340]   just drives somebody.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:47.180]   Now I don't know whether it's all genetic on a physical basis or whether it's more of
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:52.380]   what I'm going to get to in a moment of long-term environmental influence, but if you're married
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.840]   to a motivated spouse, then your marriage is more likely to have more opportunities
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.900]   for wealth creation and financial growth.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:07.700]   Generally women seem to be much more attuned to this than men because I think women naturally
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:13.300]   sense their vulnerability if they marry a man who is of low ambition.
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:20.620]   A woman, a high-quality, motivated, ambitious woman will, I can't even conceive of a woman
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.580]   like that being married to a man of low ambition.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:28.780]   Low ambition is an enormous turnoff for women, and again I think this is right, I think it
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:29.780]   should be.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:36.420]   What I always notice is, especially with regard to bearing children, I notice how vulnerable
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.100]   what my wife is when she has children.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:46.460]   It puts her in an enormous vulnerable place that if she couldn't trust me and know that
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:49.500]   I'm going to keep pressing forward, then it would be very difficult for her.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.700]   It would bring an enormous emotional instability to her.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.060]   So how do you filter for that?
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:59.020]   Well if she's going to marry one young, she's not going to filter for a man who is rich,
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:03.860]   doesn't have time to be rich, or earns a lot of money even, doesn't have time to earn a
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:05.940]   lot of money, just getting started in his career.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.660]   So the filter is drive and ambition.
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:14.140]   Now men I don't think filter so much for this, but I think we should.
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:19.060]   Here's the problem with the filter, is that when I say drive and ambition, we're so indoctrinated
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:25.260]   into automatically thinking of that in a career perspective, that it causes us to ignore other
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.700]   expressions of drive and ambition.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:34.660]   I'm not necessarily interested, as a primary thing, of marrying a woman who has huge career
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.540]   drive and ambition.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:41.860]   I don't think that's a disqualifying factor, although in some cases it would be.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:46.460]   If a man wants to have children, and if his wife is so driven to make a difference in
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.940]   a career that's going to require her to be a non-stop partner at her law firm, and she's
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.940]   just never ever going to be willing to have children because of the cost of her career,
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:00.020]   then that is a disqualifying factor for a man who wants to have children.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:02.780]   Remember again, I said marriage as compared to having children.
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:06.100]   Two components that are related, but not synonymous.
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:13.420]   So I don't think that career ambition is necessarily a disqualifying factor, except in its extreme
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.420]   form.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:21.020]   But what I observe is that I think career ambition can often, is a useful proxy, but
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.500]   it's not a complete proxy.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:32.220]   I've known many women who had no specific career ambition of, "I really want to, again,
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:38.260]   get a PhD and get, I really wanted to win a Nobel Prize in physics," who had enormous
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.420]   drive and ambition on the domestic front.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:45.900]   They really wanted to build a family and change the world with their family.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:51.060]   Or on a cultural front, "We really need to change this community.
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.380]   We really need to adjust this political issue."
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.300]   And as I talked about on a recent Q&A with a young lady who was thinking about the pros
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.500]   and cons of becoming a mother and staying a stay-at-home mother versus otherwise, what
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:10.940]   I observe is that in our entirely career-focused, income-generating-focused society, as we've
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:17.420]   pushed all drive and ambition in that direction and said that it all has to be financially
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:23.580]   related, we've eliminated a lot of drive and ambition from a lot of our communities.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:29.660]   And our parks are disgusting, and our roads are destroying the vitality of town life.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:37.740]   And because we've centered everyone of drive and ambition into a focus of earning lots
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:38.980]   of money.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:40.900]   This does apply equally to men and to women.
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:45.100]   I think that in many cases, a woman will be attracted to a man who has great drive and
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.020]   ambition, but his goal is not to make money.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.860]   His goal is to make a difference.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.700]   His goal is to change his community.
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:54.220]   His goal is to save the lost.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.080]   His goal is to green the desert.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:02.320]   And so drive and ambition are important components, and they will be correlated with financial
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:05.180]   pursuit, but not synonymous for it.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:10.020]   Now, I think a good proxy for filtering for drive and ambition, since we can't predict
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:13.900]   all of the expressions of it, I think is growth mindset.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.700]   So this is a term that we increasingly hear about.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.360]   Carol Dweck, of course, famously pioneered it.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:23.480]   What I think growth mindset is a core component of what I would look for, what I look for
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:30.060]   in a healthy marriage, and what I think most people should, is that, is this person committed
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.820]   to learning and growing and changing at every stage?
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:38.440]   People who don't have a growth mindset, I think, are going to just be bad spouses, because
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.080]   they're not likely to put away the things that they had before and embrace something
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.120]   new.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.080]   And the whole growth of being married and having children is that you're going to have
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.520]   to grow and change, and there's going to be new skills required.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.560]   I need to develop new skills as a husband, my wife needs to develop new skills as a wife,
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:01.340]   we need to develop new skills as father and mother, we need to develop new skills as grandfather
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:05.880]   and grandmother in the fullness of time, as uncle and aunt, as community members.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.960]   And so what you're looking for is growth mindset.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.840]   So I don't have a great way to do that, but I think that you should always be listening
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:18.520]   and filtering based upon, is the person that I'm attracted to demonstrating his or her
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:25.080]   ability to grow and to change, to set aside things that were perhaps useful before and
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.520]   commit himself to a growth mindset?
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:31.280]   Is he willing to say, you know what, I don't think what I used to believe, I'm willing
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.860]   to change my perspective, I'm willing to change my opinions, and I think this is a good expression
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.440]   of drive and ambition.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:44.800]   And we should filter drive and ambition not exclusively based upon earning ability, but
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:51.800]   broadly bring it in as a basic human component and see its expression in other ways.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:58.120]   I really appreciate that my wife has demonstrated growth mindset and has demonstrated drive
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.440]   and ambition towards my children.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.400]   That makes me much, much more satisfied with her as a good wife than if she hadn't done
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.200]   that over the last 10 years.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.500]   I believe that if she were asked, she would say the same thing about me, is that I've
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:17.960]   grown in my ambition towards my children over the years.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:24.160]   So my drive and ambition is not exclusively represented in a money-earning aspect, but
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.200]   it's a core part of what I see as my overall growth mindset.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.400]   The next characteristic is social intelligence.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:41.440]   Here what I think we really want to filter for is sociopaths and people who just clearly,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.340]   genetically or whatever, who are not capable.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:50.200]   If you can marry a spouse who has strong social intelligence and has strong representation
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.240]   of traits like empathy and has good communication skills and shows that he or she can build
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.600]   and maintain relationships, then I think you're on the fast track to success.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.480]   Intelligently intelligent individuals are good at networking and negotiation and collaboration.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.800]   These are all core components not only of a good marriage, but just to good business
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.520]   success, good financial success, to career advancement and business partnerships and
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.600]   finding wealth and investment opportunities.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:28.360]   Social ability and social or emotional intelligence and social intelligence is core, and so we
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.120]   need to filter for that.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.440]   Don't marry somebody, especially don't ever marry or be in a relationship with someone
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.680]   who's a psychopath or has the negative stuff, doesn't treat you well, doesn't respect you,
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.980]   doesn't appreciate you, doesn't express those things verbally and in action.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.940]   Filter out all the negative stuff, but then filter for people who express these things
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:48.480]   on a high degree.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:54.460]   So I think some proxies, again imperfect, but does this person I'm interested in, does
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.400]   he or she demonstrate care for others?
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:00.820]   Are social situations smooth and easily navigated?
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:04.960]   Does he or she respect other people and demonstrate that respect?
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:11.040]   When I was thinking about this in preparation for the show, I thought of some of the aphorisms
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.920]   that I think are true and worth paying attention to.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.960]   So one I like is how you do anything is how you do everything.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:18.560]   How you do anything is how you do everything.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.760]   It's not literally true, but it's metaphorically true that generally people who are good at
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.360]   business are probably going to be devoted to their marriage in many cases and by devoted
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.540]   to their business meaning because devotion is a feature that applies broadly.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:37.880]   Someone who's devoted to his marriage is probably going to be likely to be devoted to his health.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.960]   How you do anything is how you do everything.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.320]   But in a social dimension, things like this, well if she'll cheat with you, then she'll
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.680]   cheat on you.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.880]   There's an aphorism there.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.000]   I think it's true.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.920]   People who cheat on their partner to be with you are probably likely to cheat on you to
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.600]   be with someone else that comes along who's better than you.
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:03.440]   I always like things that are especially related to our appreciation of social elite such as
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:09.360]   judging a successful man or woman by how he or she treats servants or people who are not
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.200]   in the social class that he comes from.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:19.080]   I find that the way that people treat people who can't do anything for them is a pretty
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.120]   decent way to understand how they're going to treat you.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:26.800]   There are people who only treat other people as something they can get and there are people
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.040]   who just genuinely treat everyone with respect and appreciation.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.040]   And sometimes, you know, we all appreciate the stories about how the president of the
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:41.280]   country or the CEO of the business comes in and is always careful of the staff and of
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:44.600]   his servants and treats everyone with respect.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:52.680]   So look at the person and don't be in a relationship with somebody who treats other people poorly.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:59.200]   If a man will belittle other people to you, then he'll belittle you to other people.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.640]   Or if a woman will belittle other people, then she will belittle you once she has you.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.840]   Now marriage is not as enduring as it once was, but frequently there's – I think it
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.340]   used to be that there was more of a disparity between how people acted to land a husband
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.320]   or land a wife and how they acted after they landed the husband or wife.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.120]   But the point remains that if someone's going to talk poorly about other people to
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:31.000]   you or gossip about other people to you, then be careful because he or she is likely to
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.200]   betray your trust and your intimacy to other people.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:41.760]   One note, there is a difference between things that are gossip and things that are private.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:51.000]   It's not always wrong to speak about something that is private in a trusted relationship.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.280]   I may be having a marriage problem and I may go to a trusted friend or trusted advisor
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:01.600]   and in confidence share about this particular problem that I'm having and I may even expose
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:06.040]   intimate personal details, private details to this person.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:11.200]   However, I don't go and ever gossip about and just kind of say, "Oh, let me just tell
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.760]   you all the bad things and bad mouth my wife."
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760]   I would never do that.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:20.900]   And so be careful because you're not going to generally know what other people are saying
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:27.240]   about you to other people, but you can judge how people speak, how he or she is likely
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:32.840]   to speak about you to other people based upon how he or she speaks about other people with
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840]   you.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:39.360]   In the intimacy of a close relationship, you will speak about private affairs.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.980]   I may speak about someone else's private affairs with my wife in the confidence and intimacy
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:53.240]   of a close relationship, but I would never and must never gossip or be frivolous or insulting
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.880]   about other people.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.160]   If I'm going to speak about someone else's private affairs, it should only be done because
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:06.120]   of care and love for another person and a desire to genuinely help or explore something
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.480]   with my intimate spouse.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:13.520]   Similarly, if someone's going to bad mouth others, if he's going to bad mouth others
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.360]   to you, he'll bad mouth you to other people.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.820]   These things are congruent.
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:22.260]   People of high social intelligence are congruent.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:29.920]   They behave consistently among classes, among situations, in public, in a private, they're
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.920]   congruent.
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:31.920]   There may be exceptions.
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.200]   We all have moments of weakness, moments of frustration, anger, but there is going to
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.200]   be a high degree of congruence.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:45.320]   So don't think that somehow this person who is socially stupid and toxic is going to just
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.200]   magically turn into a great spouse.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:48.200]   Nope!
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.200]   He's not.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200]   She's not.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:53.160]   And then related to having moments, emotional stability.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:59.320]   I think that you want to seek a partner who has a strong predisposition, which I think
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.840]   there's probably some genetic component towards it, but a strong predisposition towards emotional
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.080]   stability and resilience.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:14.840]   Emotional stability helps people to navigate stress and uncertainty and interpersonal conflicts
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.080]   and to do these things effectively.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:22.880]   It builds good relationships and it reduces the likelihood of impulsive financial decisions
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.600]   driven by emotional turbulence.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:33.240]   People who go out and do retail therapy, avoid like the plague someone who does that.
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:36.160]   Don't do that.
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:41.620]   Somebody who thinks that going out and spending money frivolously is a substitute for a healthy
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:45.080]   activity is not going to treat your finances well.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.480]   You can apply a little bit of judgment.
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.320]   If she calls at retail therapy and goes shopping with her best friend for five hours and buys
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:57.080]   a $5 latte and a $20 item that was 50% discounted, okay great.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.800]   But if she calls it retail therapy and goes out and comes back with stacks and stacks
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.240]   of designer brands, don't marry this woman.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.120]   You're doomed if you do.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.680]   You want to choose somebody who is emotionally stable.
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:13.120]   Now I don't have a great proxy for this.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:17.920]   I've considered, I've been learning about the big five personality test and it was alluded
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:24.560]   to in the abstract that I read, but I don't know what the great proxy is for emotional
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:25.560]   stability.
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.080]   I'd have to wait until one of you psychologists listeners can tell me what it is.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:35.160]   My only thought is that you should observe the person you're interested in through times
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.840]   of emotional extremes.
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.440]   Is this man or is this woman emotionally, generally emotionally stable?
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:49.760]   I think there are a couple of things that should be generally obvious that are necessary
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.200]   of a productive courtship relationship.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.560]   Let me explain for just a moment.
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.760]   Traditionally in our Western tradition, and I'll bring the recent tradition into it, we've
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:08.000]   generally brought in a phased approach to relationships.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.040]   What are the phases of relationships?
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:17.280]   Generally a relationship would go quickly from acquaintance or knowledge of one another
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.320]   or friendship to courtship.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.720]   In the past 50 years we added a phase of relationship called dating.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:30.440]   So in the world that I grew up in, which is different from today's world, in the world
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.760]   that I grew up in you would have an acquaintance or a friendship, then you would move from
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:41.400]   an acquaintance relationship or a friendship relationship to a dating relationship and
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:50.560]   then a dating relationship was generally considered to be some form of committed monogamous relationship
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:57.320]   that in the healthiest of cases had marriage as a potential outcome, a potential positive
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.120]   outcome, but there was not a commitment to marriage yet.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.480]   It was boyfriend/girlfriend exploring the relationship, exploring one another, getting
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:11.360]   to know one another with an idea that this would lead to marriage in the fullness of
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:12.360]   time.
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.560]   Then you would go from a dating relationship to an engagement and usually of course dating
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:24.100]   would involve some more obvious expression of courtship, so you would have that engagement.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.840]   Engagement was a time in which you were publicly committed to be married and in a time of public
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:35.640]   commitment to be married, then you were exploring compatibility, engaging in marital counseling,
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.840]   premarital counseling, exploring things and you were heading towards marriage.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.400]   Then there was marriage and marriage was the final point, the final time.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.400]   Now we're in it.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.680]   We're in it for life, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, sickness and health,
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.280]   no matter what, we're in it till death do us part.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.520]   That was the culture that I grew up in and before.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:08.120]   Today most of those clear stages of relationship seem to have collapsed for most people who
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:10.520]   aren't coming from a strong subculture.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:15.800]   By strong subculture I mean a strong religious community with clearly defined stages of relationship,
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:18.840]   a strong family community with clear expectations.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.360]   Just speaking broadly in the general culture, it seems to me that young men and women who
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.480]   are interested in each other are navigating a morass of undefined relationships.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:32.840]   You can be dating, but dating doesn't necessarily mean monogamy.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.240]   You can be having sex with someone, but it's just a situationship.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.600]   It's not a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.200]   You can be – I mean basically about the only cultural rule that seems to be still
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.520]   somewhat valid is engagement, that okay, we're engaged.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:54.000]   But then the problem with engagement is that engagement can last for a very long time and
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.680]   couples who aren't engaged are shacked up together for years and years and years and
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.040]   there may or may not lead to marriage.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.440]   It's just enormously confusing.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.960]   On the whole, this is enormously destructive.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.200]   It's destructive for men, it's destructive for women, and it's causing young men and
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:12.640]   women to lose out on some of the best, most important years of their life to filter for
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.600]   a potential relationship.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:24.320]   It's enormously, especially I think where it really happens is men are, generally speaking,
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:29.960]   harming young women by engaging in things that either are a relationship or could be
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:34.400]   called a relationship without a plan to move that relationship to marriage.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.480]   There's a saying that I think is probably broadly true that women control access to
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:42.540]   sex and men control access to relationships.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:48.440]   What has happened is in our current world, we have very high levels of sexual promiscuity
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:54.260]   and it seems to me that women have broadly lowered their demands, lowered the bar for
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.840]   access to sex.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:01.420]   That seems that many young women have been trained or decided to give men free and easy
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.440]   access to sex with almost no strings attached.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:15.580]   The quaint "put a ring on it" idea has broadly disappeared from much of popular culture.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:21.460]   Men – I don't know whether they've lowered the bar on access to relationships but men
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:28.440]   have seemingly largely figured out that they can get whatever they want to get without
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.940]   ever having to provide a relationship.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.060]   I consider this to be harmful.
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:38.580]   It's harmful to the men but it's very harmful for the women because women, in many cases,
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:45.320]   are giving their best, most fruitful, productive years to men who turn out to never actually
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:50.620]   have an ambition to a marriage and long-term relationship.
[01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:56.860]   So let's assume for the sake of argument that you see some problems with the current situation.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.820]   There can be a great temptation to say, "Well, we're just getting rid of all of that.
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:01.900]   Let's just go to marriage as fast as possible.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:04.920]   Let's just marry off our 18-year-olds and have 18-day engagements."
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:08.140]   No, that's also wrong.
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.140]   The flip side is not to be gone after.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:17.140]   While you probably know, as I do, some people who met each other and just instantly fell
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.420]   in love, instantly knew they were forever and six weeks later they're married and their
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.260]   marriage has endured for 16 years.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.820]   You probably know someone like that.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:32.020]   Those people do not make the rule and we should not look to them as the rule.
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:37.500]   On the contrary, we need to think and say, "Why do we have stages of relationship?
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.820]   What are we looking for?"
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:42.980]   Well, things like emotional stability need to be sussed out.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:48.900]   You need to know someone for long enough to be able to judge, "Is this person emotionally
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:54.700]   stable?" which means that you need to be in relationship for a significant amount of
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:01:02.140]   time in order to judge through a period of intense emotional height and intense emotional
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:03.140]   lows.
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:07.900]   It'd be really great if you could see someone that you're considering married get kicked
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:13.420]   in the teeth by life and go through something really difficult as well as be put on stage
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:15.460]   and have 15 minutes of fame.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:21.200]   That would be fantastic because then you could judge how does this person respond in times
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.540]   of great distress and times of great jubilation.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:27.500]   That's useful.
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.580]   That's why we have stages of relationship in a culture.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.940]   That's why you have a courtship culture.
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:40.080]   The best way to observe somebody from afar is probably as a friend and so it's really
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:47.580]   healthy for young men and women to have friendships, broad numerous friendships with the opposite
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:52.580]   sex where there are friend interactions so you can see how people handle things.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:57.540]   It's really wonderful if you have been able to be friends with somebody for a long enough
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:04.900]   period of time to observe him or her go through triumphs and defeats so that you can see how
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:07.220]   does this person handle those things.
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:10.860]   The problem with friendships is that a lot of times friendships don't move out into the
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:17.660]   romantic zone and you wind up getting friend zoned if you're a guy, similar men can't – I
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:21.340]   don't think men can be friends with women.
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:25.380]   Men are friends with women because they're hoping to get with women in some time.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:29.660]   I know that's unpopular to say but I don't see the alternative ever being true.
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:30.820]   It's not true in my experience.
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:35.220]   I don't know any men who are genuinely friends with women on the long term who are not interested
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:37.120]   in a long term relationship.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:38.500]   At least past a certain age.
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:44.340]   I think an exception could be that when you're put together possibly in a social dynamic,
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:47.500]   you're in school together, you have just a natural reason to be together.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:51.020]   You can be very friendly and be friends with women in that context.
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:55.620]   But when your friendship becomes something that happens outside of the social dynamic,
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:03:00.540]   I don't see how men and women can be friends on an ongoing basis.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.860]   The example I would use would just be this.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:10.580]   As a married man, I enjoy friendships and interactions with women who are not my wife.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:16.740]   But those interactions always happen in the context of a social environment in which the
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:23.620]   woman's husband is present or my wife is present and thus we have a group social environment.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:28.740]   The reason for getting together is not so that I can go and see my friend, the woman
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:29.920]   who is not my wife.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.520]   On the contrary, we're getting together as a group and in that group I can enjoy friendships
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:42.120]   and relationships and conversation and dialogue and debate with a woman who is not my wife.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:49.200]   But the context has to be a group social environment and the woman's husband has to be part of
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.200]   it.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.440]   So I am friends with women in the context of a group social environment.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:58.320]   What I would never do is I would never be friends with a woman who is married to someone
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:02.480]   other man and say, "Hey, let's you and I go out to lunch together because we're friends."
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:10.360]   I would never do that because, and she wouldn't either, because there's not a friendship that
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:15.200]   can work outside of the group social environment.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.540]   So if we look at young people, what you see is that friendships between young men and
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:27.640]   young women or boys and girls, these are very productive when there's a reason to be involved
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.080]   in the group dynamic.
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:34.760]   Going to school together, doing a play together, going on a trip, things like that where you
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.120]   get to know people in that environment, those are really good opportunities and they're
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.040]   genuine useful friendships where you care about the person.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:50.040]   But when that friendship starts to go in the direction of spending individual time together
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:56.360]   outside of the context of the reason you came together and on a one-on-one basis, it's not
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:00.040]   possible for that to stay as just a friendship.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:05.320]   The girl that was my friend in a group dynamic and then I started going out on a one-on-one
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.640]   basis as friends ultimately became my wife.
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.600]   So there's my experience with it.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:20.040]   So the point being that if you have the opportunity to observe your potential spouse in a group
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.600]   dynamic, then that's really great because there's less emotional ties.
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:26.280]   This person's not putting on airs for you.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:32.880]   You can judge emotional stability and social intelligence in that context.
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:37.640]   But that's not generally always a great pathway to marriage.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:41.080]   You don't want to wind up just in the friend zone if you're looking for marriage.
[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:44.000]   And so that's why dating exists.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.680]   That's why we created the idea of dating to say there's a romantic attraction here.
[02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:53.880]   We're not just being friends and we're trying to spend some time in a relationship where
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.960]   we're not committed to marriage, but we're spending time in a relationship to where we
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:59.800]   can observe one another.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:05.200]   One of the enormous problems of dating, however, comes if dating becomes a sexual relationship
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.280]   absent marriage.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.360]   Sex complicates everything.
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:14.360]   It dials everything, every emotional involvement, every emotional engagement up to an absolute
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.800]   maximum.
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:18.480]   Sex is not emotionally neutral.
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:23.280]   It affects the relationship very, very deeply and it affects the interactions between a
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:25.040]   man and a woman.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:31.600]   And so if you have a dating relationship where people are spending time together, and it
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:34.720]   can be in a group setting, it can be an individual component.
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:40.840]   If you can keep sex out of the relationship, you can have a much more objective observation
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:47.000]   of an individual for a continued period of time to be able to observe how is this person
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.640]   handling life.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:57.640]   Sex is best introduced in the context of a publicly acknowledged clear commitment that
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:07:04.520]   eliminates all of the uncertainty involving matters of consent, matters of respect, matters
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:08.600]   of just everything related to it.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.000]   And so that's why we have marriage.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.880]   And so these phases of the relationship, my point is not to harangue you about sex, but
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:19.400]   to say that these phases of relationship are really important.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:24.240]   And that dating and courtship, relationship leading to marriage, this is important because
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:31.440]   it gives a man and woman opportunity to observe one another and to have a romantic context
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.720]   that's different than friendship.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:42.600]   But yet to not yet complicate matters with the heart, the emotions, the hormones, everything
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:47.240]   related to an intense sexual relationship.
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:51.040]   Then when you move to courtship, that's where you can, sorry, when you move to engagement,
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.920]   that's where you can get genuinely intimate.
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:08:01.400]   It's not safe to share the deepest desires of your heart, the deepest ambitions that
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:08.320]   you have without a publicly acknowledged commitment.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:14.480]   I would never go if I weren't married, I would never go and share the deepest desires and
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:18.280]   the deepest thoughts that I have and the biggest conflicts and the controversies and things
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:22.440]   like that with a woman where I had no public commitment of relationship.
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:30.680]   And so engagement is designed to allow a couple to be safe enough to share with one another
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:36.400]   the most intimate secrets that they have because there is public commitment.
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:44.560]   But they do that sharing in the context in which it can still be terminated without excessive
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.560]   harm.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:46.560]   I don't want to say without harm.
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.000]   Terminating an engagement is not easy, but it's without excessive harm.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:58.960]   Terminating a relationship in which you have both emotional intimacy and physical intimacy
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:03.040]   is potentially life-destroying.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:10.560]   It comes with enormous cost and so this gradation of relationships allows a couple to observe
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:19.280]   one another in various scenarios and environments, but yet to have the ability to end it without
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.360]   the heart-wrenching emotional and physical intensity that happens if they are fully engaged
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.720]   and if the relationship has been sexually consummated.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:32.840]   That's reserved for marriage, which as we'll talk about in a moment, sees a couple through
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:36.360]   for the long term because the commitment carries you through the emotional instability.
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.640]   Now back to emotional stability.
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:44.280]   I don't have a great proxy for this, but what you want is enough time to observe the person
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:46.600]   through times of emotional extremes.
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.480]   Is this person stable?
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:55.040]   And then I think an intelligent person, an intelligent man or woman would seek to create
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:10:02.080]   external influences that are likely to demonstrate emotional stability or instability.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:04.880]   Let me give an analogy first.
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.840]   When you're learning to shoot a gun, if you're in the military, first thing you do is you
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:13.400]   learn to stand at the firing line and you learn to shoot the gun and you shoot, shoot,
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.760]   shoot, shoot, shoot.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:17.680]   Shooting a gun while standing at a firing line on a firing range is pretty easy.
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:20.320]   It doesn't require much.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.680]   How do you simulate combat?
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:27.680]   Well, you can't simulate combat very effectively with troops safely if there's actually a risk
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:30.680]   of this person being injured.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:35.760]   While some elite training and some training of your may actually have a live fire exercise
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.140]   where you could get killed while you're going under the barbed wire, generally no intelligent
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:46.880]   military commander is simulating combat in a scenario in which you are going to create
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.880]   the risk of death.
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:52.500]   You don't kill your soldiers by training if you can possibly avoid it.
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:53.500]   So what do they do?
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:58.700]   They find something else that simulates the basic conditions of combat.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:02.180]   And in firearms training, that's something like exercise.
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:07.820]   And so what they'll do is to practice your marksmanship skills.
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:13.860]   You start with just cool, calm, collected, putting in your shots, then you start running
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:14.860]   20 yards.
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:18.140]   So you sprint 20 yards down, sprint 20 yards back.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:22.760]   Now your chest is heaving, your adrenaline's pumping, your body's all just going crazy.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.620]   Now you got to shoot accurately with the adrenaline pumping.
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:29.980]   And that's analogous to a condition that you'll be in in combat.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:33.420]   Similarly, a trainer will introduce other forms of stress.
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:34.420]   They'll introduce light.
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:35.740]   They'll introduce loud noises.
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:39.420]   They'll put a megaphone up your ear and yell at you and insult you and criticize you and
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:43.580]   tell you you're ugly and shoot off flashbangs all around you.
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:50.140]   And so the stress that you simulate in training is designed to cause the same physical reactions
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:52.700]   that you're going to experience in other times of life.
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:56.480]   To see how you respond and to learn mechanisms for responding to them.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.480]   So what I would suggest to you that if you want to test emotional stability in someone
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.220]   that you're not married to, you need to have a period of time to observe the person in
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:06.040]   varying conditions.
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.000]   And it would be smart for you to introduce variability into that.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.880]   Let's imagine that all of your dates with your prospective spouse are just lovely dates
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.520]   where we go out to eat together and we're just happy and we walk around and we hold
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:23.400]   hands and we talk and share and whatnot.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:27.520]   Well, your date is putting on makeup every single time.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.760]   He's putting on his best suit.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.560]   You're constantly in nothing but idyllic circumstances.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:32.560]   That's great.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:33.560]   That's fun.
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:36.720]   It's also not a great test of emotional stability.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.720]   What is a great test of emotional stability?
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.040]   Well, let's go out and let's take a long hike where we get hot, tired, and thirsty and see
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:46.920]   how do we do when we're hot, tired, and thirsty.
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:52.320]   Let's go and get ourselves involved in some intense emotional situation where all of a
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.120]   sudden the emotions are high.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.120]   It could be exercise.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.120]   It could be a game.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.280]   How does this person respond in these environments?
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.560]   And you go ahead and put your creativity to play.
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:06.720]   But I think that if you have the ability, you want to see your prospective spouse tested
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.880]   in a variety of situations, not just, "Hey, that's great.
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:12.420]   This guy can walk up to the firing line and shoot a pistol."
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:20.380]   You want to insert uncertainty into the training mechanism so that there is a good evidence
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:23.380]   of long-term stability.
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:27.920]   This concludes the genetic traits that I think we should be looking for.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:32.020]   And I want to move now to long-term family traits.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:37.660]   So what I mean here is not things that can be changed quickly, but what are the cultural
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:43.020]   conditions, the environmental factors that somebody has been exposed to that are likely
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:52.800]   to have a deep and enduring influence on this person to relate to how he or she is going
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:57.380]   to work in the long term, and especially with a focus on how will this affect the financial
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:59.900]   outcomes of my marriage.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:03.740]   So I don't think these are things that are physically genetic, but they're environmental,
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.460]   but they're not easily changed.
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:10.220]   I think one of the first ones, especially in the context of divorce proofing, remember
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.220]   that second factor.
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:12.220]   There's three factors.
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:18.100]   Factor number one is short and long-term financial income growth and basically ability to grow
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:19.100]   wealth.
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:24.780]   The second is expenses, high expense lifestyle, the highest expense lifestyle being divorce.
[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:28.200]   And then the third factor is just long-term benefits for my children.
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.020]   Those are kind of my three organizing principles here.
[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:37.780]   So what are these factors then that are long-term and there's going to be a significant amount
[02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:41.420]   of divorce proofing here that needs to be talked about.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:47.140]   First one is the durability of marriage among parents and grandparents and extended family.
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:52.260]   Durability of marriage is an important metric to measure because it's the thing that you
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:56.300]   can see objectively that is not related to what someone says.
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.340]   It's related to what someone does.
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:01.980]   And it's something that you have to observe today because there's probably going to be
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:06.700]   a great discrepancy between what someone says and what someone does.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.580]   If I understand the research right now, but again, I would cite here Brad Wilcox's recent
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.340]   book on marriage.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:18.220]   But what he alleges in his, what he asserts in his book is that the data demonstrates
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:27.780]   that the elite among us, socially elite, are very likely to say anything goes.
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:30.780]   A social elite is very likely to say, "Hey, you do you.
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:31.940]   You live how you want to live.
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:32.940]   Marry who you want to marry.
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:34.380]   Love who you want to love.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:35.380]   You do you.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:36.740]   You just do whatever you want."
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:42.620]   But from a behavior perspective or from a cultural perspective, someone who is part
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:49.220]   of the current social elite is very likely to have very high standards of actual behavior.
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:51.580]   And so you're going to get married and you're going to stay married.
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:54.180]   You're going to marry someone that's appropriately suited to you.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:56.580]   You're not going to marry a wacko.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:02.220]   There's a strong family and social pressure for these things.
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:05.560]   Now that's different than other classes.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.300]   So although other classes are also likely now in today's world to say, "Hey, you do
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:10.300]   you.
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:11.860]   You know, do whatever you live, how you want to live."
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:12.860]   And then they follow through on it.
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:16.740]   There's also people that profess to have standards like, "Oh, you've got to live this certain
[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.740]   way."
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:19.460]   But in reality, their life doesn't match up to that.
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:20.460]   So what can you do?
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:26.260]   Well, I think you could judge someone by the durability of marriage among a person's parents
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:29.860]   or grandparents, siblings, extended family around.
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:33.700]   Is this person surrounded by long enduring marriages?
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:38.500]   Now this is not necessarily a purely disqualifying criteria.
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:43.860]   We know that people whose parents are married in long-term marriages with no divorce, they
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:47.440]   are statistically more likely to stay in marriages themselves.
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:49.180]   But there are the flip side as well.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:51.440]   It's not necessarily disqualifying.
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:55.420]   But I think what you're really – meaning that parents divorce – if this person's
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:58.700]   parents are divorced, it's not, "Okay, that, out, done."
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:02.440]   But what you're looking for is to really understand the reasons.
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:08.180]   Because somebody's propensity to marry and divorce is very much going to be judged – is
[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:10.980]   likely to be related to good decision-making.
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:17.140]   Is this person surrounded by people who make good decisions, focusing on the long-term,
[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:22.060]   focusing on what's best for the group, focusing on what's best for the children, for the tribe?
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:24.660]   Or is it all about short-term gratification?
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:25.700]   What's best for me?
[02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:27.260]   How do I feel at the moment?
[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:28.980]   What makes me happy?
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:33.580]   Is there a culture where bad decision-makers are just, "Oh, it's no big deal.
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:34.580]   So and so."
[02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:39.380]   "Oh, she was with this guy and she had another guy because she felt happy because she was
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:42.180]   with him because he just gave her the tickles."
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:47.340]   Or is there a culture where bad decision-makers are ostracized and shunned, or are they just
[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.460]   accepted and it's no big deal?
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:54.680]   Is there a family pressure towards being smart, making good decisions, going to college, choosing
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:59.060]   your friend group carefully, and maintaining enduring relationships?
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:04.220]   Here's my current working theory on durability of marriage relationships.
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:11.220]   I'm guessing that there's about 20% of people in society who are just naturally inclined
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:17.380]   to easily enter into marriage relationships, have them last forever, no problems whatsoever.
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:19.140]   They never even struggle and try.
[02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:20.900]   It's just easy for them.
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:25.660]   I'm also guessing that there's probably 20% of people in society who are so hopelessly
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:31.380]   socially incompetent that they probably have no ability to ever form a long-term enduring
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:37.420]   relationship and it's just hopeless.
[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:38.820]   They're never going to make it.
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.580]   So I'm guessing that there's those two extremes.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:48.580]   What I care a lot about, though, is the middle 60%, because I think the middle 60% is where
[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:51.780]   we need strong social pressure.
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:56.660]   And marriage is one of those things where that strong social pressure really, really
[02:18:56.660 --> 02:18:57.780]   helps.
[02:18:57.780 --> 02:19:02.300]   And formerly, it seems like we had that culture, broadly speaking.
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:06.020]   As a culture, we shunned and ostracized those who were divorced.
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:09.840]   We shunned and ostracized people who were unfaithful to their spouses.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:13.300]   We shunned and ostracized people who made bad decisions.
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:17.660]   And clearly, that culture looked and said, "Hey, wait.
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:18.660]   This is bad.
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:19.900]   This is painful."
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:22.380]   That was why we invented no-fault divorce.
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:26.580]   They said, "Well, we just, you know, people have irreconcilable differences and we just
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.580]   have to end this."
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:29.940]   Again, but I would say those are probably that bottom 20%.
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:35.300]   But what we've created in the wake of it is we've created a world in which there's not
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:40.020]   much support to get couples through the hard times.
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:46.420]   And hard times are as normal and as expected in marriage as they are in business or in
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:50.900]   school or in athletics or in any other domain of life.
[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:57.820]   And so the top 20% have the grit to just naturally get themselves through the hard times just
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:59.780]   with their own courage.
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:03.020]   They face enormous difficulties and they just press through automatically because that's
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:04.420]   who I am.
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:07.480]   But in athletics, what we do is we coach that middle 60%.
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:08.480]   We say, "You can do it."
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:12.200]   In academics, we say, "If you fail, we're going to coach that middle 60%."
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:15.700]   And in life and in business, we coach that middle 60%.
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:17.940]   We say, "Dust yourself off but stick with the plan.
[02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:19.220]   Stick with the vision."
[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:21.780]   But in marriage, we don't coach that.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:25.300]   We've created a culture in which instead of coaching that, we just automatically throw
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:27.840]   in the towel and we say, "No problem."
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:32.700]   And so it seems to me that we need to have that strong social pressure to keep the middle
[02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:35.320]   60% of marriages together.
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:41.220]   Now that pressure used to be legal and that was why no-fault divorce was such a disaster.
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:45.860]   Used to be understood that if I marry you and you marry me, if I don't commit adultery
[02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:51.100]   against you, I don't abandon you, I don't abuse you, that you got to stay married to
[02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:52.100]   me.
[02:20:52.100 --> 02:20:55.320]   And that was the social contract and that kept people going in when they were excited
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:00.260]   and it kept it through them when they were unexcited and it provided and protected both
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.260]   people.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:02.260]   It protected men and women.
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:08.940]   And as I said recently, marriage is a contract between a man and a woman where they put in
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:11.540]   differing amounts at different times.
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:16.340]   If a couple marries young, the woman puts in her youth, her sexual attractiveness, her
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:20.940]   childbearing ability, her willingness to raise children when she's young and beautiful and
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:23.120]   every man in the world wants to be with her.
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:27.620]   And the man, and she chooses a man who has not yet achieved his potential.
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:33.820]   When she's older though, the man is high income earning, has things to offer her, has stability,
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:37.380]   has confidence, has all these things that he probably didn't have when he was younger
[02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:39.700]   and he still sees that through.
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:44.780]   And so now though, what we've done is we've destroyed that social pressure and we have
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:51.600]   pulled it apart so that men and women don't have, but they don't have the pressure.
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:58.340]   So the woman may invest into the relationship, her beauty, her fecundity, her years of raising
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:03.020]   children, then all of a sudden she's 40 years old and the man can toss her aside just because
[02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:04.780]   he feels like it.
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:09.140]   Or if the man comes along at an older age and he's wealthy and sophisticated and attractive
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:13.980]   and he marries a wonderful attractive woman, then she can just toss him aside because she
[02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:20.140]   wants half his money in divorce court with no moral error on his part.
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:21.860]   And so we need that social pressure.
[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.780]   Now I don't think we're going to get any legal social pressure, at least in the United States
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:25.780]   anytime soon.
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:27.100]   So what makes up for it?
[02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:32.020]   Well, it's got to be a family culture, it's got to be a religious culture, there's got
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:37.620]   to be pressure there that is going to be brought to bear to keep that middle 60% of marriages
[02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:43.340]   really strong and flourishing and give the highest possible nature of it.
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:49.380]   And so there's got to be pressure that if I marry this woman and we have a big fight
[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:54.500]   and she goes home crying to mama and she's telling mommy, "Oh, he said all these things
[02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:58.580]   mean things," and whatnot, you want to have the confidence to know that her mother is
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:03.020]   going to say, "All right, honey, cry, cry, cry, now go back and see your husband."
[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:06.860]   Not that her mother is going to say to her, "Oh, honey, maybe you'd be better off with
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:08.260]   someone else."
[02:23:08.260 --> 02:23:10.000]   You got to have the confidence that.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.620]   You got to have the confidence that if you're going to marry this man and you're going to
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:17.860]   turn 30, then he's going to go to his dad and he's going to say, "You know what?
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:21.860]   She didn't lose that last 10 pounds after having our third baby, maybe I should trade
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:22.860]   her in."
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.540]   You want to have the confidence that his dad's going to look him in the face and pull out
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:29.740]   a belt and say, "You idiot, don't ever let me hear you say something like that again."
[02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:35.880]   Not, "Well, after all, maybe you could go and find another young sexy something or other."
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:43.820]   I'm using garish stereotypes to try to demonstrate the point that you want to be marrying into
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:49.180]   a culture that's going to promote your marriage and so you need to look for those long-term
[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:53.460]   family traits in order to divorce proof your relationship.
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:56.540]   What about the quality of relationships?
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:24:00.540]   I think you should look very carefully, what is the quality of parents' and grandparents'
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:02.260]   marriage relationships?
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:05.740]   I think in general, the natural inclination is the husbands are probably going to treat
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:11.160]   their wives about how they watch their fathers treat their mothers, at least to start with.
[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:14.740]   If you're a woman and you're looking at a man, you should go and look and see how does
[02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:19.140]   his father treat his mother and observe and say, "Do I like that?"
[02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:22.580]   I think wives in general are probably going to treat their husbands about how they watch
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:25.820]   their mothers treat their fathers, at least to start with.
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:29.380]   If you're a man who's interested in a woman, go and spend some time watching how does her
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.100]   mother treat her father.
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:35.420]   Do you like that and do you want this person to treat you the way that you observe?
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:41.260]   If you see problems in that, not necessarily disqualifying, but does your prospective spouse
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:46.260]   also see those problems and does your spouse have a desire to change?
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:49.940]   Think about these things from the quality and durability of relationship.
[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:55.020]   I think you should look carefully at what is the family history of financial success.
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:01.060]   I don't believe that financial success is a matter of genetic history, at least not
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:07.620]   currently, but I think that if you consider your potential spouse's history of financial
[02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:13.460]   success, it can provide insights into genetic and cultural predispositions toward wealth
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:14.460]   accumulation.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:16.740]   What are you looking for?
[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:21.340]   Responsible financial management, long-term thinking, people who have a strong locus of
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:25.860]   control, recognize that they're in charge of their situation rather than other people.
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:28.100]   Look for a history of entrepreneurial endeavors.
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:34.860]   Look for a high appreciation of academics and an honoring of people who are skilled
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:36.620]   and highly educated.
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:38.720]   Look for generational wealth.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:44.820]   These all are related to cultural factors that are likely to lead to your family being
[02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:47.940]   a prodigious accumulator of wealth.
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:53.500]   On a very practical level, it all comes down to what's going to be the encouragement if
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:55.780]   you say I want to start a business?
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.660]   What are her parents going to say?
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:00.860]   Are they going to say absolutely you should start a business and let us be your first
[02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:05.460]   customer or are they going to say oh I think that's risky, you probably shouldn't.
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:09.380]   What if you say I'm learning about investing, do you have any tips for me?
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:11.380]   You don't want to sit around and talk about sports ball.
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:13.580]   You want a family that's going to talk about investing.
[02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:19.340]   You want a family where money is honored and appreciated and focused on as a topic of conversation.
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:24.660]   It would be much easier for you to be successful in business, to be a successful investor,
[02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:29.660]   to be successful in financial management, if you had a family culture in which you're
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:36.220]   lauded for your wise decisions and your frugality and your conscientiousness rather than where
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:38.700]   you're made fun of for those factors.
[02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:43.500]   And so recognize that the family history of financial success is going to be a big factor
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:50.040]   on you and it's going to be a factor on even just the nature of your relationship.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:55.300]   If you're a man and you grew up and you're considering a woman who watched her father
[02:26:55.300 --> 02:27:02.700]   grow up working long hard hours and saw him struggle when he was young but now sees him
[02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:08.080]   as wealthy and accomplished and able to enjoy the fruit of his labors, she's going to really
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:15.820]   appreciate your long hard work much more than if she just never had any exposure to that
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.460]   and she's whining, "What's five o'clock?
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.460]   You need to be here."
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:22.700]   No, she understands that you're going to need to make a sacrifice to be successful
[02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:23.980]   in business.
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:29.140]   Conversely, let's say that your wife, your potential wife grew up watching a man who
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:36.300]   was just a lazy jerk and her whole life he just was a total loser.
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.000]   And so you don't want to be a loser.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.420]   You want to make something of yourself but what if she doesn't expect you to make something
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:43.760]   of yourself?
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.520]   She doesn't think that's likely to be worth it.
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:47.520]   She's not going to push you.
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:48.720]   She's not going to encourage you.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:52.400]   She's just going to assume, "Well, the man I'm married to is likely to be a lump just
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.400]   like my dad."
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:54.400]   You don't want that.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.020]   You want a wife who's going to push you, who's going to encourage you, who's going to – if
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:02.500]   you're sitting around because you got laid off, you don't want a woman who's going to
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:06.340]   say, "Well, honey, why don't you just sit around on the house and the couch and mope?"
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:11.700]   You want a woman who says, "Get out the door and go find a job and here's a kick in the
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:12.700]   butt."
[02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:16.100]   That's what you're looking for is a woman who will drive you and push you on and a lot
[02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:18.860]   of that is going to be driven by what she observed.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:26.380]   Let's say that you are interested in a woman whose father treated her mother very poorly,
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:32.020]   who committed adultery against her or who constantly didn't see to her needs, didn't
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:35.300]   see to her luxuries, never had enough money for anything.
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:39.220]   Well, now all of a sudden, there's a good chance that your wife is not going to be able
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:43.100]   to trust you and your willingness to provide for her and your ability.
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:46.020]   She's going to feel like, "I've always got to have my own reserve set aside.
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:47.020]   I can't trust him.
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.980]   I've got to make sure that I make money."
[02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:53.260]   All this stuff goes very deep is the point and so you want to look and see what is the
[02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:59.220]   family history related to finance and how is that going to impact our financial culture.
[02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:04.620]   What you're looking for is a culture of financial prudence and wise decision making.
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:09.440]   It's not about the actual dollar figures involved necessarily.
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.860]   That certainly helps.
[02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:16.420]   If you can marry a man whose dad earned, you know, eight figures instead of five figures,
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:19.940]   do it because there's a decent chance that the man that you're going to marry is more
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:22.260]   likely to earn eight figures instead of five figures.
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.340]   Go for it.
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:25.480]   But it's not so much about the dollar figures.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:30.260]   It's more about how are decisions made.
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:35.100]   You can have somebody that you're interested in who's driving a very expensive car.
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.580]   Maybe it's a really high-end Mercedes.
[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:43.320]   That really high-end Mercedes can represent every last bit of money that this person can
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:48.720]   scrape together out of his monthly budget to buy on payments, to pay the lease payment.
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:54.180]   Or it can represent just a completely negligible amount of financial wealth for the family
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:57.760]   and we just drive nice cars because it's a nice car and it doesn't even matter.
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:01.060]   So you can't judge it based upon the dollar figures of consumption.
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:06.460]   What you need to judge it based upon is what kind of consumption is rewarded and what kind
[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:08.580]   of consumption is made fun of.
[02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:13.020]   In a wealthy family, if somebody goes out and buys in a truly wealthy family, not an
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:16.420]   aspirational, not someone who's trying to lie their way into wealth, somebody goes out
[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:22.980]   and buys a really high-end car and can't afford easily to buy it five times over with a tiny
[02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:26.460]   percentage of this year's profit portfolio, the wealthy family is going to make fun of
[02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:27.460]   that guy.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:28.460]   What are you doing?
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:29.460]   You're stupid.
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:30.460]   You don't do that.
[02:30:30.460 --> 02:30:33.060]   You don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.040]   You nurture the goose and you only spend the eggs.
[02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:40.980]   So a wealthy family is going to make fun of somebody who makes a dumb financial decision
[02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:48.860]   and you're going to feel a strong desire to make a smart financial decision to honor your
[02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:49.860]   parents.
[02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:54.580]   That's why many times you'll see wealthy people want to make sure their children are not born
[02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:55.580]   with a silver spoon in their mouth.
[02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:59.180]   They want to make sure they go out and experience life the hard way.
[02:30:59.180 --> 02:31:03.500]   And so if you say to a wealthy person, "I'm going to make this different choice because
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:06.940]   I'm saving my money," you're not going to lose face or lose status.
[02:31:06.940 --> 02:31:10.380]   You're going to gain face and gain status because you're willing to be assertive related
[02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:11.500]   to your money.
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:17.740]   On the other hand, if there's a family that is just flagrantly consuming every dollar
[02:31:17.740 --> 02:31:22.620]   in high consumption living and never building something, then you're going to be chained
[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:27.620]   eternally to spending money that you don't have because there's going to be this pressure
[02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:32.380]   from your potential spouse to spend money, spend money non-stop on these things that
[02:31:32.380 --> 02:31:33.860]   you can't afford.
[02:31:33.860 --> 02:31:43.980]   So try to look and understand what these long-term features are in your potential relationship.
[02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:46.860]   Now not all of the traits are going to be financial.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:50.660]   So it's not all just a function of money.
[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:55.100]   What you really need to be thinking about is divorce proofing as well.
[02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:59.660]   The biggest financial problem that most people face that can just wipe them out is often
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:01.300]   going to be divorce.
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:05.300]   So how do you divorce proof a marriage?
[02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:10.060]   Obviously there's a whole show here and I'm already at two and a half hours in, but let's
[02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:14.900]   start with just a little establishment of vision.
[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:21.060]   I'm pulling this from a book by relationship researcher and guru John Gottman called Seven
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:23.220]   Principles for Making Marriage Work.
[02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:27.980]   But here's what he says in the introduction to that book under a section titled The Purpose
[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:28.980]   of Marriage.
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:35.260]   "In the strongest marriages, husband and wife share a deep sense of meaning.
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:36.740]   They don't just get along.
[02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:42.100]   They also support each other's hopes and aspirations and build a sense of purpose into their lives
[02:32:42.100 --> 02:32:43.180]   together.
[02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:47.260]   That is really what I mean when I talk about honoring and respecting each other.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:53.420]   Very often a marriage's failure to do this is what causes husband and wife to find themselves
[02:32:53.420 --> 02:32:59.340]   in endless, useless rounds of argument or to feel isolated and lonely in their marriage.
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:04.420]   After watching countless videotapes of couples fighting, I can guarantee you that most quarrels
[02:33:04.420 --> 02:33:08.580]   are really not about whether the toilet lid is up or down or whose turn it is to take
[02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:09.940]   out the trash.
[02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:14.580]   There are deeper hidden issues that fuel these superficial conflicts and make them far more
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:19.220]   intense and hurtful than they would otherwise be.
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:23.940]   Once you understand this, you will be ready to accept one of the most surprising truths
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:25.820]   about marriage.
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:30.220]   Most marital arguments cannot be resolved.
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:34.980]   Couples spend year after year trying to change each other's mind, but it can't be done.
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:39.940]   This is because most of their disagreements are rooted in fundamental differences of lifestyle,
[02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:42.060]   personality, or values.
[02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:46.300]   By fighting over these differences, all they succeed in doing is wasting their time and
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:47.820]   harming their marriage.
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:52.580]   Instead, they need to understand the bottom-line difference that is causing the conflict and
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:56.700]   to learn how to live with it by honoring and respecting each other.
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:34:00.940]   Only then will they be able to build shared meaning and a sense of purpose into their
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:01.940]   marriage.
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:08.420]   So at its core, recognize that the quality of your relationship is largely determined
[02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:15.340]   by these factors of long-term vision and don't expect the person you're marrying to change.
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:22.660]   That's why you want to spend time prior to marriage observing and carefully concerned
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:25.340]   how is our relationship working out.
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:29.840]   That's why we have dating and courtship and engagement and then marriage.
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:35.140]   So judge your relationship and say, "Do I naturally have a high-quality relationship
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:39.300]   with good communication skills and mutual respect?
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:41.540]   Do we have good problem-solving ability?
[02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:46.140]   Do we have the ability to work on the relationship in a relatively easy way?"
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.220]   Divorce is fairly predictable.
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:53.860]   Let me read from the same book called, again, this is John Gottman, Seven Principles for
[02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:58.900]   Making Marriage Work, titled "Predicting Divorce with 91% Accuracy."
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:02.780]   "Thanks to decades of research, these questions can finally be answered.
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:07.460]   In fact, I can predict with great precision whether a couple will stay happily together
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:12.780]   or lose their way after listening to them interact for as little as 15 minutes.
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:18.380]   Over seven separate studies, my accuracy rate in making such predictions has averaged 91%.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:23.300]   In other words, 91% of the cases where I predicted that a couple's marriage would eventually
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:26.980]   either fail or succeed, time proved me right.
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:31.720]   I don't think my success in foretelling divorce earns me any bragging rights because it isn't
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:34.340]   due to some superhuman perception or intuition.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:41.860]   Instead, it rests solely on the science, the decades of data my colleagues and I accumulated."
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:46.860]   And then subsequently, "Emotionally intelligent marriages.
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:50.580]   What can make a marriage work is surprisingly simple.
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:55.780]   Happily married couples aren't smarter, richer, or more psychologically astute than others.
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:36:00.180]   But in their day-to-day lives, they have hit upon a dynamic that keeps their negative thoughts
[02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:06.300]   and feelings about each other, which all couples have, from overwhelming their positive ones.
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:10.620]   Rather than creating a climate of disagreement and resistance, they embrace each other's
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:11.620]   needs.
[02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:16.060]   When addressing a partner's request, their motto tends to be a helpful 'yes, and'
[02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:18.340]   rather than 'yes, but.'
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:23.220]   This positive attitude not only allows them to maintain, but also to increase the sense
[02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:29.740]   of romance, play, fun, adventure, and learning together that are at the heart of any long-lasting
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:31.020]   love affair.
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:35.820]   They have what I call an emotionally intelligent marriage."
[02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:41.020]   Emotional intelligence has become widely recognized as an important predictor of a child's success
[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:42.460]   later in life.
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:46.340]   The more in touch with feelings and the better able a child is to understand and get along
[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:51.660]   with others, the sunnier that child's future, whatever his or her academic IQ.
[02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:53.580]   The same is true for spouses.
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:59.380]   The more emotionally intelligent a couple, the better able they are to understand, honor,
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:03.660]   and respect each other and their marriage, the more likely that they will indeed live
[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:05.660]   happily ever after.
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:10.500]   Just as parents can teach their children emotional intelligence, this is also a skill that couples
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:11.740]   can learn.
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:15.740]   As simple as it sounds, developing this ability can keep husband and wife on the positive
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:18.660]   side of the divorce odds.
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:21.620]   I was intending to go in and talk about divorce proofing.
[02:37:21.620 --> 02:37:26.060]   He has this great chapter in this book where he specifically goes through and says, "Okay,
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:32.740]   let's talk about it, but let's look for the signs of what causes a marriage to go bad,
[02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:33.980]   how I predict divorce."
[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:36.460]   But it would probably take me about an hour to go through it.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:41.380]   So let me just set that aside to you and just encourage you, spend some time reading about
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:45.460]   marriage, reading about divorce, and make sure you understand what you're looking for.
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:51.820]   Especially, and again, this episode is geared towards people who are not married.
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:52.940]   That's what I'm hoping to reach.
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:56.020]   So if you are married, then you need to teach this to your children.
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:38:01.900]   The great problem, one of the great problems that people face is in our culture is we don't
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:06.600]   talk enough about the simple things that lead to positive and negative outcomes related
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:07.700]   to marriage.
[02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:11.860]   And so because we're not talking about them enough, people are spending their time largely
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:18.420]   making decisions based upon emotional attraction.
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:23.700]   Emotions are a fundamentally important component of a high quality marriage relationship.
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:27.020]   They are not the only component.
[02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:33.060]   They are the sauce on top of the food that makes the food incredibly delicious and savory,
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:35.100]   but they're not what sticks to your ribs.
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:39.620]   They're not what keeps you going through to the next meal.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:41.460]   Teach your children what to look for.
[02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:49.620]   If you're young, think about what to look for and be willing to have standards and important
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:53.100]   characteristics that you think are important that you're looking for.
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:58.140]   The next thing to look for is financial resilience and flexibility.
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.780]   And I repeat, I'm not trying to lay out all of the core components of a happy, healthy
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:03.780]   marriage.
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:04.780]   There are many, many things.
[02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:08.780]   I'm trying to focus on what are those things that are probably going to make a big difference
[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:11.340]   to the finances of a marriage.
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:16.000]   And some of them are important to keep the marriage going, but then I'm just focusing
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.500]   on the things that are financial.
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:20.980]   You will have all kinds of other things that you appreciate and look for in marriage beyond
[02:39:20.980 --> 02:39:21.980]   these factors.
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:29.000]   But you want to look for financial resiliency and flexibility in your proposed spouse.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.640]   For men, maintaining a wife in style is a very real goal for most men.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:42.900]   It brings me enormous satisfaction to give my wife nice things, to spend money on her.
[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:46.820]   I derive enormous amounts of pleasure out of it.
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:52.460]   Similarly to my children, it makes me happy to provide luxuries for her.
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:58.300]   So maintaining a wife in style is a very real and satisfying goal for most men.
[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:04.700]   Having to maintain a wife in style will poison a relationship.
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:13.380]   Her expecting to be maintained in style would eliminate all of the pleasure from my relationship.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:20.160]   And that's one of these interesting dichotomies that if you as a woman are generally low maintenance,
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:28.780]   you don't have a lot of needs, a lot of desires, your man is likely to do everything he can
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:34.660]   to provide every luxury and nicety that is within his ability, and he'll love doing it.
[02:40:34.660 --> 02:40:39.540]   But if you turn around and you start setting conditions and having requirements that this
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:45.980]   is how I have to be maintained, then it will poison your relationship.
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:49.900]   So be careful about people who have high standards.
[02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:56.140]   Make sure that the person that you are interested in is resilient and flexible, knows how to
[02:40:56.140 --> 02:41:01.180]   be abased and knows how to abound, knows how to live in luxury and in style, and knows
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:08.980]   how to live in simplicity and in a basic way, knows how to travel in luxury and knows how
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:11.700]   to travel in poverty.
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:17.100]   Just imagine that you're a woman and you're married to a man who, "I just can't eat.
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:18.100]   I just can't.
[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:22.220]   I just can't," unless everything is just right, unless your house is exactly the way it's
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:28.300]   supposed to be, unless you maintain him exactly in style, or a wife, "I just can't sleep in
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:29.300]   that.
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:30.300]   I can't."
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:34.460]   What an obnoxious persnickety people are annoying to live with.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:41.260]   And so you should develop a way of testing the financial resiliency and flexibility of
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:43.900]   your proposed spouse.
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:51.260]   I would recommend to you that you try to schedule something that is really high end, a black
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:42:00.020]   tie ball, a beautiful gala, an elaborate weekend away, and see, "How does my proposed spouse
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:05.420]   do in finery and luxury and sumptuous surroundings?
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:09.500]   Does he know his way around the dessert fork and the silverware?
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:13.700]   Does he understand how to be comfortable in high society?"
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:20.420]   I would also propose that you take a camping trip or a mission trip in an incredibly impoverished
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:26.180]   area, and you don't have access to a shower for three days, and you sleep on the ground,
[02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:34.660]   and see, "How does my proposed spouse do with these very basic and primitive conditions?"
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:42.060]   If you want your marriage to result in long-term wealth accumulation, then there will be times
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:47.580]   in which you can enjoy luxury as a family, and there will be times in which you will
[02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:51.140]   need to tighten your belts and enjoy lack.
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:55.840]   And you can, if you marry the right person and you have the right characteristics yourself,
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:01.500]   you can enjoy luxury and you can enjoy lack.
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:02.940]   That's what you're looking for.
[02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:08.620]   Next, look for someone who has an appreciation of financial reality.
[02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:10.860]   Notice I didn't say literacy yet.
[02:43:10.860 --> 02:43:12.740]   What I mean is reality.
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:15.460]   Your partner needs to be living in the real world.
[02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:17.660]   Imagine, your family is deep in debt.
[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:22.060]   You're working day and night to get out of debt, and your wife is out getting multi-hundred
[02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:26.820]   dollar beauty treatments, or your family is deep in debt, and you're working day and night
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:31.940]   to get out, and your husband is out shopping for a new gun, or new three-hundred dollar
[02:43:31.940 --> 02:43:34.140]   hunting boots, or whatever it is.
[02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:39.860]   Just imagine, you want to marry someone who can understand reality.
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:45.700]   Your spouse needs to understand that finances are real and must be respected.
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:47.000]   You're not made of money.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.700]   There are limits, and your finances are going to go up and down, and you need to be married
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:55.020]   to somebody who's willing to respect limits.
[02:43:55.020 --> 02:43:59.580]   In financial counseling, one of the things I've encountered time and time again is a
[02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:03.700]   couple who everything was going great until all of a sudden there were limits, and all
[02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:07.860]   of a sudden she went out and spent crazy amounts of money on the credit card, or he went out
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:11.860]   and bought a new truck, or just crazy things like that.
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:16.660]   You need to understand that reality and be able to communicate from a perspective of
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:21.940]   reality, marry somebody who has an appreciation of financial reality.
[02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:28.580]   Next, marry somebody who has good financial literacy, an understanding of the basics of
[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:35.380]   financial literacy, and a willingness to learn.
[02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:39.180]   I started with the big genetic things that can't be overcome in someone's lifetime.
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:42.660]   Then I moved on to the things that probably were sewed into your prospective spouse for
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:46.380]   twenty years by his or her upbringing.
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:51.940]   Financial literacy, I would say, again, can be taught in six weeks to six months.
[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:56.460]   Almost everything can be taught in weeks to months that's related to the day-to-day running
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:45:01.140]   of financial affairs.
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:06.100]   It's important, but this is the most easily overcomable thing, especially if you have
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:07.820]   willingness to learn.
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:14.180]   If the person that you are interested in is not good with money, whatever that means,
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:18.420]   I would not automatically disqualify that person.
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:24.260]   I don't think being good with money is a particularly difficult hurdle to overcome if all these
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:26.940]   other things are there.
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:31.700]   There are lots of people who are not good with money and a few years later they're multi-millionaires.
[02:45:31.700 --> 02:45:39.380]   These are the learnable, easily acquirable skills if somebody has a willingness to learn.
[02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:44.740]   Having a willingness to learn and an interest in financial topics is enormously helpful.
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:45.980]   Remember this.
[02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:53.680]   In order for you to become wealthy, your family is going to have to optimize at least something
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:57.980]   in order to make that happen, assuming that you're not inheriting wealth.
[02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:04.980]   You can optimize for income, you can optimize for low expenses, or you can optimize for
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:07.620]   investment, prowess, and knowledge.
[02:46:07.620 --> 02:46:10.940]   Any one of those things optimized will work.
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:14.280]   If you can optimize two of them, it'll work fast.
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:18.100]   And then if you can optimize three of them, you've got a slam-dunk, home-run, shortcut
[02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:19.100]   to wealth.
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:22.780]   How's that for a mixed metaphor, huh?
[02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:26.140]   The point is that you've got to optimize something.
[02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:33.440]   And so you want to think about where the interests are of each spouse and think about where would
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:34.440]   be the optimization.
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:37.140]   How are we going to work together as a team?
[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:40.500]   And then is my spouse willing to learn?
[02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:43.300]   Is there an expression of willingness?
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:49.180]   I think it works really well in marriages for individualized to specialize in at least
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:57.460]   one of those dimensions, again, income, expenses, or investments.
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:03.780]   The most frustrating, almost guaranteed failure is this.
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:08.540]   How could you be married and probably not generate much wealth?
[02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:16.040]   I would say it's probably if you have a dual-income family who are earning average amounts of
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:23.220]   money at a W-2 job, spending most of their money on consumption, and if they're investing
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:27.740]   at all, investing poorly based upon hot stock tips.
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:29.100]   That's the worst.
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:32.660]   You have high taxes paid, you have no specialization.
[02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:36.580]   Spouse and wives are basically roommates that each contributes a little bit to the pot and
[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:42.060]   each takes out of the pot and there's no function of this thing, this enterprise, this family
[02:47:42.060 --> 02:47:45.300]   enterprise isn't going anywhere.
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:50.940]   If we look at our surroundings, we can see many different models of success as to how
[02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:55.220]   a couple can build something that is truly successful.
[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:58.380]   And there's not only one, there are many models.
[02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:02.060]   Here are some of the models that I see most of the time.
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:09.940]   The first model can be that one spouse optimizes income and the other spouse optimizes the
[02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:12.580]   lifestyle and expenses.
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:17.980]   Where you've seen this historically has been where a husband has optimized income, had
[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:23.100]   a job, earned a lot of money, built a business, worked really hard at it, and his wife manages
[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:27.860]   the house, manages the household and all of the expenses.
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:34.140]   Traditionally, in very patriarchal societies, it's very common, husband goes to work, brings
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:38.460]   home the paycheck, hands his wife the paycheck, she gives him the spending money that she
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:45.420]   has, and she maintains ironclad control of the family's finances, she invests, she runs
[02:48:45.420 --> 02:48:50.180]   the family household budget, she runs the finances, the investment things, she takes
[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:52.460]   care of the children, she does all that stuff.
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:54.540]   And he works and provides the income.
[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:59.040]   And that's a very traditional, very successful model that works all around the world.
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:04.060]   And it's a matter of one spouse optimizing income, the other spouse, usually the wife,
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:09.020]   optimizing the lifestyle for the family, and then running expenses and running investments.
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:14.620]   Now if both spouses are going to optimize income, what usually seems to be the case
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:18.980]   is that both spouses aren't optimizing jobs.
[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:25.260]   On the contrary, if both spouses are optimizing income, it usually works well if one has flexibility,
[02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:29.220]   as in run my own business, have flexible hours.
[02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:34.300]   You can make it work if both spouses just have high incomes, but it can be really annoying.
[02:49:34.300 --> 02:49:40.100]   I worked a number of years ago with a couple, wonderful couple, wife was a pharmacist, husband
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:44.980]   was a physical therapist, they both were really good at what they did, but they both had jobs
[02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:47.460]   where they had to be in the office in a certain number of days.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:52.820]   They had two or three children, and they were working really hard on raising their children,
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:57.140]   and basically they never had a day off together because they each had to have a day where
[02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:58.560]   they were working.
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:02.340]   And they had babysitters some of the times, but they were very devoted parents, and basically
[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:06.540]   what they gave up is they almost never had a day off together because one of them was
[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:09.180]   working each of the seven days per week.
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:11.620]   And that was a really frustrating lifestyle for them.
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:16.280]   And so what can work well, if both spouses are going to have a job or a career, then
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:22.060]   one builds more of a flexible business that with ability to adjust hours, the other has
[02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:23.140]   the job.
[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:24.220]   That can work.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:28.820]   Another one that works is where one spouse really focuses on investments.
[02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:32.900]   This is one I've seen very frequently profiled among wealthy families.
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:39.140]   Usually husband has a business, does pretty well with business, wife takes care of the
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:44.420]   home, but has something like a real estate investment business.
[02:50:44.420 --> 02:50:47.000]   It can be, it doesn't have to be real estate, it can be anything if she's got an interest
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000]   in stocks, companies.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:51.360]   I've known a couple of ladies who were into that, but it seems like a very male-dominated
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:52.360]   field.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:56.640]   Real estate seems to really fit with what many women are interested in.
[02:50:56.640 --> 02:50:59.600]   My mom was always the queen of buying, getting deals.
[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:00.600]   She loved getting deals.
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:05.520]   Well, maybe it's a, I don't know, maybe it's an innate female trait to shop for sales and
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:06.520]   things like that.
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:11.660]   Well, you can shop for sales on clothes that your family needs and food that your family
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:15.760]   needs and you can also shop for sales on investment houses that your family needs.
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:20.600]   Then it's the same basic instinct, the same basic skills just extrapolated out to a bigger
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:21.600]   level.
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:25.440]   So, having one spouse be really focused on optimizing the investments can work really
[02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:26.440]   well.
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:29.080]   I've seen this with husbands as well.
[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:32.760]   Remember that with investing there's a point in time in which your income is the most important
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:33.760]   factor.
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:37.720]   Then as your wealth starts to grow, then now your investing prowess becomes the most important
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:38.720]   thing.
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:41.300]   So, the amount of money in your portfolio once you have a lot of assets is much more
[02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:44.940]   important than the amount of income that you're earning and contributing to the portfolio.
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:49.460]   So husband really takes a deep interest in the investment portfolio.
[02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:50.460]   Wife has a job.
[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.980]   I've seen this a lot of times with people who have a passion jobs and like school teaching.
[02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:57.740]   Husband trades stocks every morning, spends his time at home trading stocks.
[02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:58.860]   Wife is a school teacher.
[02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:00.620]   They have a really great life together.
[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:05.460]   She works for the social outlet of it and his investment work runs kind of the family
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:06.860]   enterprise.
[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:09.900]   You can make many different models work.
[02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:12.940]   The key principle is this.
[02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:20.900]   Look for a spouse that complements you, not simply duplicates you.
[02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:25.700]   One of the things I learned that makes for a successful business partnership is that
[02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:31.420]   in order for a business partnership to work for the long term, the partners have to believe
[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:36.100]   that they're better off together than apart.
[02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:42.220]   There has to be a synergy to their relationship where one plus one is more than two.
[02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:50.140]   If you have a partner who's really good at repairing and refinishing wooden floors and
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:54.300]   he's friends with someone else who's really good at repairing and refinishing wooden floors
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:59.580]   and they say, "Hey, tell you what, let's team up together and let's go out and build a business
[02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:04.600]   where we go and repair and refinish wooden floors just because we're both good at repairing
[02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:09.140]   and refinishing wooden floors," that's probably not a partnership that's destined for long
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:10.820]   term success.
[02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:14.140]   It's fun in the short term because we can do floors together.
[02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:15.180]   We like being together.
[02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:16.380]   It's fun.
[02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:19.920]   But then five years in, one of the partners wants to work six days a week and the other
[02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:21.340]   wants to work four days a week.
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:23.140]   One wants to start at six and go till six.
[02:53:23.140 --> 02:53:25.380]   The other wants to start at ten and go till four.
[02:53:25.380 --> 02:53:27.700]   And we start to have a frustration about, "Wait a second.
[02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:30.260]   Why don't you want to do as many floors as I do?"
[02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:34.500]   And unless there's just this amazingly strong compatibility of personality, they start to
[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:38.440]   suspect that they're probably better off by themselves because after all, why are we splitting
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:43.080]   the profit when in reality I could be making more and keeping more if I just did it on
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:44.080]   my own.
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.720]   We don't add to each other.
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:48.080]   Those partnerships don't work.
[02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:54.760]   What does work is if you really like refinishing wooden floors and I really like selling and
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:54:00.120]   finding clients, then we have a match made in heaven because I can go out and I can spend
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:02.760]   my time selling and having clients.
[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:06.640]   You can spend your time running the floor polisher or the floor polishing crews and
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:09.520]   both of us do what we like and we don't have to do what we don't like.
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:12.900]   And if I manage all the books for you and I manage the sales and all you got to do is
[02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:14.960]   show up and do floors, then you're happy.
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:18.160]   And on the other hand, if I don't ever have to do floors but I get to do what I like,
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:21.080]   then we're happy and we realize we're better off together.
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:25.040]   I think the same principle applies to spousal relationships.
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:28.600]   Husbands and wives that complement one another, that bring different skill sets, different
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:34.200]   personalities, a hardness, a softness, a skill here that complements that skill there.
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:38.560]   And from a financial perspective, brings a different variety.
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:47.240]   These couples seem to, I think, really work because they provide what each other provides.
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:49.760]   There's no magic formula for this.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:54.760]   I think here is where you're going to, I would revert to say, you'll know how someone makes
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:55.760]   you feel.
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:58.400]   I think that some couples, when I listen to them, they love to talk about work at the
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.440]   dinner table because they work in the same field and they work amazingly well together.
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:06.640]   I always think about Will Durant and his wife who he married very young and they just were
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.200]   this lifetime team duo of incredibly publishing.
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.920]   They just love their work together and they seem to have a productive marriage.
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:17.760]   But then there's people who just don't ever want to talk about business with my wife because
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.760]   that's not what she's into.
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:19.760]   It's not what I'm into.
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:23.160]   I talk about business with other people but they also have really productive relationships.
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:26.520]   I don't know of any rule that is the best key.
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.100]   I just think that you want to have complementary skill sets.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:33.120]   Any success model can work.
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:38.380]   The ones I see work most frequently are the ones where the husband optimizes the income
[02:55:38.380 --> 02:55:45.160]   and the income generation and the wife optimizes the expense management, the lifestyle management,
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.240]   making sure the children are doing their homework so they're going to go to the elite schools
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:54.040]   where they're going to meet smart women and all of the stuff and super hardcore on that.
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:57.080]   And then investment knowledge can go either way based on interest.
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.000]   I've seen it where wives just are wizards with investments.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.320]   I've seen it the other way around.
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:06.120]   So meaning where the husband's that's totally their deal.
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:08.400]   You're going to at the end of the day there are no rules in this stuff.
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:14.040]   You work it out with your spouse and that's where a good relationship is important.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:19.000]   Finally I would say look for values that are related to financial productivity, cultural
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:20.000]   values.
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:27.440]   Seeing hard work as a virtue, not as a vice, is probably a good sign to look for.
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:33.280]   Imagine you're a young woman and you see a man who just sees that his goal in life is
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.720]   to escape from hard work and he's doing everything he can to get out of hard work and to shirk
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:38.720]   it.
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:41.720]   Probably not a good marker of long term success.
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:44.960]   Seeing hard work as a virtue, not a vice, is a good thing.
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:47.000]   Same thing for a man looking for a woman.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:53.520]   Seeing a woman who embraces hard work as something to be appreciated and to be enjoyed, that's
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:56.640]   a good indicator.
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:56:58.960]   Being employed as a sign of good health is a good indicator.
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:03.400]   A guy who's running from employment just doesn't want to work, it's probably not going to work
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:04.560]   out so well in the long term.
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.100]   He'll make just enough money to make it for a few weeks and then be done.
[02:57:08.100 --> 02:57:13.880]   On the other hand, a guy who sees being employed as a fundamentally healthy thing to do, probably
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:16.440]   going to make more money and be more employed.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:20.600]   Seeing frugality as a healthy discipline, not something to be run from, is good.
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:26.600]   Most historically successful cultures have some expression of asceticism.
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:31.600]   It can be fasting, it can be some way where you're denying yourself and I think that frugality
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:38.120]   can express some of those aspects of fasting that are really healthy for us, that we spend
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:39.220]   less than we could spend.
[02:57:39.220 --> 02:57:41.440]   It's a good and useful discipline.
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:47.180]   Seeing risk-taking as something to be admired is something that could result in great wins,
[02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:48.580]   could result in great losses.
[02:57:48.580 --> 02:57:49.620]   You be the choice.
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:50.620]   The choice is yours.
[02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:51.620]   What do you want?
[02:57:51.620 --> 02:57:52.620]   But a culture of that.
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:58:00.280]   And there's many, many other things, but look for values that are related to financial productivity.
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:07.460]   On the whole, as you are considering somebody that you're interested in marrying, recognize
[02:58:07.460 --> 02:58:12.800]   that you're getting the whole package.
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:17.540]   There's a good chance that the person that you're marrying is not going to change much.
[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:21.840]   Your children are kind of going to be like this person that you're marrying.
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:23.640]   So think about that.
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:28.140]   When you're looking for a wife, what are the qualities that you want in your sons and daughters?
[02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:30.140]   Because that's what you're going to get.
[02:58:30.140 --> 02:58:32.380]   So make sure that you're marrying someone of those qualities.
[02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:36.640]   If you're looking for a husband, what are the qualities that you want in your sons and
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:37.780]   daughters?
[02:58:37.780 --> 02:58:38.780]   Guess what?
[02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:40.260]   You're going to get them.
[02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:43.300]   They're going to be like the person that you're marrying.
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:45.200]   People don't change that much.
[02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:51.400]   And so look at the family, look at the circumstances, and recognize that there's a good chance statistically
[02:58:51.400 --> 02:58:57.060]   speaking that the results that I get are probably going to be something like this, like what
[02:58:57.060 --> 02:59:01.220]   I see, and people probably aren't going to change very much.
[02:59:01.220 --> 02:59:05.720]   So if you like these qualities that this person is expressing, great.
[02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:06.720]   Nail them down.
[02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:07.720]   Nail her down.
[02:59:07.720 --> 02:59:10.020]   Get to marriage as quickly as you can.
[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:13.940]   If you don't like these qualities, look for another option.
[02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:22.360]   If you don't have another better option, then either continue to look, figure out how can
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:24.820]   I bring more potential candidates into my life?
[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:28.660]   How can I create a better sales funnel with more prospects?
[02:59:28.660 --> 02:59:34.540]   Or how can I upgrade myself in order to be more attractive to the kind of person that
[02:59:34.540 --> 02:59:37.260]   I want to attract?
[02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:43.420]   If you want to attract as a man, if you want to attract a 10 out of 10, a woman who is
[02:59:43.420 --> 02:59:48.420]   going to be just drop dead gorgeous, she's going to fit in in every social situation,
[02:59:48.420 --> 02:59:52.540]   she's going to look phenomenal in a ball gown, and just as cute when she wakes up sleeping
[02:59:52.540 --> 02:59:57.220]   on the dirt next to you on the Appalachian Trail, and she's going to bear you 10 children,
[02:59:57.220 --> 03:00:01.960]   and they're all going to go to Ivy League education, and she's going to teach them French
[03:00:01.960 --> 03:00:07.020]   and Latin and history and mathematics and calculus, and she's incredibly smart, and
[03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:11.820]   she's got two advanced degrees, but she's going to give it all up for you to be your
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:15.660]   doting loving wife, guess what?
[03:00:15.660 --> 03:00:20.220]   She's out there, and you got to be a 10 out of 10 to attract her, because she's got every
[03:00:20.220 --> 03:00:21.660]   option in the world.
[03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:27.140]   So you're going to have to be mega focused on being as attractive as you possibly can,
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:31.220]   working as diligently as possible to meet her, and to meet her young before she takes
[03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:34.340]   the cream of the crop from somewhere else.
[03:00:34.340 --> 03:00:39.360]   If you're a woman, and you're trying to tie down a man, and you just want a guy who's
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:43.800]   going to make a million dollars a year, and he's six foot four, and he's got a ripped
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:49.500]   six pack, and he loves you and wants to spend many, many hours a week with you, and all
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:56.880]   the – you make your list, recognize you're going to have to figure out what he wants,
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:01:01.300]   and you're going to have to figure out how to develop that and offer that to him.
[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:06.940]   And anywhere in the middle, you can't change the other person, but you can change yourself.
[03:01:06.940 --> 03:01:10.740]   You can change yourself and what you have to offer, what you bring to the table, and
[03:01:10.740 --> 03:01:18.420]   you can change the environments you put yourself in where you're most likely to meet this person.
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:22.480]   Every single aspect of this is a skill.
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:23.940]   Social things, skills.
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.580]   Money management, skills.
[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:27.540]   Academic abilities, skills.
[03:01:27.540 --> 03:01:32.980]   There certainly seem to be basic inborn differences among us.
[03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:36.740]   Some of us are smarter, some of us are stronger, some of us are bigger, some of us are smaller,
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:39.880]   some of us are prettier, some of us are not.
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:44.400]   You work with what you got, and you enhance it to the absolute maximum.
[03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:50.200]   But don't be scared to set standards for what you're looking for.
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:57.200]   If you want to be wealthy in the long term, marry a spouse that is going to make it probable
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:58.880]   that you are wealthy.
[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:01.180]   So go ahead, set your standards.
[03:02:01.180 --> 03:02:04.920]   Marry somebody who's going to make it happen, who's going to make that likely.
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:11.800]   But you're going to have to step up and develop yourself if you're just not naturally, innately
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:13.200]   gifted on those levels.
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:15.020]   I hope this has been useful for you.
[03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:17.520]   Take whatever is useful, discard the rest.
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:19.040]   Take it and talk about it.
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:26.000]   We've got a lot of work to do within our families, within our local cultures, and more broadly,
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:31.080]   because it's our responsibility to help younger people to think.
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:34.880]   We've got to cultivate and fix some of the problems that our society has created.
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:38.420]   And if you're younger, just know I'm doing my best to fulfill my responsibility to give
[03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:39.420]   you useful thoughts.
[03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:42.140]   Again, take what's useful, discard the rest.
