[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.840]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.720]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.000]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   and here with me in the studio today is Liz Moody,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.120]   making her second appearance on the show.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.000]   Liz is a writer, cookbook author,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.740]   and host of the Liz Moody Podcast.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.420]   And she has a new book that's filled
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.200]   with so many great science-backed tactics
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.240]   to level up your health, happiness,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000]   success, and relationships.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.240]   And I'm so excited to dive into a lot of them today.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.640]   The book is called "100 Ways to Change Your Life."
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640]   It comes out next week, but you can pre-order it now.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.860]   And I am so excited for this conversation.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.100]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.400]   There is nothing better than finding a brand of clothing
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.020]   that's comfortable, functional, and looks good.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.640]   And that's exactly how I feel
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.720]   about our sponsor today, Viore.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.920]   If you saw me in person, you'd know I believe it
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.900]   because there are very few days that go by
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.280]   where I'm not wearing one, two,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.380]   or even three pieces of Viore.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.760]   They make performance apparel for men and women
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.440]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.160]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.440]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.760]   And it is so comfortable,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.520]   you'll want to wear it all the time.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760]   I've long said that Sunday performance joggers
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.520]   were my favorites, and don't get me wrong,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.080]   I have at least three pairs,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.300]   and they are the most comfortable pants I've owned.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.640]   But I've been running a lot more,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.380]   and it's still warm in California,
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.280]   so I'm wearing my core shorts all the time.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.140]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.180]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.420]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.960]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.440]   and running around town.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.220]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.520]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.080]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.580]   - Liz, thanks for being here.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.620]   - Thank you so much for having me again.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.840]   - Again, I know, this is two times,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.960]   except now you have a book that is new.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.000]   You've had books before.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.840]   I'm a little jealous.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.240]   I'm working on one book, you've already got how many?
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.080]   - Three.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.400]   Two are cookbooks, and one of the cookbooks
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.800]   is about popsicles, so maybe that's a half a book.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.680]   It's a little baby book.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.560]   - So, two and a half books?
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   - Two and a half books.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.360]   - Well, this is a great one.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.820]   I didn't have the previous books.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.660]   I have this one.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.720]   I got to read this one,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   and I'm really excited you're here
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.940]   because a lot of what your book's about
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.920]   is a lot of what my audience loves,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.080]   which is finding tactical ways to improve your life
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.400]   across a bunch of verticals
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.120]   that you can do without spending a fortune.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   - 100%.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.120]   I feel like I read so many personal growth books,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.360]   and I'll read it, and I'll get like a good, warm feeling
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.960]   while I'm reading it, and then I close the book,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.840]   and immediately I'm like, what do I actually do?
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.440]   I feel just, what next?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   What now?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.320]   And I really wanted to create a book
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   that answered that question,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   and that gave people the science
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.740]   behind the tools that they need,
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.520]   and then the real tactical tips
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.920]   that they can apply today to change their lives.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.760]   - So there's 100.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160]   We don't have time to get through all of them.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.040]   I tried, by the way.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   Liz said, no, we have to limit it.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.800]   We can't go through all 100.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.160]   - I was just trying to make it a good use of your time
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.200]   and your audience's time.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.400]   - In the book, you break it into health, happiness,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   success, and relationships,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.920]   and I wanted to run through each
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.040]   and talk about a few of the things I pulled out
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.800]   and get you to dive a little deeper,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.680]   share some of that science behind it,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.600]   and if people want the rest, obviously there's a book.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.680]   We're not gonna get through all 100.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.000]   I was trying to think of where to start,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.240]   and I don't really have a formula for where to start,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.440]   so I just picked success.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   - Okay, let's start with success.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.960]   When it comes to goals and building habits,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.320]   I want to talk about the fresh start effect
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.640]   'cause it feels like a good fresh start
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.520]   for the conversation.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   - So this is from research from Dr. Katie Milkman.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.240]   Katie Milkman is a podcast guest that I've had on.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.320]   She's a behavioral scientist from Wharton
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.600]   at University of Pennsylvania,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   and she is probably the most cited guest by other guests,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.040]   so other guests come on and they're like,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   oh, according to Dr. Katie Milkman's research,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.360]   and she's shared so much research
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   that I've put into this book
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.560]   because she works on habits and goals and behavior change,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.920]   and her stuff is so actionable in the moment.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.960]   - So the fresh start effect is really simple,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.880]   and it's the idea that research shows
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.720]   that we view our life in this really narrative way.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.560]   So we view ourselves as books,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.600]   and then different moments in our lives,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.160]   different periods of our lives are like chapters in a book,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   and when we turn the page,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.800]   and we can turn the page, start a new chapter
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.760]   by starting a new job, moving to a new house,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.440]   New Year's Eve would be turning a huge page.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.840]   We feel like we're not the same person
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   that we were the chapter before,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   and thus, we're not stuck with the same habits
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.200]   and behaviors that we had the chapter before.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.600]   So it's really, really helpful
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   if you're trying to make a behavior change
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.760]   to identify a fresh start in your life
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   so that you can be like, okay,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   in the last house, I didn't work out, I didn't meditate,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.800]   I was on my phone way too much,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.280]   but now that I've moved in this new house,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.720]   I'm not that same person anymore.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.560]   I'm not gonna have those same behaviors.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.680]   Literally picking up my book is a fresh start
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.560]   because you are not the same person
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   that you were before you had this book,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   and knowing that science is on your side,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.040]   if you just have that awareness,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.640]   the person that I was before maybe couldn't stick
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.240]   to this habit, couldn't achieve this goal,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.320]   but I'm not them anymore, so I can.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.560]   Any time in your life that you can identify,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.720]   like I want to be a different person than I was before,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   what's a fresh start that I can identify here to begin that?
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.040]   It's also why it's great to start new habits and routines
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.200]   on a Monday, on a first of the month,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.960]   on a New Year's Eve, things like that.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.080]   You can give yourself a little bit of a push.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.720]   - I love this, and another Milkman one.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.280]   So we have this fresh start, we're ready to go.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.400]   I have a problem procrastinating all the time.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.480]   So let's talk a little bit about that
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.200]   'cause I think that's another one that she brought to you.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.440]   - So one of my favorite tips for procrastination,
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.160]   I have a bunch of tips for procrastination
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.200]   because it is something that I struggle with really deeply,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.480]   but one of my favorite ones from Dr. Milkman
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.160]   is called temptation bundling,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.200]   and basically it's the idea that you take tasks
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.880]   that you don't want to do and you bundle them
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   with the thing that you absolutely love the most.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.400]   So for me, I cannot make myself work out for the life of me.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.640]   I hate it so much.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.360]   I work out in the morning and I'll literally stall
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.640]   on the entire rest of my day
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.000]   because I cannot convince myself to do a workout.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   But I save my very favorite podcasts
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.000]   for the time that I work out,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.320]   and I only get to listen to those podcasts
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.440]   when I am working out.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.000]   So I have bundled those things,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.680]   I've made the workout more appealing,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.440]   and I'm thus more likely to do it,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.760]   to not procrastinate on it, and to actually get it done.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   So you can do that with anything you want to do in your life
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.840]   that you have a hard time doing.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.600]   It can be like a little treat
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   that you only give yourself when you're doing paperwork
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   or taxes or something like that.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   I like to watch my favorite Real Housewives
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.720]   I've gotten really into Real Housewives recently.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.560]   For the first time in my life,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.240]   it's like an exciting adventure for me.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   I only get to watch it when I'm folding laundry
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.600]   because I hate folding laundry.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.400]   So it's taking the thing you love the most
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.760]   and you are only allowed to do it.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   You can watch other shows,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.680]   you can listen to other podcasts,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.520]   other times in your life,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.760]   but you can only do the one you love the most
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.360]   when you're doing the thing that you want to do
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.480]   that you don't like.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   - How do you think that compares
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.080]   to creating self-imposed penalties
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.800]   or other ways to motivate yourself?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.640]   - So there's a lot of, again, procrastination tips
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.760]   in this book because it's something
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.680]   that I really struggle with.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.280]   So I think self-imposed penalties,
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   that's another bit of Dr. Melkman's research.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.440]   We have an entire podcast with Dr. Melkman
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   about habits and routines.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   I think it's called something like
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   how to get more in shape, save more money.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.560]   It's like all of these promises,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.680]   but the thing is that Dr. Melkman's research
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.240]   comes back to achieving anything you want to achieve
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.400]   in any part of your life.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.600]   So the self-imposed penalties is really fun.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.440]   That would be something as easy as signing up
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.120]   for a workout class that you have to pay for in advance,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.840]   that if you cancel, you don't get your money back,
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.320]   you're significantly more likely, research shows,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.280]   to actually attend that workout class.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.520]   If you want to take a vacation
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.720]   and you're one of those people who really has a hard time
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.480]   carving out the time in your life,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.160]   even though so much research shows
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.240]   we perform better at work,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   we're happier in our relationship,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.760]   we're healthier when we take our vacation days,
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.320]   but if that is you, if you pay for your vacation
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   ahead of time and you make it non-refundable,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.040]   you're so much more likely to take it, obviously.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.800]   So knowing the way that our brain works
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.720]   can help us actually stick to the things
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.320]   that we want to stick to in that way.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.160]   - There's an awesome book called "Happy Money."
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.840]   It's basically like five or six tips
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.240]   to use your money to be happier.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.440]   And one of them is prepaying for vacations
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.560]   or things in general.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.360]   And the argument there is a little bit different.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.760]   So this is a double bonus if you prepay for vacations.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.960]   Both you commit to going,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.600]   but at the end, you don't have to pay the bill.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.840]   When you're done, you're not like,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.040]   "And I have to spend this thing."
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.760]   So it's not a letdown at the end of your trip.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   And even hotels that aren't pay at the end,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.600]   you can call them and say,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.680]   "Hey, can I just give you the credit card now?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.520]   "Can you run it now?"
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.360]   Even if it's refundable, they'll refund you,
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.720]   but you get rid of that moment at the end of your trip
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.200]   where you see the bill and you realize
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   how much room service, cocktails on the beach,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.160]   whatever it was you ordered,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   you can prepay for at least the room part
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.600]   usually in advance.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.560]   Tell them to send your bill.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.120]   Don't need to sign at the end
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.640]   and kind of shelve the spending.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.720]   Even better if you prepay
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.920]   and you don't even have it show up on your expenses,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.040]   your tracking, anything.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.440]   - Do you know what girl math is?
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.040]   - I didn't know math had a gender.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.400]   - It's like a TikTok trend right now,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.000]   but it's like if you return packages,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.560]   you're making money, that's girl math.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.400]   It's the idea that all of these ways
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.160]   that we can like begin to justify purchases in our minds
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.520]   and any gender can enjoy girl math,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   but it's called girl math.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.200]   And I do think there's also something
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   about paying for something in advance
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.280]   that when you go do it, it's free and that's girl math.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.200]   And like, I feel like if I paid for a trip six months ago
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.320]   and I go on it, I'm like, oh my gosh, it's a free trip.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   - Although I will say the counter to this
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.360]   is I've met so many people that have paid for something
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440]   and then they do it even though they don't wanna do it
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.600]   because they've paid for it.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.400]   This sunk cost fallacy thing is really messing with people.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.440]   I have a friend who once was like,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.680]   I don't really wanna go to this concert.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.240]   It's raining, it's gonna be awful.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240]   And they're like, but I paid for it.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   And I was like, just don't go.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   And they're like, well, I already paid for it.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.080]   I was like, you paid for it.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.600]   Whether you go or don't go, shelve that decision aside
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400]   and now say, I've already spent this money.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.360]   What do I wanna do tonight?
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.120]   What's gonna be the most enjoyable thing tonight?
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   - I would also say if people are feeling like that,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   go do the thing.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.320]   If you wanna go home early, go home early.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.760]   But I think often we really underestimate
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.440]   how much we're gonna enjoy having an experience
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   and we overestimate how much we will feel safe
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.120]   and comfortable and happy being at home
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.080]   and essentially consuming other people's lives
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.360]   on television and social media.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.480]   So I would say air towards going to the concert.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.040]   And if you absolutely hate it, then go home.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.840]   - You're trending us towards a conversation
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.400]   about not saying no to yourself.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.840]   Which is great because it was the last one
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.320]   I wanted to hit on in success.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.800]   - This is my life motto.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   I give never be the one to say no to yourself credit
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   for so much of my success, which is fine
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   because it's my motto and I came up with it.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.640]   I can give it the credit.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880]   But I don't even know where this came from in my life.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.360]   I feel like I have never been the one to say no to yourself
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.760]   since I was five years old.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.080]   The first time I can think of that I never be the one
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.280]   to say no to yourself was when I was a teenager.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.480]   And I was like, I wanna write a newspaper column.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.760]   And I walked into my local newspaper.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.400]   I was like, you should have a column for teenagers
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.080]   and it should be written by a teenager.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.920]   And they were like, okay.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   And so then I wrote a newspaper column
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.600]   and that column gave me writing experience.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.040]   It ended up being nationally syndicated,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.920]   which was really fun.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.200]   And then when I graduated from college,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   I was able to run an editorial team
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   despite having just graduated from college
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   'cause I had six years by then
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   of newspaper experience under my belt.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.880]   And I got my first cookbook deal
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.960]   by never being the one to say no to myself.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.240]   I got my second cookbook deal.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.800]   I got my dream job in editorial in New York City.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.720]   And the principle behind never being the one
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.320]   to say no to yourself is not that everybody in the world
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.560]   will always say yes to you.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.200]   I have gotten so many nos in my life,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.120]   but the principle is that you are never the one
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.440]   telling yourself no.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.920]   You are saying unequivocally, Liz, I believe in you.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.760]   You've got this.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.120]   If the world doesn't agree, cool, whatever.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.160]   That's good information.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.680]   You can go out and find somebody else to say yes,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.560]   or you can accept the no, you can learn from the no,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   and you can move on.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.000]   But I think always being in your own corner
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.680]   and your own cheerleader is such a powerful message
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.640]   to give your brain.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.160]   And by and large, when you are telling yourself no,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.040]   there is likely a yes out there.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.880]   I have people who have gotten married
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.440]   because they have asked out somebody
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.520]   that they did not think would say yes to them,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.680]   and then it ended up being a beautiful relationship
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.560]   and is now a partnership with children.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.840]   I have so many people who write to me
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   and they have gotten raises
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.440]   they didn't think were possible.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.240]   They've gotten houses that they didn't think
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.560]   that they could qualify.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.320]   They wrote letters to the house owners
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.880]   and they were like, I really want your house.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880]   And they gave it to them.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.040]   There's so many areas in our lives
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.720]   that we are limiting ourselves
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.680]   that if we just went out and we looked,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.080]   we would likely get a yes.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.440]   - How do you think you combat that
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.680]   with being irrationally optimistic
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.960]   and convincing yourself that you can do anything
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.840]   when in reality, some things maybe you can't?
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.360]   - Most of the most successful people that I know
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.040]   are irrationally optimistic.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.320]   There was some quote I read ages ago
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   that was like, to be a successful business person,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.720]   you literally need to be delusional
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.680]   because you have to have such a belief in things working
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.040]   that odds show shouldn't work.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.680]   So I think you can use no's as information.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.440]   If you're trying to write a book
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.880]   and you go out and you get 25 no's from agents,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.400]   that's probably good information.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.760]   You can ask them why the no.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.240]   You can use that to rework your proposal and go out again.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.760]   But I do think that is so much better
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.640]   than saying no to yourself, never writing the proposal,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.920]   never getting out there.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.880]   And I think that you can learn from that
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.160]   and then you can take that information
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.480]   and go forward the next time.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.880]   - So what about areas of life
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.120]   where there isn't a no to go get?
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.680]   For example, if you wanna go start a podcast
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.000]   or start a blog, there's no no.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.920]   You can just do it and you can keep doing it for years.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.800]   How do you find out when to stop on something like that
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.880]   and say no to yourself?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.000]   - So the thing that I run into the most
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.800]   with my audience and with people I talk to
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.760]   is not I've started a podcast,
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.120]   I've put in the work for years,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.640]   I'm not qualified to do this,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.040]   I'm not learning, I'm not growing.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.720]   It's I wanna start a podcast,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.920]   but I don't think I'm good enough.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.000]   I wanna start a podcast,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.840]   but what's all the equipment that I need to buy?
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.680]   I wanna start a podcast,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.360]   but I spent 17 hours browsing Amazon
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.800]   trying to figure out what camera
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.160]   and what microphone I should get.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   And I think those are different ways
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.640]   that we are saying no to ourselves
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.160]   in the creation process.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.320]   One really powerful way to say yes to yourself
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   is to say I have the tools that I need to create.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.560]   What I create is gonna be probably really shitty
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.600]   and the thing that's gonna make it less shitty
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   is to continue to create it over time.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   Most podcasters I know suck at the beginning.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.680]   They put out really bad podcasts, myself included,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.960]   for one podcast, two podcasts, three podcasts.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.120]   How many podcasts have you done now?
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   - Probably 136.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.240]   - Hundreds of podcasts.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.720]   And that's how you get good at a craft
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.000]   is by starting with the shitty microphone,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.440]   the shitty camera, no camera at all, no microphone,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.800]   doing it on your computer
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.120]   and then learning and growing from the process.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.680]   I meet far less people who have honed their craft
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.920]   over years and years and years
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.360]   and not gotten to a place where the quality
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.880]   is good enough or better.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.880]   And I meet so many people who quit
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.200]   before they even begin.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.160]   - And if someone listening is thinking in their head,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.000]   what equipment?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.920]   I would just say buy an ATR 2100X mic.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.760]   It's a hundred bucks.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.480]   It's what I used for the first 50 episodes
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.720]   and plug it into your computer
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.880]   and record it and put your podcast into script.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.720]   That's it.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.560]   - I read ages ago,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.040]   that's what Tim Ferriss still uses for his podcasts.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.600]   And I was like, okay, that's good enough.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.880]   - I remember on the video, I was like,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.720]   what was he using?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   But yeah, there's basically like three tiers
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.040]   of podcast microphones.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.160]   That one, the one I'm on and the one you're on
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.400]   and like, those are the three tiers
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.480]   and there are plenty of others,
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.360]   but you can grow as much as you need
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.240]   on a basic microphone if your content is good.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.560]   - A hundred percent.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.640]   - So hopefully people are feeling
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.240]   like they are set up for success,
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.040]   but obviously there's a lot more ways to do that.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.960]   Go read the rest.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.920]   I love it when companies build amazing products
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.160]   to make our lives better,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   but it's even cooler when they help make the world
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.000]   a better place,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.800]   which is why I'm so excited to be partnering
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.680]   with Daffy today because they're on a mission
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.520]   to help people be more generous more often.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.280]   I've been a Daffy customer for years
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.320]   because I love that they have an easy platform
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.840]   and app to efficiently manage the way we give
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.640]   to the charities we care about.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.120]   They do that by helping you set up
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.880]   a special tax advantaged account
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.520]   called the Donor Advised Fund
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.280]   that you can contribute cash, stock, or crypto to
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.440]   on a one-time or recurring basis
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.760]   and take your tax deduction upfront
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.200]   and then distribute that money
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.880]   to over one and a half million charities, schools,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.680]   or faith-based organizations whenever you want.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.200]   And if you own any appreciated stock,
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.960]   you'll wanna check out the calculator they just built
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.480]   because you might be surprised
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.240]   at how much more you can save donating stock
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   or index funds to charity instead of donating cash.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   So if you wanna optimize your giving
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.720]   in the most tax-efficient way,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.960]   head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.880]   where you can get a free $25
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.120]   to start giving today.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.920]   Are you finally ready to say goodbye
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.880]   to your big wireless plans, jaw-dropping monthly bills,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.560]   and unexpected overages?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.000]   No joke, some of those plans are over $100 per month
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.720]   for just one line.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.520]   So you need to check out our sponsor today, Mint Mobile,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.880]   where for a limited time,

[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.840]   I know how great this move can be
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.360]   because we just switched a line over to Mint Mobile
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.000]   so our au pair could get unlimited talk, text,

[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.160]   Seriously, we're gonna save so much
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.320]   without really sacrificing anything.

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.720]   Let's talk about health.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.440]   There is a whole section here on gut health.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.360]   I don't even know where to begin there.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.400]   It's something I've never spent much time on.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   If I'm thinking of all the things I can do
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.440]   to improve my life, why is making my gut better important?
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.600]   - Okay, so two things.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.280]   One thing is that this book wants to solve
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.520]   all of the problems that you are having
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.320]   that are keeping you from living the life
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   that you wanna live on a day-to-day basis.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.120]   So if you're feeling bloated,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.400]   if you're feeling constipated,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.080]   if you're feeling like you don't have the energy
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   that you want, that's all gonna be covered
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.040]   in the gut health section.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.680]   But moreover, and I think far more importantly,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.920]   is that our microbiome impacts so much
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.080]   of our full-body health.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.400]   So our microbiome is having a huge impact
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.280]   on our ability to sleep well, on our energy levels,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.160]   on our hormones, on our mental health.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.560]   The gut-brain connection is very well-studied
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.360]   and it has a very profound effect.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.040]   - But what are the kinds of things I could do?
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.560]   Like, are there ways that I can upgrade
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.800]   what I'm already eating that's not too hard
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.760]   to improve my gut health?
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.520]   - So this is a big thing that I've found.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.440]   I've interviewed hundreds of different doctors,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.040]   gut health experts, microbiome experts, hormone experts,
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   all these different people.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.800]   And one of the questions I always get
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   is what are the best foods that you should eat?
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.280]   And there's a lot of dissonance
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.200]   about what our diet should actually look like
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.040]   on social media.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.600]   And people are confused and I get that.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.000]   But I think if you actually dive
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.600]   into what people are saying,
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.680]   the things people are disagreeing about
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.640]   are like the top 10% and they're agreeing
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.000]   about the other 90%.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.800]   And so what this book really focuses on
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.480]   is what are the experts agreeing on?
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.800]   What does the research show?
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.360]   And what are the ways that we can take the foods
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.920]   that we are already eating
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.400]   and make them even better for us
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.760]   without spending more money on fancy powders
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.160]   and supplements and just all of this stuff
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.600]   when we're taking care of our base structure
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.520]   you do not need?
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.800]   So some of my favorite tips are things like
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.880]   if you chop your cruciferous vegetables
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.920]   and you let them sit for 40 minutes,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.680]   they develop a compound that's incredibly good
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.520]   for our bodies.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.720]   It's anti-cancerous.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.160]   It helps with our brains.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.280]   And then if you add mustard to that,
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.600]   you actually increase that compound even further.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.680]   And so you're just taking something
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.600]   that you would normally eat.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.200]   You're taking your cruciferous vegetables.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.720]   - Which by the way are what?
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.880]   - That's broccoli, that's Brussels sprouts,
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.200]   that's watercress, that's kale, anything like that.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.760]   And you're taking these foods you'd already eat
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.840]   and you're just chopping them
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.480]   at the beginning of your meal prep.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.600]   So you're making your salad,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   chop your cruciferous vegetables first.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.680]   By the time you're ready to eat,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.560]   they will have developed this compound.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.400]   And then if you want to take it to the next level,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.520]   do a little mustard vinaigrette on top of your salad,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.840]   do some mustard seeds on top of your roasted broccoli,
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.120]   which is so good.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.920]   And you're taking it even further.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   And you're taking this food group
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.760]   that you're already eating
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.440]   and you're making it even better for yourself.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.760]   - And some of the things you mentioned,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.240]   I'm not feeling bloated right now,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.520]   but who doesn't want more energy?
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.040]   So I wanna make sure we hit on that section of health
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.680]   because I don't know that many people
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.400]   that aren't struggling with energy.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.600]   Maybe it's 'cause I'm now hanging out
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.720]   with lots of people with children
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.560]   and we're not sleeping as much as we used to
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.960]   and we don't have the free time we used to.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   But what tips do you have there?
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.680]   - Our metabolism is essentially the energy of our body,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.240]   but we talk about it in this shitty,
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.440]   diet-centric, '90s magazine type way.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   Like, "Oh my God, you gotta hack your metabolism.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.480]   You gotta lose weight."
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   And no, taking care of our metabolic health
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.240]   is going to give us the energy that we need
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.000]   to take on our day every single day.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.320]   There's a few ways that we can begin
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.960]   to have better metabolic health.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.480]   One of my favorite ways is just to look for the things
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.920]   that you can add to your meals.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.480]   You wanna add a healthy source of fat.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.960]   You wanna add a healthy source of fiber.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.800]   You wanna add as much vegetables to your meals
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.680]   as you possibly can.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.400]   So looking at your plate and instead of thinking,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.640]   "What am I taking out?"
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.120]   You're thinking, "I got exactly what I want.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.240]   I got my frozen pizza.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.560]   Could I add some fiber in the form of vegetables?
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.040]   Could I add a healthy fat?
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   Could I add a healthy protein to this thing
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.160]   that you're already eating?"
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.720]   To elongate your blood sugar curve
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   so that you're having a healthier metabolic response
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.480]   to that, which is in turn going to give you more energy.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.800]   Another little metabolic health hack that I love
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.040]   is that your muscles essentially act as glucose sponges.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.800]   So after you eat a meal,
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.280]   your muscles are soaking up that glucose
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.640]   so that you're not having, again, that spike and that dip
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.680]   that's gonna cost you your precious energy.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.360]   So after you eat a meal, you can go on a little walk.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.320]   There's a reason that this is so popular
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.840]   in so many cultures around the world.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.440]   You can do five squats.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.200]   You just wanna activate your muscles
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.320]   to create that glucose absorption to elongate that curve
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.720]   so that you're gonna have more energy as a result
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.960]   and you're taking better care
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   of your metabolic health as a result.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.520]   Also, you can get a little bit of a headstart on that
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.640]   by creating bigger, stronger muscles in the first place.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.400]   So weight training, anything that you do
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.600]   that's going to make bigger, stronger muscles
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.240]   is going to help, again, with that glucose response.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.000]   - Is it better to focus on all your muscles?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.920]   Should you do one of those quick, three-minute,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.280]   hit-every-muscle group-in-your-body exercises?
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.880]   Or is there a perfect thing that doesn't look too awkward
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.920]   a few minutes after dinner that you can do?
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920]   - I think that this is an example
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.040]   of where people try to over-optimize
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.960]   and they lose sight of the forest for the trees.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.000]   Any movement after you eat
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.640]   is going to activate your muscles.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.440]   If you think you're activating your muscles,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.800]   you are activating your muscles.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.600]   So again, literally, don't overthink it.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.440]   Go on a walk.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.040]   If you can't go on a walk, do some squats.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.600]   You can have sex with your partner.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.160]   You can do all sorts of things.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.760]   If you think you're activating your muscles,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.000]   you're activating your muscles.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.240]   - Okay, so we can get healthier and we can get happier.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.760]   So I wanna talk about happiness.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.160]   We can all agree that it's a noble goal
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.920]   for all of us to achieve more of it.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.920]   So what's one way you can start
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.160]   to rewire yourself to be happier?
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.440]   - This is probably my all-time favorite tip in the book.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.720]   This is from Dr. Rick Hansen.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.680]   He's at UC Berkeley.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.200]   He has the kindest energy of any human being
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.760]   that I have ever met in my life.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.720]   And he's brilliant.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   He combines neuroscience with Zen Buddhism.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.160]   He's just a brilliant man.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.200]   And he talks about how we can literally rewire
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.520]   our neural pathways so that we can feel the way
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.160]   that we wanna feel on a day-to-day basis.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.600]   And the way that you do it is this.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   If you picture your brain like a meadow
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.760]   and you're trying to get through the meadow
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.040]   and there's tall grass everywhere
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.400]   and you're looking for the path
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   and you're gonna take the path
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.480]   that is the easiest path to get through the meadow.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.040]   Every time you're thinking a thought that I'm so stressed,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.360]   I hate myself so much.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.600]   Why is this so hard?
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.640]   Why does everybody hate me?
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.840]   You're essentially taking those thoughts
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.600]   and you're rewiring your neural pathways in that direction.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.040]   You're carving a path through that meadow.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   So the next time that your brain is looking
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.120]   to take a path through the meadow,
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   it's gonna take the one that you already created
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.320]   with those negative thoughts.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.560]   It's gonna go to those negative thoughts
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.200]   and you're gonna feel really shitty.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.440]   But if you intentionally create a pathway for good thoughts,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.920]   your brain, the next time it's given the opportunity
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.120]   is going to take that pathway
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.760]   because that's the more well-trod path.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   That's the neurons that you've connected together
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.800]   to feel as good as possible.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.680]   And the way that you do that is really simple.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.560]   The next time that you feel a little bit of something good,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.520]   it could be, wow, this book's really interesting.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.160]   Wow, I'm really enjoying this conversation.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   It can be teeny tiny.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.200]   I love this sunset.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.480]   This flower smells great.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.960]   My dog is so cute today.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.000]   You sit in it for a little bit longer
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   than you normally would and you amplify that feeling.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.960]   You notice it, you amplify it, you sit in it.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.800]   That's all you're doing.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.600]   Oh my God, the bubbles in this Coke, yum.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.840]   Love it, so good, move on with your life.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.280]   - Does it have to be external or can you just--
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.960]   - No, internally, that's my,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.760]   I'm voicing my internal monologue here.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.480]   No, I love it because you can be doing it
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.560]   in a meeting at work.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   You could be doing it while you're talking to your spouse.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.360]   I sometimes have moments where I'm just overwhelmed
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.400]   with gratitude and appreciation for my husband.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.040]   And I mean, I probably should say that out loud, honestly,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.080]   'cause he'd probably appreciate it.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.000]   But I'll just sit in there and be like,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.800]   oh my God, I can't believe that if all the people
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.120]   in the world, I found you and I get to live my life with you
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.080]   and I'll sit in that feeling and I'll amplify it
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.920]   and I'll turn it up.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.840]   And that is literally on a biological level,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.440]   on a neurological level,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.600]   you are rewiring your neural pathways.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.680]   You are building them together to create the routes
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.260]   that you wanna take through that meadow.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.480]   So the next time it's gonna take those good pathways,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.720]   you're gonna feel so much better in your day-to-day life.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.080]   So look for the little opportunities.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.760]   The next time you feel anything good,
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.560]   mm, this ice cream is so delicious.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.840]   Sit in it, amplify it, and really, really savor
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.440]   that feeling so that you can rewire your neural pathways.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.680]   - I don't have a corporate job anymore,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.480]   but this feels like the perfect opportunity
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.360]   for one of those really big meetings
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.640]   where it's a total waste of time,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.600]   especially if you're in person.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.280]   Just stare at something in the room,
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.600]   think about something great.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.240]   You don't have to distract yourself with your phone
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.760]   and look like you're not paying attention.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.720]   - You took an example of something that's kind of boring
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.560]   that we all hate.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.520]   And the thing is that if you go in there
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.200]   with the neural pathways that you've wired
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.360]   towards stress, towards anger, towards bitterness,
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.120]   your brain will again take those pathways
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.640]   and you'll think, "Ugh, why are we having
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.480]   "these meetings again?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   "This is stupid, I hate this, I hate my job.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.240]   "Why aren't I Kim Kardashian at this point in my life?"
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.520]   But if you've wired your neural pathways
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.240]   to good by smelling your dog's fur,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.600]   sitting in that and savoring it.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.440]   My cat smells so good, let me tell you.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.560]   It's the best smell in the whole world.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.320]   I'm like, "I never bathed you once.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.360]   "How do you smell so good?"
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.400]   And I know what you eat.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.200]   - I'm laughing over here because my dog,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.880]   I don't think smells good almost ever,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.440]   except for some reason his ears smell like tortilla chips.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.680]   - All right, well, that's something.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.000]   But if you've done that by smelling your pet,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.200]   by hugging your partner, by eating the Mexican food,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.240]   the next time you go into that super boring meeting,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.280]   you wouldn't have to try.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.080]   You'll naturally think, "Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   "Or maybe this is an opportunity to share something
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.800]   "or learn something that I haven't shared before.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.560]   "Aren't I lucky to have this job?"
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.920]   Your brain will do that effortlessly in these moments
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.720]   that you would have otherwise tended towards negativity.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.560]   - There is one app I love so much.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.840]   I use it every day.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.720]   It's pinned to the dock on my computer
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.600]   and on my home screen on my phone.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.000]   I don't know what I would do without it
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.040]   because it's where I track my tasks,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.320]   manage this podcast, plan our trips,
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.760]   and basically manage everything else in our life.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.160]   The app is Notion, our sponsor today,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.960]   and I am such a huge fan.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.040]   Notion's basically an online workspace that's so incredible,
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.240]   it's replaced docs, task or project management software,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.880]   spreadsheets, and more.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.960]   And ever since they added Notion AI,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.560]   I've been saving so much time letting it do the tedious work
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.080]   so I can focus on the creative work.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.960]   Here's an example.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.320]   Whenever I'm doing some research,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.960]   I can put a bunch of thoughts into a page
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.440]   and ask Notion AI to help me fill it out,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.960]   tighten up the language, or even come up with other ideas.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.840]   Notion AI helps you work faster,
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.440]   write better, and think bigger,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.000]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.320]   And the best part is that the power of AI
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.960]   is built right into the product,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.040]   not a separate tool or browser tab
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.960]   you have to copy and paste between.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   Try Notion AI free when you go to notion.com/allthehacks.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.040]   That's lowercase letters, notion.com/allthehacks

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.160]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.280]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.520]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.040]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.400]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.840]   and protect our personal data.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.920]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.560]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.520]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.880]   When I first looked up our family,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.120]   there were hundreds of pieces of our personal info out there,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.280]   but thankfully, I started using Delete.me
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.920]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.880]   removed from the web,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.840]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.120]   for this episode.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.980]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.560]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.920]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.680]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.560]   and get that removed as well.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.280]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.240]   and on average, they find and remove
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.800]   over 2,000 pieces of personal data for a customer
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.680]   in their first two years.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.760]   When I first signed up, I was actually skeptical
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.920]   about needing a service on an ongoing basis,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.800]   but these data brokers are relentless,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.640]   and I've seen my personal data pop up
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.440]   again and again throughout the year,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.120]   so I love having a service
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.520]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.300]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.480]   So, if you wanna get your personal information
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.720]   removed from the web,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.560]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.000]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.800]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.100]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.040]   One of the things that I think can make you really unhappy
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.480]   is just having so much stuff going on in your mind
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.360]   and never feeling like you can actually catch up,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.520]   so I'm curious how we can start to offload
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.960]   some of that cognitive load.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.440]   - So, one of my favorite tricks in life,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.800]   this is from Annie Murphy-Paul.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.120]   She's a behavioral science writer,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.820]   and she studies essentially how we can use things
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.540]   outside of our brain, access outside of the brain thinking,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.420]   is what she calls it, to become smarter.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.700]   And then we can save our brain
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.340]   for the really special things that only our brain can do.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.140]   But if you sit back and you think about it for a second,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.860]   you're like, how much am I making my brain do
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.260]   that could easily be done by a computer program,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.260]   that could easily be done by a pad of paper and a pen?
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.180]   And so the idea behind cognitive offloading
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.580]   is taking all of those thoughts,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.900]   every single little possible thing in your brain
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.040]   that you don't need to be wasting
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.020]   your precious neural capacity on and offloading it
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.920]   so that you can save your beautiful, brilliant brain
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.040]   for the things that really matter.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.240]   So I cognitively offload everything.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.080]   I have Notion.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.400]   I use it for literally everything.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.560]   I have notes of things to talk about in therapy.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.960]   I have an ongoing grocery list that I share with my partner.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.240]   I have every single podcast episode
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.080]   that I ever wanna do in the future.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.720]   I have things that I wanna buy.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.080]   So I have everything on my Notion,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.320]   and I find that by not having to be like,
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.920]   wait, what did we need to add to the grocery list?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.520]   Or what was that podcast episode
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.740]   that I think I wanted to produce, but like, I don't know,
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.200]   I was gonna noodle on it for a while.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.960]   By taking all those thoughts out of my brain,
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.160]   my brain is freer to have the deep and exciting
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.960]   and interesting thoughts that I want it to have.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.320]   - So I'm gonna take a tiny segue
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.080]   and get your take on something I got in my inbox yesterday.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.360]   So there's a company called Rewind,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.400]   and what they basically do is it runs on a Mac
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.600]   and it just records everything
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   that's happening on your computer.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.480]   All the websites you visit, the Zoom meetings you're in.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.400]   There are some requirements in every state
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.380]   to disclose anything.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.320]   They pop up and say, do you wanna record this meeting?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.480]   So it'll record everything you're doing
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.320]   and then you can query it.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.920]   And you can be like, what website did I look at
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.960]   on last Friday?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.840]   You can search the text on everything on your screen.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.680]   - Wow.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.220]   - So we can all agree that maybe that has a use case,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.160]   but here's the crazy thing.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.040]   They sent me an email, I'm not in any beta program,
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.280]   but they're like, do you wanna pre-order this product?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.560]   It's called the Rewind Pendant.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.200]   And it is a necklace with a microphone
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.120]   that does the same thing in person.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.260]   So you can completely cognitively offload everything
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.680]   and say, go to a conference, wear this thing all the time
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.560]   and say, what did I talk to that person about
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.400]   at this conference?
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.220]   - Wow.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.680]   - I'm very curious to get your take.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.900]   This is the first time I've actually gotten
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.740]   anyone else's opinion on it.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.360]   - That is so interesting.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.680]   - On one hand, cognitively offload everything.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.520]   And on the other hand, kind of creepy.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.100]   - For me, I wanna cognitively offload the parts
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.520]   that aren't human interactions
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.720]   so I can enjoy the human interactions more.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.560]   So I think that's where my ick would come in with it.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.120]   The point of cognitive offloading
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.880]   is to focus my brain in the directions
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.700]   that I wanna focus it.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.380]   And not have it be occupied by the things
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.160]   that I don't want it to be occupied by.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.280]   And the thing I want it to be occupied by
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.560]   is human interaction.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.420]   And I think that the fear would be that this device
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.720]   would make me want to not spend as much of my energy
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   or attention on that.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   - I was very torn.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.020]   The thing that I like, which I'm not sure I like enough
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.360]   to actually outweigh all the problems,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.840]   is just sometimes I get really into a conversation.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.660]   I have a wonderful conversation with someone.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.020]   And then later, I wanna come back to it and be like,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.540]   oh, I really enjoyed talking to you about this.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.320]   But it was at a conference and it's two days later.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.640]   And I couldn't remember a thing.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.480]   And there are some people who naturally remember.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.760]   Some people who leave each meeting
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.200]   and they write down like six notes
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.860]   about the conversation they have.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.240]   Which for me is the exact opposite.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.580]   It's like I just took myself away
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.160]   from the moment I love to take notes.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   And this would do it for you.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.720]   Using the one on my computer,
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   the software this company Rewind makes,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.760]   has saved me in like 10 different ways
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.920]   that are all relatively minor.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.760]   But I think we've all written something,
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   whether we filled out a form,
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.600]   whether it was writing something that didn't save.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.440]   And then you close the window or close the tab
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.520]   and you go back and it's gone.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.120]   - What are they doing for storage?
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.820]   - It's just all locally stored on your computer.
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.720]   - Does it self erase every week?
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   - You can choose, but I think I had mine set for seven days.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.200]   And 90% of the use cases I've had for it
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.920]   were not let me query something from 10 weeks ago.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.200]   This is a strange example,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.680]   but I was setting up auto insurance with USAA.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   And they were like, you're gonna get this special price
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.720]   if you bundle home and auto and add on this policy.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.240]   And then once I did it all,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.680]   I was like, hey, I didn't see the discounts.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.520]   And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.920]   They're just gonna come in three weeks.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.960]   And I was like, well, what are they gonna be?
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   And she's like, well, you just have to wait and see.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.400]   I was like, no, no, no, you told me, but I can't go back.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.120]   And then I was like, oh, I looked at it yesterday.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.360]   Rewind, take a screenshot.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.660]   Now I have it saved. - Wow.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.760]   - Let's go into relationships
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.480]   'cause we started getting there and I got excited
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.080]   because this was the one that I said
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.920]   I wanted to come back to because it's top of mind for me.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.680]   Building deeper relationships,
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.320]   especially with the people that matter,
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.160]   becomes such a different challenge and priority in life
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.040]   after, in my case, having children
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.880]   because you just don't have time.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.640]   You don't have time for all the relationships.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.680]   And it almost feels like work to keep up with some people
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.560]   that you wanna keep up with.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.920]   I have one thing I'll share at some point,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.480]   but I'm curious how you think about this broadly
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.560]   in terms of picking who to spend time with
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.200]   and deepening those relationships.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.720]   - So the first thing that I would say
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.840]   is even by identifying that you're excited
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.720]   to talk about relationships, you're winning.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.880]   I think a lot of us in the world today
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.520]   have failed to identify community and relationships
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.680]   as a critical part of happiness, of our health,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.040]   of the way that we live our lives
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.560]   that will lead to satisfaction and success.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.240]   Relationships are at the core of almost every single thing
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.080]   that we do.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.840]   And we act like they're an afterthought.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.720]   We act like, "Oh, if I get through my busy day,
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.400]   "if I accomplish all my tasks for work,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.440]   "if I do all my health hacks, whatever,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.960]   "if I finish everything that I need to do on my to-do list,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.080]   "then I can have time to socialize
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.760]   "and to spend with the people that I love."
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.560]   And I almost think that we need to be flipping that equation.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.080]   If you need to take away some of your other health habits
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.040]   to preserve your relationships, to create that time,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.800]   I would say that's probably worth it,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.960]   at least some of the time, because research shows,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   this is research from Dr. Robert Waldinger.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.760]   He ran one of the longest studies of longevity and happiness
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.200]   and essentially living a thriving life.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.160]   It is an 80-year-plus study about what makes a good life.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.600]   And at the end of the day, the one-liner is
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.400]   that the relationships that we form are the bedrock,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.880]   the foundation of what a good life looks like.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.360]   So good relationships are gonna make us live longer.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.960]   They're gonna lower our stress levels.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.240]   They're gonna make us excited to wake up every single day.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.640]   They are the single most important thing.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.440]   And again, we treat it like an afterthought.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.760]   So one of the first things that I would recommend
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.600]   to anybody is to just switch that priority level.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.120]   I think we are really focused
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.680]   on what supplements should I be taking?
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.760]   How can I optimize my workout routine?
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.120]   Do I need to go do a sauna or a cold plunge?
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   Things that are trendy.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.840]   And we should be thinking, when was the last time
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.560]   that I saw somebody that I loved in person?
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.480]   When was the last time that I called this friend?
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.160]   When was the last time that instead of scrolling
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.440]   social media, I had a real human interaction
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.640]   that was really satisfying?
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.280]   And moving that, again, to the top of the priority list.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.200]   In terms of figuring out which people are worth your time
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.680]   and are worth you focusing your very limited space
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.280]   that you have each day on, I think I'd ask myself,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.240]   what are the things that you're looking for
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.320]   in your relationships right now?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.000]   So I think I hear from a lot of new parents,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.320]   like, I'm having a hard time connecting with my friends,
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.760]   but the friends that you're trying to connect with
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.520]   are people who wanna go out.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.160]   They wanna maybe meet a partner.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.880]   They're just in a different space in their life.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.680]   And you're creating this cognitive dissonance
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.600]   between what your goals are and the things
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.840]   that you're trying to do at that moment are
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.000]   and what their goals are.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.320]   And that can lead to some friction in a relationship.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.360]   So I think the first thing is,
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.480]   what are you looking to get
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.040]   out of your relationships right now?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.440]   And who are the people that can naturally
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.720]   tend towards giving you those things?
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.880]   - One of the challenges I find,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.000]   and I don't know if maybe I need
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.720]   the energy hacks first to get here.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.080]   The conversation often just divulges very quickly
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.520]   into the same thing you end up talking about with everyone,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   and you don't really get to go deep with anyone.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   So I meet a lot of people at the park,
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.000]   and it's just like, oh, how old are your kids?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.840]   What are they doing?
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.040]   It's that conversation.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.800]   What tips do you have for people
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.200]   that wanna go deeper earlier and kind of understand,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.840]   is this a person that I could have
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.160]   a long-term connection with?
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.200]   And I'm not talking romantic.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.960]   I'm talking about random friends in the neighborhood,
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.920]   people you might hang out with on the weekend.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.560]   How do you take someone who you think
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.960]   you could have a meaningful relationship with
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.680]   in a completely platonic friendship way and go deep?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.800]   So there's amazing research
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.080]   from a woman named Dr. Marissa G. Franco,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.240]   and she is a friendship psychologist.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.280]   And her research shows that the more vulnerable we are,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.000]   we think people are gonna like us less.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.440]   We're gonna think people are gonna get the ick.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.560]   They're gonna be like, I don't wanna engage with this.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.640]   But in fact, the more vulnerable we are,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.040]   the more people are going to like us, period.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.880]   So if you're at the playground and somebody's like,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.040]   oh, how old's your kid, whatever,
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.680]   you could say, wow, this was a really exciting week.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.320]   My kid hit this milestone.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.880]   I did this work thing that I never thought was possible.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.040]   You can be vulnerable in a good direction.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.320]   You can also say, it's been a really tough week.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   I've been feeling a lot of anxiety.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.200]   I'm still struggling to learn how to deal with this.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.880]   You can open up in a way that's gonna push the conversation
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.840]   and the direction of vulnerability,
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.720]   giving them something to connect to.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.280]   We think, again, that it's gonna turn people away from us,
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.680]   but it's actually gonna pull them into us.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.360]   I'm also a huge fan of putting a little bit
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.280]   of intentionality into our gatherings.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.960]   I did a podcast episode with Priya Parker
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.560]   who wrote a beautiful book about the art of gathering.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   And it was about how when we come together as a community,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.000]   by putting a little bit of intentionality behind that,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.200]   we can get so much more out of that.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.240]   So again, it's like leaning into the things
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.600]   that people find cringy,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.800]   whether it's a conversation starter, a prompt saying,
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.760]   I don't wanna have the same conversation over and over.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.600]   Just putting a little bit of intentionality
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.320]   behind the gathering in the first place,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.600]   I think can be really helpful.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.280]   I love organized fun.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.960]   I love any type of getting together
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.880]   where there's a little bit of structure to it,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.200]   because I do think we're all sick
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.680]   of having the same conversation over and over.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.240]   I genuinely think everybody is,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.720]   and often just acknowledging that and saying,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.640]   look, I have this conversation starter deck,
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.240]   or I'm really sick of talking about the weather.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.880]   And honestly, maybe you even say,
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.480]   I'm sick of talking about my kids right now.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.560]   I love my kids so much,
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.400]   but I'd rather talk about anything else.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.920]   What was a vacation you went on
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.640]   that you last really enjoyed?
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.800]   What's your dream vacation?
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.480]   You can pull stuff out of the blue
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.320]   if you have the vulnerability to admit
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.440]   you're not happy with the status quo in the first place.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.280]   - I really like that.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.440]   I think we both interviewed Vanessa Van Edwards,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.600]   who has some good tips here of jumping into a conversation
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.360]   and not saying, what do you do for work,
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.400]   but what's something awesome that happened at work this week
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.520]   or come up with some ideas and just be intentional about it.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.080]   - We all wanna talk about something new
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.000]   and acknowledging the elephant in the room
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.280]   gives you so much permission to be like,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   oh, I heard this great question on a podcast,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.920]   or I read this conversation starter
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.800]   in an email newsletter that I got the other day.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.960]   What do you think of this?
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.280]   - You have this tip in the book.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.040]   I think Vanessa shared it on our episode.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.760]   I've heard it from a lot of people at Negotiating.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.280]   Building a deeper rapport,
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.040]   whether it's a friendship or even in work,
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.600]   listening is also the key.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.200]   There's so many ways that we can be generous
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.680]   with our attention.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.600]   And we focus so often on being the entertainer,
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.360]   but what people actually want
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.960]   is for us to be present with them.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.640]   - How many times have you been in a conversation
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.360]   where you think you're having a conversation,
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.920]   but they're just waiting for you to stop talking
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.840]   so they can say the thing that they were gonna say?
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.960]   And everybody knows that feeling and it sucks.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.120]   They're not thinking like, wow,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.160]   they gave a really sparkling response to what I said.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.760]   You're thinking like, you weren't listening to me.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.200]   That feels really bad.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.640]   - Being an incredibly attentive listener
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.440]   is genuinely one of the best gifts you can give somebody.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.040]   It makes them like you more.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.080]   Even if you need to take a second
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.120]   when they finish talking and say,
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.400]   huh, that was really interesting.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.600]   I'm gonna think about my response for a second.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.840]   That's not the end of the world.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   It's actually often really appreciated.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.560]   I also think in terms of reactions,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.000]   thinking about how you're reacting to people too.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.160]   I have a tip in the book
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.960]   about how we can have more fun in our lives.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.520]   This is from Catherine Price.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.400]   We did an entire episode about how to create more fun,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.640]   how to be a fun magnet,
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.840]   the type of person that everybody always thinks
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.760]   is really fun and wants to be around.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.160]   And one of the best hacks for that is to be quick to laugh.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.400]   And I love it because it is so simple
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.520]   and it's not fake laughing.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.880]   It's just leaning into the moments where you're entertained
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   and being generous with your laughter.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.120]   And we can all remember those times when we go out
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.000]   and we feel like we're the funniest person in the world.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.400]   And like, how good does it feel to be around those people
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.440]   who make us feel like that?
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.000]   Those are the people that you want to invite out
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.360]   over and over and they haven't entertained you.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.800]   They haven't danced on a table.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.280]   They haven't told a really witty joke.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.760]   They've laughed when you've said funny things.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.440]   But those are the people that we want to be around.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.280]   - I love this.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.120]   I feel like I need to be more intentional
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.480]   about laughing without being fake.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.320]   - Without being fake.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.040]   But I think there's so many opportunities
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.840]   and one, you won't catch them if you're not listening,
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.040]   if you're not paying attention.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.760]   But two, we almost hold ourselves back
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.800]   from feeling and expressing those emotions.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.520]   And they're one of the most beautiful gifts
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.120]   that we can give other people.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.280]   So wait, I want to ask you,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.600]   what are your relationship challenges?
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.320]   Like either in your romantic relationship,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.120]   in your friendship, can we dive into some
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.720]   of your particular problems?
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.200]   And I can see if I have a tip for that.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.640]   - We moved into this new neighborhood.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.840]   I have some friends in the neighborhood
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.040]   and we have very limited time 'cause we have kids
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.760]   and all of the friends that I was the closest with
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   have dispersed around the country.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.320]   I remember when we moved in, I asked my wife,
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.560]   I was like, do you think it would be weird
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.400]   if we wrote a postcard that was like,
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.560]   hey, we're Chris and Amy.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.200]   We have these kids and we live on this block in town
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.720]   and we like doing these random things.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.560]   And yeah, it's really weird if we wrote this postcard
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.400]   and dropped it in your mailbox so you can just rip it up.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.520]   But if you read this and you're like,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.080]   these people seem like they'd be cool to hang out.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.160]   Why don't you shoot me an email?
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.120]   And I was like- - Did you do it?
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.320]   - No, no, we didn't do it.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.200]   - I feel like the answer, especially in the context
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.160]   of forming relationships and friendships to,
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.120]   do you think it'd be weird if, is always like,
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.840]   no, it's not weird, just do it.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.920]   I have this theory, it's about friendship and dating,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   but it's called match theory.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.760]   And the idea is that if you go on a date,
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.320]   if you're meeting a new person in your life,
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.000]   the sooner that you're wholly yourself,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.600]   the better off you'll be because even if you don't connect
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.680]   with them, that's valuable information to have
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.120]   and you have it sooner rather than later.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.920]   If you're dressing a way you wouldn't dress on a date,
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.960]   if you're play acting in a different way,
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.440]   you're like, oh, I'm trying to impress them.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.280]   You're not helping the ultimate goal,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.880]   which is to find a match for yourself.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.360]   So by you and Amy going out there
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.400]   and being unabashedly weird,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.960]   you're gonna meet the people who wanna make friends,
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.200]   who are putting themselves out there,
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.760]   which are gonna be more likely to be your type of people.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.400]   - I think Amy and I had a little disconnect
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.640]   on whether that was like her personality or mine
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   shining through in these random postcards.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.920]   But I think that was the thing.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.320]   This applies to relationships, both your partner and not.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.200]   I think so often people hang on to people
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.600]   that they think are the right person,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.080]   not thinking there's another person
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.680]   or their best friend set.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.800]   It's like, this is my best friend since so long ago,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.640]   they have to still be my best friend.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.080]   I am convinced that within maybe a quarter mile,
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.160]   there are like five couples that could be our best friends.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.960]   And I'm trying to figure out how do I find them?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.080]   I remember telling my wife when Bumble, the dating app,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.720]   launched this service called BFF.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.000]   It's like a dating app for finding your friends.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.960]   But I just remember thinking that felt like
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.120]   such a strange thing, but it also makes total sense.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.880]   - So many people are lonely and we all assume
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.760]   everybody else has their friend group sorted.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.000]   We're the only person feeling the way that we're feeling.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.440]   And so we deny ourselves the opportunity
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.000]   to put ourselves out there to like form these relationships.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.960]   But over and over again,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.040]   I have a community of over a million people
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.320]   that I hear from constantly.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.360]   And the refrain is, why does everybody else
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.400]   have this sorted when I don't have this sorted?
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.080]   But if everybody is saying that,
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.840]   then everybody else doesn't have it sorted.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.160]   So I think first of all,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.360]   acknowledging that this is a real societal issue
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.720]   that's happening and it's happening all over to everybody
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.320]   and using that as like deep permission giving
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.040]   is so, so, so helpful.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.360]   - So you're saying I should make the cards?
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.760]   - I definitely think you should make the cards.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.600]   I do.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.440]   It was interesting what you said that you think
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.720]   that we hold on to these old relationships.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.640]   And I do think that there's a truth to the fact
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.840]   that we often gravitate towards people that we meet
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.960]   later in our life or more recently in our life
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.840]   because they reflect the person that we feel we are
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.160]   at the moment back to us.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.040]   And we want to be reflected as the person
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.960]   that we are at that moment.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.040]   We don't want our childhood self, our teenage self,
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.920]   our college self reflected back on us
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.840]   because we feel like we've grown and evolved
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.280]   and changed so much since being that person.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.400]   So this is one of my favorite tips in the book.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.560]   And I feel like it's a little bit underappreciated as a tip.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.920]   So I wanna spotlight it for a second,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   but it's to let the people that you love
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.160]   change in front of you all of the time.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.120]   To go to the people that you love
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.160]   with a fresh perspective as often as possible.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.240]   So this could look like,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.560]   hey, I know that you didn't like this food.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.120]   Do you still not like this type of food
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.560]   or do you wanna give it a try?
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.440]   This could look like,
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.800]   oh, I know you didn't like reading this type of book
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.400]   when we were first dating.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.760]   Is that still true?
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.840]   We don't allow the people in our lives to change
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.760]   while we're on this path towards change.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.240]   And it doesn't make any sense.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.960]   And so I think that sometimes we can turn
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.080]   those old relationships into really satisfying relationships
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.160]   in the present by allowing for that evolution in each other.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.080]   - Can the opposite happen?
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.600]   Can you realize that this person that in high school
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.840]   I was best friends with,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.400]   we said we were gonna be friends forever.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.240]   It's not the right thing.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.680]   Are you saying let it evolve and bring it back?
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.520]   - I think there's both.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.360]   So first of all,
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.600]   I'm a huge fan of at the point that you think
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.240]   a relationship might be over,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.440]   have a conversation about what you would need
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.680]   from that relationship to have it not be over
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.320]   because at that point you have nothing to lose.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.800]   Like if you're about to cut somebody out of your life
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.640]   or just stop hanging out with them or ghost them
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.680]   or whatever, like scale back entirely,
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.120]   you have nothing to lose by saying,
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.320]   "Hey, Paul, I don't really wanna talk about high school
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.160]   whenever we hang out."
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.400]   Or, "Hey, Paul, I'm not really in a hanging out at the bar
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.200]   and drinking beer phase of my life.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.920]   I would really love if you would come over
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.480]   and play with my kids and we could sing Disney songs."
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.720]   And then even if Paul is like, "That sounds awful.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.680]   I'm not interested in that."
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.640]   You've lost nothing.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.280]   And there's a chance that Paul would be like,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.680]   "Oh my gosh, I know every single word
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.880]   to the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.640]   and nobody has asked me to sing it."
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.560]   So I do think that having that conversation
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   can have some really powerful results
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.800]   that we would not expect.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.080]   And if you have nothing to lose,
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.560]   you have everything to gain by having that conversation.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.480]   And then two, I'm not a fan of cutting people out,
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.160]   but I am a fan of changing their position in my life.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.000]   And I think that this can be really important,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.280]   especially when you're somebody with limited time.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.920]   Instead of Paul being somebody you're really prioritizing,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.960]   maybe Paul becomes,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.200]   "I see them at the Christmas gathering," friend.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.760]   Maybe somebody goes from being
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.080]   middle of the night secret friend
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.400]   to, "I go to yoga with them," friend.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.760]   And I think being clear with ourselves
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.400]   about our expectations
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.080]   and what we're getting out of each friendship
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.920]   can be really helpful.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.480]   And so sometimes moving people along in those places
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.720]   can be a way to not cut them out entirely,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.880]   but to have them have a more right-sized presence
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.720]   in our life.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.280]   - Okay, I feel like this has been awesome.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.120]   One of the things I loved
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.480]   is the way you described the book wasn't,
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.520]   "You need to read all 100.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.840]   You need to do all of these right away."
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.200]   So I already feel like I have a slate of things to work on,
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.280]   and I feel like I've got some next steps,
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.720]   and it's not the book that you've read millions of times
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.600]   that leaves you unaware of what's next and feeling stuck.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.560]   So thank you.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.920]   Thanks for the conversation.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.040]   Where can people go?
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.680]   - So the book is called "100 Ways to Change Your Life."
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.200]   You can find it wherever books are sold
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   or on 100waystochangerlife.com.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.760]   Like you said, it is not a book
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.720]   that you need to consume in its entirety.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.640]   It's a great book for while your pasta water is boiling,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.960]   and you don't wanna just pick up your phone
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.440]   and scroll on social media again.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.840]   You can pick it up and read a tip,
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.560]   and you get a really satisfying experience
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.400]   in that five-minute interstitial period, which I love.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   And it's a book that you can reference again and again
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.600]   as your needs and your goals change throughout your life.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.720]   One of the first tips in the book
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.200]   is about figuring out your needs, your goals,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.760]   and how you're going to measure success
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.280]   in terms of those needs and goals.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.800]   I think that's hugely important
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.040]   so that we don't end up with a ton of habits
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   filling our day that we don't even know why they're there.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.920]   And then I have a podcast called "The Liz Moody Podcast,"
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.320]   which you have been a guest on, a great, great episode.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.480]   So if you wanna hear a little bit more from Chris Hutchins,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   definitely go look for the Chris Hutchins episode
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.640]   of "The Liz Moody Podcast."
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.200]   But essentially, we take science,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.920]   we make it really fun and interesting to listen to,
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.880]   and then we're really focused on those action tips.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.840]   How are we applying the science to our everyday lives
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.160]   to feel the way that we wanna feel every single day?
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.400]   So that's "The Liz Moody Podcast,"
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.520]   wherever you listen to podcasts.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.960]   And then if you're a social media person,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.120]   I'm @LizMoody on TikTok and Instagram.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.920]   - It's easy, Liz Moody everywhere.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.560]   Definitely check all of that out.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.400]   Thank you so much for being here in person.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.800]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.080]   - While it is a bit more work
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.560]   doing these in-person interviews,
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.360]   it's been really fun to get a chance
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.440]   to meet some of my guests face-to-face.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.200]   I hope you enjoyed this conversation.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.840]   I know I did, and I know I have a few takeaways from it
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.040]   that I'm gonna start putting into action already.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.720]   If you have questions for an upcoming "Mailbag" episode,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.360]   podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.000]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.200]   I will see you next week.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.320]   (upbeat music fades)
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.080]   (birds chirping)
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:08.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
