[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The twelfth verse in the first chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   "For the rich cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.440]   whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.400]   unto him against that day." Now I'm calling attention to this text for the fifth time,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.880]   as many and most indeed who are here this evening will recall. And again, I am constrained to say
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:46.680]   that if we are to understand this statement truly and to gather from it the lesson that is intended
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   for us, it is essential that we should take it in its context. The apostle is writing to this young
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   man, Timothy, one of his own disciples, a young minister, but a man who by temperament was rather
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   given to depression, always ready to see the difficulties and the dark side of everything,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.720]   and always ready to be cast down as a consequence. And he was in trouble in particular because the
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.600]   great apostle was in prison. He was in the hands of that most capricious of all the Roman emperors,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.640]   the Emperor Nero. And Timothy knew therefore full well that at any moment the great apostle might be
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.280]   put to death, and he couldn't just face this. How could the churches go on? How could he go on
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.520]   without this mighty man of God? He's in trouble because of the imprisonment of the great apostle.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.360]   Very well, then, that's the background. So the apostle writes to him like this. He says,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.960]   "God hath not given unto us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be thou
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God, who hath saved us, and called
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.200]   us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.040]   appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   to light through the gospel, whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   teacher of the Gentiles, for the which cause also I suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.240]   ashamed, for I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.360]   that day. Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.720]   in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed unto thee by the Holy Ghost, keep,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.800]   keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. Very well. Now then, all that is necessary for this
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.480]   reason. Here in this twelfth verse the apostle makes this grand assertion, this mighty and moving
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.280]   asseveration, though he is in prison, and though he may be put to death at any moment, all is well,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.880]   he is not ashamed, by which he means rarely that he is filled with the spirit of rejoicing. This
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.440]   is meiosis or litotes, whichever you prefer. It is the use of a negative to convey a positive.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.640]   I am not ashamed means I am perfectly happy, I am rejoicing, all is well with my soul. Now,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.360]   I say this is just the real central message of what Christianity, the Christian faith,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:04.280]   rarely offers us. You see, this is a way of life. This isn't some theoretical philosophy. This is a
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.920]   way of life. The claim that we make for this message, this gospel, is that it enables us to
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:18.000]   live. It enables us to be more than conquerors. It enables us to meet every possibility, every
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   eventuality, anything that can come to meet us, even death itself, and still smile at it, go on,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.280]   triumphantly more than conquerors. Now that's what the apostle is saying here. He says that's
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.120]   why I am Timothy, you ought to be the same, you can be the same. So I say that is still the
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.200]   Christian message. And never was it more needed than it is in this uncertain world in which we
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.160]   find ourselves tonight. We're in a world we never know what tomorrow is going to bring forth. Indeed,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   there are learned scientists who would have us believe that we are probably living in the last
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   few years of civilization and of life as it has been known for so many centuries. Well,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.080]   the question then is how do we face all this? And here I am suggesting is the only ultimate
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   answer. There is no other answer. There are things that can interest us for a while,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.200]   there are things that can help us temporarily. But when you face the ultimate, our contention
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.960]   is that there is nothing which can really finally help us. Very well then, that leaves us with this
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.440]   great question. What was it that helped the apostle? And this is the thing that we are so
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.040]   concerned about. The apostle was like this not because he happened to be that sort of man. It
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.720]   isn't a matter of temperament or makeup or psychology, isn't it? Thank God it isn't. If
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   ever a man was a depressed type by nature, it was the apostle Paul. There's no question about that.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.160]   He tells us that in many places he's the man who suffered from "fightings without and fears
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.840]   within." That's Paul by nature. And here you see he tells this depressed type Timothy that he
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.200]   needn't be like that, that he can get out of it and rejoice even as the apostle was. Thank God.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.080]   It's not a gospel only for certain people. There's no greater fallacy than that. It is
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   something that is offered to all, whatever they may be. Very well, it isn't temperament and it
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.240]   isn't, I say, that he'd adopted one of the current philosophies, either Stoicism or Epicureanism or
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.040]   any one of them, because all those are finally hopeless. And they can't make a man sing,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   they can't make a man exult, they can't make him rejoice in tribulations as the apostle was doing
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.640]   in prison at that present time. Well, what is it then? Well, the answer is quite simple. The
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.680]   apostle's whole case is that he is what he is and is able to live as he is living and to react even
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:01.400]   to prison and the possibility of death, simply and solely because he believes the gospel. No
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:10.200]   other reason at all. It is simply his belief of this Christian gospel. So that, I'm putting it
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.840]   to you, that the most important thing for us in this life and in this world is to discover what
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:23.080]   this gospel is. And here, of course, there is all this modern trouble. It's been before, but it's
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.520]   acute at the present time. Can we know what the gospel is? The notorious school of teaching tells
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:38.880]   us that we can't, that you can't define the gospel, can't tell what it tells. And there are others who
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.840]   tell us that you need a different gospel for every generation, and that we need a special one in this
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.960]   generation because we are men grown up, we are the atomic age people, we are the scientific people,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.720]   so we need a new message, and it isn't like the old one, and so on. I don't want to wear you with
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.520]   all that again, but it's important we should bear it in mind. For the answer to the apostle is this,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:09.680]   that of course we can know what the gospel is. There is only one gospel. The apostle says in
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   writing to the Galatians, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.960]   that which we have preached, let him be accursed." Here he exhorts Timothy, "O fast the form of sound
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.600]   words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." In the next chapter,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.680]   in verse 8, he says, "Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:47.200]   according to my gospel." My gospel. And when he says my gospel, he means the only one. The other
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   apostles preached exactly the same gospel. Paul is at pains to say that again to the Galatians
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.160]   and to the Corinthians. There was no quarrel amongst the apostles. Peter went astray for a
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.520]   moment, but he came back, and the apostle was able to remind them that he was departing from
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.920]   the common faith. There is a common salvation, a common faith, the faith once and forever delivered
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.160]   to the saints. And if it's been once and forever delivered, what on earth does it matter that this
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   happens to be the 20th century? This is a revelation from God. This isn't human reason.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   This isn't man making discoveries. God, as the apostle says here, has revealed this. Listen,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.160]   "He has saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.200]   to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:50.720]   but is now made manifest." That's it. And it has been made manifest once and forever. There is
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.120]   only one gospel. How long is this world going to last? I don't know. If it lasts a thousand years,
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.320]   there'll be no new gospel. There'll be no need of one. This idea that modern man needs a new
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:10.280]   message is a denial of the whole of the gospel. Modern man, who is he? Is he so much better than
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.600]   all who have gone before him? Is he more moral? Does he never commit adultery? Does he not commit
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.360]   fornication? Does he never get drunk? Is he not mad enough to build atomic bombs? Modern man,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:28.600]   so marvelous that he needs a new message. Does he? The problem is still how to live,
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:39.280]   how to die, how to face God in the judgment, how to contemplate eternity. That's the problem still,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.920]   and the gospel still has the same answer. So thank God. There need be no uncertainty about
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.600]   this gospel. I know nothing in this pulpit apart from what I find here. The Apostle says to Timothy,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.640]   "Hold fast that form of sound words," and these are the only words that I've got,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.160]   the very thing that he expands in this paragraph. But you see, the point I am establishing is this.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:10.800]   You will only know the comfort and the consolation and the strength and the power of this message if
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.360]   you believe it as a whole. You can't get any of the benefits of Christianity without believing
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.880]   the doctrines of the Christian faith. Now there's another modern fallacy. You know,
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.040]   we've had people, haven't we, in our own lifetime since the war, in fact. I remember a great man,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.000]   some of you may have heard him in an interview on the television. He'd been a local preacher when he
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.600]   was a young man and making his career, but now he's become a great man and he's no longer a
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.840]   local preacher. But so he's questioned about his religion. "Ah, well, yes, of course," he said,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.680]   "Oh yes, yes, I still hold on to the Christian ethic. Of course, I don't believe the doctrines
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.000]   any longer," he said. He doesn't believe the doctrines, he's become too wise for that. He's
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.720]   become a great man. "But I still hold on to the Christian ethic." There's only one answer to that.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.880]   No man can practice the Christian ethic unless he believes the Christian doctrine and has the power
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   that results from doing that. It's impossible. The modern world is as it is because our foolish
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.760]   forefathers, I mean now our own fathers and partly our grandfathers, they began to think
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:26.320]   about the middle of the last century, that you could hold on to all the benefits of Christianity,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:33.560]   but at the same time deny its doctrines. See, science began to come in, in 1859, Darwin's
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.840]   Origin of Species and all that accompanied that. And they said, "Well, of course, we can't any
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.480]   longer believe in miracles. We can't believe in the virgin birth and in the miracles performed
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.840]   by Christ and things like that. Of course, we know with our knowledge we can't do that. But
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.360]   of course, we still want the benefits of Christianity." And you see, this 20th century
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:00.160]   of ours is proving that you cannot have the benefits of Christianity if you shed its doctrines. We'd
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.800]   like to, but you just can't do it because all the benefits come out of the doctrine. The life is the
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.520]   result of the belief. These two things are inexorably bound together and you can never
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:20.160]   divorce them. Now, the Apostle, you see, is saying all that here. He says he is persuaded. That's why
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.920]   he's not ashamed, because he's persuaded. "I am as I am," he says, "because I am persuaded of the
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   truth of what I believe." You see, it is therefore essential that we should believe the truth. We'll
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.560]   never know the experience until we believe the truth. Of course, I am here and ready to admit
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.000]   that you can have false experiences. There are many agencies that can give you false experiences.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.480]   I've known a thing like Christian science even give people a temporary happiness. I've never
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.440]   known it help anybody to die, but I've known it make people happy for the time being. And
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.680]   many another cult. And indeed, drugs can do it, alcohol can do it. Many things can give you
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.360]   temporary happiness. But we are not interested in temporary happiness. We are interested, I say again,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:16.000]   in life and death and eternity. And here, this is the only thing that can really help us. Therefore,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.800]   we must believe the doctrine. That's what Paul is exhorting Timothy to do. He says, "You are as you
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.240]   are, Timothy, because you are not clear about your doctrine. You're evidently thinking that it all
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.600]   depends upon me, Paul. But it doesn't depend upon me. It's the power of God and men. Don't look at
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   me. Get back to your doctrine. Get back to your foundation. You won't be right. You won't succeed
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:47.160]   until you're clear about the truth." I have to say exactly the same thing this night. What is it that
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.880]   enables the men to triumph over life and death as this apostle was able to do? Well, I've been
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:03.600]   beginning to tell you the answer to that question. You start, you see, with God. You don't start with
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.840]   your problem, you start with the universe. You start with the world. When I say to myself,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   "Why am I in trouble?" Well, I then must say this to myself. Who am I? What am I? Where have I come
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.920]   from? I'm in this world. I'm in trouble in this world. But what is the world? Where's the world
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:29.160]   come from? You see, you can't meet life and death and all these attendant problems until you are
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.960]   clear about this great question that's at the back of all. And here the apostle is clear, the whole
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:44.240]   Bible is clear. You have no hope until you start with this proposition. In the beginning, God. This
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:52.480]   is God's world. He made it, he created it. And thank God there is a purpose for it. This world
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:59.680]   is not a place of madness. This is not a world of utter confusion. This is not accident and chance.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:07.760]   And it's so wrong to say that there's no end and object in it all. There is. God made it, God set
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   it going. He made the world, established the time process. He began it, he's going to end it. All
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   is under the control of God. There's the first proposition. Now, if a man doesn't accept that,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:25.360]   he will never know discomfort and consolation. Never. It's impossible. You see, you start with
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:34.040]   God. Then, as we've seen, you come to men. What is man? How vital a question this is. Is man only
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   an animal? Well, if man is only an animal, there's no harm in his living as he is today, the life of
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.840]   a farmyard. If man's an animal, there's nothing wrong in promiscuity. There's nothing wrong in
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.600]   all lusts and desires and giving way to any immediate passion that comes. It's all right.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:59.280]   That's natural. That's man, if that is man. But you see, the Apostle has told us, "I am persuaded
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.120]   that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him." What is it? My soul. Man is a living
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:15.080]   soul. Thus the word to dust returners was not spoken of the soul. Man's not only an animal,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.720]   not even a reasoning animal. He's made in the image and likeness of God, and he's meant for
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:26.680]   God and communion with God and for eternity. That's man. Very well. But now you see,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:34.760]   here is man in trouble. And we've seen that he's in trouble because of the evil power that
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:42.440]   persuaded him to rebel against God, the devil, the God of this world, the evil fossils. Man is
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:49.680]   a slave of sin and evil and of the devil. And here he is. He's overpowered, he's over mastered,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.920]   he can't fight them. He's been trying to. The whole story of civilization is the struggle of
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:01.000]   men against evil and against the devil. I'm not here to detract from the glory of the achievement.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.800]   A man who says anything against Greek philosophy or poetry is a fool. It was a noble attempt,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:15.400]   but it failed. As I pointed out before, these great civilizations, go and visit Athens. What
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:23.640]   will you see? You will see the glory that was Greece. Not that is, but that was. They've all
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:30.000]   come to the same end. They've never succeeded. They can't succeed. Oh, reasoning, thinking,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.800]   philosophy, civilization, it can't solve the problem of men. Neither can your world religions.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   They're all profoundly pessimistic. They're all negative. They have no real hope, except that we
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:52.000]   be lost in some absorption into the eternal, the absolute. No hope. Man's individuality,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.280]   lost in some of them. Man's only hope in a series of reincarnations is another. And so,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.720]   on you go. Look back to the past, says Confucius. Worship your forefathers. It's the past that's
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.040]   great. Let's try and get back to it. Now, there they are in all their utter and profound hopelessness
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.000]   and despair. Well, then, is there no hope? Well, my dear friend, this is it. You see,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.800]   this is the whole point of preaching the gospel. I have to spend that time on the negative for
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:25.120]   this reason, that I know that no man has ever come to Christ until he has had to. I didn't
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.360]   come to Christ till I had to. Nobody's ever come to Christ till he's had to. We are all so proud,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.120]   self-satisfied, self-confident. We think we can do it. And it's only when we are miserable failures
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:47.400]   and cast in the dust, I lay in dust, life's glory dead. It's only then that there blossoms from the
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:54.880]   ground this blessed hope for us. So, you see, when we see our utter hopelessness and helplessness
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.280]   and despair, we are ready to listen to the message of this gospel. What is it? Well, here it is,
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.080]   the very thing that Paul is reminding Timothy about. And you see, the thing that we want to
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:15.280]   look at tonight is this, that it all starts and centers in one person. I am not ashamed. Why?
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:24.680]   Well, the answer is, I know him whom I have believed. You see, he can't leave him alone. He
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.800]   keeps on talking about him. In verse 9 he says, "Who has saved us and called us with an holy
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.680]   calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.760]   in Christ Jesus before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior,
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:45.880]   Jesus Christ." Christ Jesus, Jesus Christ, him whom I have believed, always the same person.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:55.040]   Now, let me put it to you like this quite simply. What was it that made this man the apostle Paul,
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:02.760]   the man he was? How can he be so happy there in that prison? How can he smile in the face of death?
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:09.120]   How can he rejoice in tribulations as he's doing? You know, there's only one answer. He'd met a
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:18.720]   person. He'd met a person. He'd met this blessed him. Before he met him, this man was sold of
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:26.160]   Tarsus, self-satisfied, complacent Jew, and yet miserable, unhappy. A self-righteous man is never
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.960]   really happy, because he's always watching, he always has to be careful. If you are trying to
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.320]   save yourself and living a life of morality and of religion, you never know happiness. Religion
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.760]   has never made anybody happy, neither has morality. It makes you decent, self-contained, but never
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:49.560]   happy. Morality has never made a man sing. Religion never makes a man sing. They're all gloom. And
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:56.240]   that's why we must never lose the differentiation between religion and Christianity. It is
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.000]   Christianity alone that makes a man sing. And what is it that made this man sing? Well, you see,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.520]   he tells us in many places, and we know his story. It was what happened to him on the road to
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:18.040]   Damascus. He went out breathing threatenings and slaughter, and then he saw that blessed face and
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:28.520]   heard that voice, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And he realized that this was the Lord of
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:36.240]   glory. He met Jesus Christ. He got to know him, and his whole life was changed. He became a new
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   man. He lived a new life, and here he is now, facing the end of it, but triumphing. Why,
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:51.960]   oh, I know him! I know the one I met on the road to Damascus, and all is well with me because I
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:23:02.920]   know him. Now then, the whole of Christianity depends upon this blessed person. Oh, that I
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:09.480]   hadn't to keep on bringing in these negatives, but I must. My dear friends, I'll have to give
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.600]   an account of God for my stewardship. We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ as this
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.400]   greatest of all preachers, and give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:29.800]   Therefore, knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. And in my feeble, unworthy little
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:39.080]   way, I've got to do the same thing. And I know that we are living in a world which is telling
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.000]   men and women, as fast as it can, and as frequently as it can, in books and articles,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.760]   and on the television, and on the wireless, that what matters is the teaching of Jesus.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.200]   And that Christianity means taking the teaching of Jesus, and doing your best to put it into
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   practice, and to imitate him. And the apostle here tells us that that's a lie, who hath saved us,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:12.000]   and called us with an early calling, not according to our works. And therefore, I have to say once
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.200]   more, that it is not the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ that matters to us primarily. What
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:26.800]   then? Well, the person himself, him whom I have believed. The apostle isn't saying I'm happy in
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.640]   prison, because ever since I heard his teaching, I've been doing my best to put it into practice,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.760]   and I can look back across my record. That isn't what he's saying. I know him whom I have believed,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.400]   and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed. It's he. It's all he.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:53.560]   And my dear friends, it is still the same tonight. I'm not here to exhort you to practice the Sermon
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.160]   on the Mount. I'm not here to tell you to follow Christ. That follows, that comes,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:09.680]   but I'm here primarily to ask you a question. Do you know him? Have you met this Lord Jesus
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   Christ? Is your confidence tonight in him? I know him whom I have believed, and I'm absolutely
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:28.480]   certain that he, I know, can keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. My dear
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:35.080]   friends, what I want to do therefore tonight is to again hold him before you. And what am I to
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   hold before you? What the apostle reminds Timothy of. Now, I don't know whether I said last Sunday
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.080]   night or not, whether I did or not, I'm going to say it again, because it's so vital. Here is a
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:54.840]   man, Timothy, who is a preacher and an evangelist, and yet you notice that the great apostle has to
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.480]   tell him the elements of the Christian faith. He has to take him back to the very foundation
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   principles. I'm going to do the same. I'm not apologizing. I am more and more convinced that
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.440]   all our troubles in church and state today are due to the fact that we have forgotten first
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:16.400]   principles. People are assuming they know what Christianity is, and they don't. They wouldn't
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:23.880]   be what they are if they knew. This is Christianity, and it is this person, and it is the facts about
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.480]   the person. Now, then what are they? Well, we listen to the apostle putting them before us.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:39.920]   Jesus. Christ Jesus, or Jesus Christ. The apostle is as he is because he's met a person, and this
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:47.880]   person's name is Jesus. Jesus of Nazareth. That's a man. That's the one who was born as a little
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:54.200]   babe in Bethlehem, and whose little body was put in the manger. They called his name Jesus. Very
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:02.240]   well. We are looking at a man. All right, we must be clear about this. Our whole position is based
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:11.760]   upon this person who is a man called Jesus. But now here's the vital question. Is he only a man?
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:19.440]   Is he only the greatest religious teacher that the world has ever known, and the greatest moral
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:26.160]   exemplar? Is that all? Well, listen to what the apostle tells us about him. But he's now made
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:36.880]   manifest, he says, by the appearing, appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ. Whoever this is,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   he is one of whom we can say that he has appeared. Do you say that about ordinary human beings,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.920]   that they have made an appearance in this world? When a baby is born in your family,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.320]   do you say this child has made his appearance? Of course you don't. You say he's been born,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:03.640]   and you're right. But here is one who has appeared. Epiphany. And you see what that means is this,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.200]   that he existed before he appeared. He was there behind the veil, as it were,
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:16.000]   but suddenly the curtain is drawn back, and he appears. Now then, do you see, this is a part of
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.400]   the essential teaching. And then we must link that up with this other phrase. "Who hath saved us,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:29.120]   and called us with an early calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:36.240]   and grace." That's referring to God the Father, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing. Now this is essential Christianity.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:55.160]   And it is again to tell us, not only that this is God's world, but that he's still concerned about
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:01.560]   it, and still interested in it. But still more important, that even before the very foundation
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:09.960]   of the world, God had conceived a great purpose and plan of saving this world. You see, this is
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.520]   the thing the world doesn't know about. We're hanging on the lips of statesmen and politicians,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.160]   wondering what great philosophers are going to say, trying, as civilization has always done,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.440]   as I've reminded you, to get things a little bit better. But my dear friend, what you need to know
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.000]   is this, that God has a plan and a purpose for this world. He'd planned it before the very
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.400]   foundation of the world, and it was there in the mind of God. It's now been made manifest by the
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:41.440]   appearing of this person. Now this is the message of the whole of the New Testament. Indeed, it's
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:48.680]   the message of the Old Testament as well. What is the message of the Old Testament? Isn't it this?
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:55.960]   Isn't the whole of that Old Testament looking forward to something? What's it looking forward
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.280]   to? It is looking forward to the fulfillment of the promise that God made to fallen men in the
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:09.000]   Garden of Eden. When men fell, God said to him, "Well, as the result of this, this is to be your
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   punishment, that there shall be perpetual enmity and warfare between the seed of that serpent and
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:25.160]   your seed. But the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. There is to be a conquest over
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:32.120]   evil and sin and the devil and hell, and God is going to do it." So you see, the whole of the Old
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.440]   Testament is looking forward to the fulfillment of this promise. That's the marvelous thing about
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.520]   the Old Testament. Once you begin to look at it with a New Testament eye, you'll see this unfolding
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   purpose going on and on and on. God repeats the promise. God then takes a man of the name of
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.480]   Abram out of paganism and turns him into one of his own men and says, "I'm going to make a nation
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.800]   out of you," and he proceeded to do so. Why does he do this? Well, because out of this man is going
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.160]   to come this seed of the woman that's going to bruise the serpent's head. There's the same promise.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.240]   God said to Abram, "Look here, come out, count the stars if you can, count the sand on the seashore.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:14.640]   Such shall be thy progeny. In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the world be blessed."
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:23.320]   And they were waiting for this. And on and on the promise goes. You get it repeated almost
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:29.880]   endlessly in that Old Testament. You come to Moses, the great lawgiver, the man who delivered
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.960]   the people out of the bondage and the captivity of Egypt and took them into the land of Canaan,
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.200]   and you get God instructing him about the furnishing of the tabernacle and telling him
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.760]   what sacrifices to offer. Blood has got to be offered, sacrifices have to be presented to God.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:52.000]   Why? Well, this is foreshadowing what God is going to do. The lamb must be killed morning and evening,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.320]   and so the ritual and the ceremony go on, repeated and elaborated in the temple.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:05.480]   And as you read the book of Psalms and as you read the messages of the prophets,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.960]   you find the same thing. One of the greatest of all those prophets, the evangelical prophet,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.360]   as he is sometimes called, Isaiah, he comes to the people and he says, "Comfort ye my people,
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:23.520]   comfort ye my people, saith your God." Why? Well, this great one is coming. "Every valley
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.360]   shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, the rough way shall be made smooth,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:35.800]   prepare the highway for our God. Every eye shall see him, all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:44.880]   Comfort ye, he's coming." And that was the message of all the prophets. They were all looking forward
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:51.440]   to the coming of this mighty deliverer. Man is in the slavery of sin and Satan. He's helpless,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.200]   he can't do anything, he can't keep the law, he's a failure. But the deliverer is coming,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:02.960]   and they're looking forward. And then we come to this great and tremendous statement.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:12.680]   "When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman,
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:20.560]   made under the law to redeem them that were under the law." Notice the terms. "When the
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.440]   fullness of the times was come." God's purpose before the foundation of the world,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:34.000]   before the world began. His purpose, his plan. And he's preparing and preparing. Now the time
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:42.920]   has come, the fullness of the times. The time is complete, and he comes. "God sent forth his Son
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.520]   made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that are under the law." Now this is it,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:59.960]   you see, the appearing, the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ. That babe in the manger
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   there in Bethlehem is none other than the Son of God, the eternal Son of God. "In the beginning
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:16.320]   was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by him,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.880]   and without him was nothing made that is made. The eternal Word of God." Yes, but this is the
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:30.920]   message. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The babe in Bethlehem is the Word made flesh.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:36.960]   He is the eternal Son of God appearing. He's entered into time, he's come into the world,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:43.920]   he's taken on human nature, he's become incarnate, he's added manhood to the Godhead. Here is the
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:55.680]   whole mystery, the appearing. So you see, you know nothing about the Christian comfort and
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:03.520]   consolation until you believe in the virgin birth. Jesus of Nazareth is not just a man,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   he's not even perfect man, he's God man. Born of a virgin, conceived of the Holy Ghost,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.240]   he has the faith of Paul, he has the faith of the early church, he has the faith of the church
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.120]   throughout the running centuries. Modern men can't believe that. Well, let modern men go to
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:33.200]   hell then. That's all I've got to say to him. It takes God as well as men to save men. And when
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.400]   you and I know the plague of our own souls, and when we realize the spiritual character of the
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.680]   law of God, and our own moral and spiritual impotence, we'll have no trouble about believing
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:51.720]   in the virgin birth. Even that first man, Adam, that was made perfect in the image and likeness
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:59.080]   of God, he sinned and he fell. And you see, God couldn't even save the world by making another
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:06.600]   perfect man. The perfect man had failed. Not only can fallen men not save himself, perfect men can't
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:14.280]   stand against the devil. It needs more, and more has come, appearing. God the Son has come out of
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:25.720]   heaven into earth. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. It is the seed of the
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:34.280]   woman, he had no earthly human father. He is conceived of the Holy Ghost. Here's the one who
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:41.600]   had been prophesied. Here's the long-expected Jesus. Here's the one of whom a message was given
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:51.160]   to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist. Here is the one of whom the archangel came to his
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:37:02.360]   mother Mary and said this, "Hail thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:09.480]   art thou among women." Mary was fearful. The angel says, "Fear not Mary, for thou hast found favor
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.600]   with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:21.920]   name Jesus. He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God shall
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:27.240]   give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Mary says, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.160]   The angel answered and said, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:46.240]   Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore that holy thing that shall be born of thee, this is not a
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:53.840]   mere man, this is God in the flesh. Here's a person with two natures in the one person. He's
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   perfect God, he's perfect man. He has appeared. This is the central message of Christianity. What
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.280]   you and I need is not a greater message, a greater teaching. We need someone who's strong enough to
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:17.560]   deliver us, who can redeem us and save us. And here he is, he's appeared. God from the heavens,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:27.520]   very God of very God, Son of God in glory, he's come. The appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:35.400]   And then keep on looking at him. The apostle here, you see, is really giving a summary of it all.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.280]   Look at this person. "You see, I am what I am," says Paul, "because I met him, because I know him,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.760]   because I know that he's going to keep that which I have committed unto him." Well, very well,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.040]   let us look at him. Here's the one on whom everything depends. He's been born as a babe.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:57.800]   There he is in the manger, but follow his story, listen to his teaching. He never went to the
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:05.200]   school of the Pharisees. He was brought up as a carpenter. And yet when he begins to teach,
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.920]   what people say about him is this, "This man speaketh with authority and not as the Pharisees
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:17.680]   and scribes." The soldier sent to arrest him came back and said, "Never men speak like this man."
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.120]   They said, "We couldn't touch him. There was something about him. There was an authority.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:29.560]   We've never heard anything like... Never men speak like this man." Listen to what he's got to say.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:40.920]   "Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, but I say unto you, I am the way, the truth,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:51.760]   and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. Before Abraham was, I am. I am come."
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:58.880]   Always the same, you see, that I was born. I am come. He's one who's come into the world. He's
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   the fulfillment of the prophecy. The son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:11.960]   wings. I am come. Notice his claims. He turns to men following their ordinary occupation,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:18.440]   and he doesn't hesitate to say to them, "Follow me." And they did. Who is this that amends this
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:24.040]   kind of allegiance, this totalitarian allegiance, this surrender, this man who puts himself apart
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:33.400]   and says, "You have, I am." Who is this? Here's the vital question. But look at the evidence again.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:43.280]   Look at his miracles. Oh, they're an essential part of the message concerning him. John in his
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.520]   gospel tells us that the miracles were signs, that he worked his miracles in order to give
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.640]   people knowledge and information as to who he was. And he used it as an argument when they
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.880]   didn't believe him. He said, "Though you don't believe my words, believe the works. Believe me
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:06.200]   for the very work's sake." When poor John the Baptist, as the result of his imprisonment and
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.600]   his ill health, had got into a bit of trouble about him and sends his two messengers, he says,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:17.560]   "Go back and tell John again the things that you have seen and have heard. The blind receive their
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:23.880]   sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are made to hear. Here it is." And unto
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:30.000]   the poor is the gospel preach. He worked miracles and people were astonished. They said, "We have
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.560]   seen strange things today. What is this?" They were filled with fear. Even his own disciples
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:48.000]   were alarmed. "Miracles! Who is this?" And then observe his perfect sinless life. There he is in
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.280]   the wilderness, tempted of the devil for forty days, but he doesn't sin. And he is able to say
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:01.920]   at the end of his life, "Who can bring a charge against me?" And they couldn't. They failed. They
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.760]   tried to, but they completely failed. Here is one who conquers the devil, conquers evil, conquers
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:16.240]   all temptations. But then you look at something that seems to be a contradiction of everything
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.800]   that has gone before. You see this person that can commend the waves and cause them to be still
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.360]   and silence the howling gale, that can make the lame man leap as a heart and give life even to
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:39.560]   the dead, arrested in apparent weakness, condemned, and nailed to a tree. And you see him dying the
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.120]   most shameful, ignominious death that it was possible for a man ever to die. There he is,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.720]   dying in weakness. And you hear the shouting and the laughter, the raucous laughter and the
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.480]   jubilation of all his enemies. They've killed him. They've got rid of him. It's the end of him. He's
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.000]   finished. They take down his body and they bury it in a grave. They roll a stone of it and put a
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.920]   seal over it and put soldiers to guard the lot. And there's the end of Jesus of Nazareth. But it
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:14.640]   doesn't. And you notice that this is the thing that the apostle reminds Timothy of here most
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:21.080]   particularly. He is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:30.440]   abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, this
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:37.960]   message concerning him and what he has done. He rises triumphant o'er the grave. Now my friends,
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:45.240]   the whole of Paul's case depends upon this. You read the early chapters of the book of the Acts
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.840]   of the Apostles and you'll find that what they preached was Jesus and the resurrection. Why the
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:56.960]   resurrection? Well, you see, it is the resurrection that finally proves who he was. Even the disciples
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.320]   were shaky until the resurrection. It was the resurrection that finally convinced them. And
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.000]   Paul says that he was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.040]   holiness, by the resurrection from among the dead. If he hasn't done this, he's not the Savior. He
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:20.160]   has abolished death. He's disannulled it. He's put it out of court. He's disintegrated it. And
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.920]   at the same time he has brought life and immortality to light, life and incorruption,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:32.840]   through his gospel. Now then, here you see is the Christian message. Did you notice it in that
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.400]   sermon that Paul preached in Antioch of Pisidia that I read to you at the beginning, out of the
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.160]   thirteenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles? It's a perfect exposition of my text
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   tonight. This is what Paul preached. This Jesus whom they took and put him in a grave, but God
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:57.520]   raised him. And what does all this mean? Well, let me just give you a summary of what it means as I
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.920]   close this evening. God knows, and God willing, we shall go on to elaborate this more and more in
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.200]   detail. But it's all here. Here's a perfect summary for you of Christian doctrine. It's the man who
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.920]   believes this and who's sure of it, who's going to live and die like Paul did. Here's the meaning
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:21.240]   of it all. What's it tell us? Well, it tells us who he is. It tells us that he is the Son of God.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:29.840]   David, as Paul argues in that sermon in Antioch of Pisidia, was a very great and a very wonderful
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:38.640]   man. Yes, but when he died, his body saw corruption. Here is the only one who died and whose body did
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:45.880]   not see corruption. Here is one who's come out from among the dead, the firstborn from among the
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:53.520]   dead, the first to rise. Who is he? He's God the Son. That's what it proves. Everything about him
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   proves it. His coming, his virgin birth, his appearing, his whole character, his life, his
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:06.240]   teaching, his miracles, his resurrection, they all prove the same thing, that this is none other than
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:14.760]   the Son of God. And what was he doing in this world? Well, we are told, "who hath saved us."
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:22.440]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:28.320]   should not perish, but have everlasting life. He said it himself. He said the Son of Man has
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:35.600]   come to seek and to save that which is lost. He hasn't come to tell us how to save ourselves.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.960]   He's come to save us. And he had to come all the way from the glory to earth and to go to the cross
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.840]   and to be buried and to rise. He had to do all this in order to save us. He's come to do it,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   to seek and to save that which is lost. And what has he done? Well, you see, these are the things
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:01.960]   that he's done. He has shown us to start with what man is meant to be. He came into this world that
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:09.800]   you and I are in. He came into his own. He lived in this very world that we're living in. And he
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.560]   had the same problems and same trials. He was tempted in all points like us. We are yet without
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   sin. He didn't live in a glass house. He didn't live in some great pump, in a great palace,
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:26.400]   or in a castle. No, no. He lived a life of poverty, the ordinary life of men and women,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:31.920]   and was buffeted and battered. He saw the vileness and the evil and the sin of the world with his
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:39.600]   own eyes, close quarters. He's gone through it all. But he's shown us how man is meant to live.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:48.520]   He's shown us how a man can walk through it all and not be tarnished by it, not be touched by it,
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:55.880]   not be polluted by it in any sense at all. You look at him, you see a perfect man,
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:02.480]   perfect manhood, man walking in communion with God through this world as man was meant to be
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.400]   at the beginning. There you see it all in him. But thank God he doesn't stop at that. If that
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.360]   were all, he'd be our greatest condemnation tonight. If there is one thing that is more
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.200]   fatuous than anything else, it is this notion that we are meant to imitate Jesus Christ.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.920]   My dear friend, if you can't satisfy yourself, how can you imitate him? The thing is monstrous,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:36.680]   it's impossible. He's God as well as man. Sinless, pure, perfect, oh, it isn't all. He came,
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:43.080]   why did he come? Well, not merely to let us know again what man was meant to be, but he came in
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:49.560]   order to conquer our enemies. Why do we fail in life? Well, because of our weakness, because of
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.840]   the power of the devil. Why does a man sin? Because of the power of temptation and evil.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   Why is man afraid of death? We're all afraid of death by nature. We may pretend we're not. We
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.320]   sometimes like a child whistle to keep up our courage in the dark, but the whole of mankind
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:16.020]   is subject to bondage, the fear of death. Why is that? Well, the apostle this same man tells the
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:20.640]   Corinthians, "The trouble is this, the sting of death is sin." That's the trouble about death,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.440]   is sin. If there wasn't such a thing as sin, we wouldn't be afraid of death. But you see,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.720]   there is sin, and a man has a feeling within him that death isn't the end, and that he goes on and
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.040]   meets God in judgment, and he knows he's guilty. So he's afraid, even though he hasn't much
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.740]   knowledge of theology. Instinctively, he's afraid. The sting of death is sin, and the strength of
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:42.480]   sin is the law of God. We are conscious of unworthiness and condemnation. Those are our
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:53.560]   enemies. He's come to conquer every one of our enemies. And thank God he has done so. As I've
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:00.160]   told you, he lived a sinless life. Evil and sin couldn't touch him. What about the devil? Well,
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.960]   as I told you, the devil had him for 40 days in the wilderness, and there he tried him, he plied
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:10.200]   him with his questions. He tried to catch him and to trip him. "If thou be the Son of God,
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:15.360]   give him any festation." "No, no, get thee behind me, Satan." "Tempt not the Lord thy God," he says,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.960]   and quotes Scripture to him. He's conquered sin and evil. He's conquered temptation. He's
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:34.120]   conquered the devil. But the last enemy is death. And there he is, and he is an enemy,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:43.640]   with his terrible side. And every hour you live, you come that hour nearer to him. The last enemy
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.920]   is death. And there he is, and he gets all men down. The stoutest has to go, the greatest has
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:55.480]   to go. Can't you see them decaying? Great men entering into a kind of nunnage again,
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:00.940]   entering into a second childhood. And they're going to die, and all men are going to die. The
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:13.120]   last enemy, he gets everybody down. And before a man can live happily in this world, before a man
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.680]   can live a triumphant life and be more than conqueror, he must not only be able to conquer
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   the devil and sin and temptation, he's got to be able to conquer death. He's got to be able to look
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.880]   through death. He's got to be able to smile at the face of death. He's got to see beyond it and
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:35.280]   through it. And there's only one way he can do it, this person. What's he done? Well, you know,
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.400]   our translation isn't as good as it ought to be here. Really, it should be translated like this,
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:46.120]   this tenth verse. "But now he is made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:53.000]   who on the one hand has disannulled death, disintegrated death, taken death apart,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:01.880]   taken it to pieces, and on the other hand has brought life and incorruption to light." That
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:11.320]   is what he's done. He has conquered the last enemy. He's gone through death. He's taken the
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:18.280]   sting out of it. He has established that death is not the end. He can turn to death and say,
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:26.080]   "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" He's disannulled death. Even the
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:34.240]   last enemy has been parted. "And on the other hand," I say, "he has brought life and immortality to
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:41.520]   light." The resurrection of Jesus Christ is an absolute proof that death is not the end. This
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:47.000]   is not the only life. This is not the only world. There is another realm. There is another life.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.160]   There is another world. It's incorruptible. There is no tarnish there. It's pure. It's immortal.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:04.360]   It's glorious. It's absolute. And he has given us a glimpse of it. He's come through death and
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:13.320]   given us a glimpse and a view of life and incorruption and immortality. So that knowing
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:18.600]   him and knowing the truth about him, I know that this isn't the only life and the only world. I
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:25.520]   know that should men put me to death, it isn't the end. Indeed, I know in Christ Jesus what this
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:33.240]   apostle Paul knew, that to me to live is Christ and that to die is gain. It means being with Christ,
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.680]   which is far better. He's gone through. He's the other side. He's gone beyond the veil. He's in
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:45.880]   the glory and I shall be with him. That's the faith of the apostle. I'm not ashamed, he says,
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:52.320]   because I know him whom I have believed and I know that he's conquered man, he's conquered sin,
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.120]   he's conquered the devil, he's conquered hell, he's conquered the grave, he's conquered everything.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:07.640]   And my soul is in his safekeeping and he who has conquered all my enemies will bring me to himself
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:13.880]   in the glory everlasting. And at the same time, he knew that this Christ in his perfect life of
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:20.680]   obedience to God had dealt with the other enemy and that is the law of God, the law. The sting of
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:26.560]   death is sin and the strength of sin is the law. God's holy nature, God's abhorrence of sin. How
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:33.120]   can I be just with God? The law of God condemns me. How can I keep the law? I can't. Here is one
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:40.520]   who has. He's kept the law perfectly for me, made of a woman, made under the law that he might
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:49.400]   redeem them that are under the law. And he's done it by his active, perfect life of obedience. And
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:57.720]   on the cross on Calvary's hill, he bore the punishment that that selfsame holy law of God
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:08.360]   meets upon my sin and transgression, my evil and my guilt. He's done everything. Everything that I
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:14.280]   need he's done. Everything that gets me down and defeats me, he's conquered and he alone has and
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:26.400]   it took God as well as men to do it. The appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, my dear friend, the
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:38.760]   only way to live life, the only way to die, is to know Jesus Christ, to believe in him. I know him
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:47.520]   in whom I have believed. I believe that he's very God and very man. I believe that he came from the
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:56.240]   glory of eternity and was born of the Virgin Mary. I believe he demonstrated and manifested his
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:05.200]   deity in his miracles of power. I believe that when he died on the cross, he was dying in order
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:11.600]   that I might be forgiven. I believe that he was smitten with the stripes that were meant for me
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:24.400]   and that I so richly deserve. I believe he made his soul an offering for my sin. I believe that
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:31.360]   he did so in a perfect manner and has rendered a complete satisfaction to every demand of a holy
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:39.800]   God and of a holy law. I believe that he arose literally from the grave in the body, the same
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:45.960]   body but it was changed and glorified. I believe in the literal physical resurrection. I have no
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   gospel apart from it, for I wouldn't know that he'd conquered death apart from this. I wouldn't
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:54.880]   know that he's son of God apart from this. I believe in the literal physical resurrection,
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   whatever modern science so-called may say. I believe that he ascended into heaven in the
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:10.040]   sight of his assembled disciples ten days before the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem on Mount Olivet.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:19.080]   I believe they saw him passing through the heavens. I believe that he sent the Holy Ghost
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:26.160]   on the day of Pentecost. I believe that he will come again to receive us unto himself who believe
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:32.480]   in him, to judge the whole world in righteousness and to set up his eternal kingdom. That's what I
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:45.840]   believe. I know him in whom I have believed. I rest my faith on him alone who died for my
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:57.720]   transgressions to atone. I've handed my soul and its eternal welfare to him and I am persuaded
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:07.240]   that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him until that day.
