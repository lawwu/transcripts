[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.240]   Today, my guest is Dr. Maya Shankar.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.360]   Dr. Maya Shankar is a cognitive scientist
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.040]   who did her undergraduate training at Yale University,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.440]   her PhD thesis at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar,
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.160]   and a postdoctoral fellowship also in cognitive science
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.780]   at Stanford University.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.000]   Dr. Shankar also served as a senior advisor
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.980]   to the White House,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.480]   and she founded and served as the chair
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.700]   of the White House Behavioral Science Team.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.460]   Dr. Shankar is also the host of her own podcast entitled
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.080]   "A Slight Change of Plans."
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.800]   And indeed, Dr. Shankar herself is no stranger
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.160]   to having to make major changes to one's life plans.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.560]   As you'll learn today,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.840]   prior to all of those incredible accomplishments
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   that Dr. Shankar has achieved,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.520]   she was a student at the Juilliard Conservatory of Music,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   preparing her life to become
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.720]   a professional concert violinist.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.400]   But as you'll also soon learn,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.500]   she then experienced a career devastating injury,
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.840]   forcing herself to have to reframe everything
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.960]   about her life plans and her own identity.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.440]   And that's really what we talk about today.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.480]   We talk about identity,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.440]   not just Dr. Shankar's prior and current identities,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.240]   but of course, your identity.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.880]   We pose a number of questions geared toward getting you
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060]   to ask, who am I really?
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.520]   Do my goals align with who I am and what I want?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.800]   Dr. Shankar shares with us the research on identity,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.980]   goals, motivation, and plans,
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.760]   as well as many practical tools
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.920]   to answer those key questions that guide us down
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520]   either the correct or incorrect trajectories in life.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.240]   She shares with us, for instance,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.440]   how to assess on-paper goals
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.760]   of the sort that you would see on a CV.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.240]   So which school, which job, which salary,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.520]   which spouse, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.260]   and how to relate those to the deeper feelings
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.980]   that relate to one's ability
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.120]   to continually pursue a given goal,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.240]   knowing that it's the right goal for us.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   We also talk about the science of feelings,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.420]   what they can and cannot tell us,
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.940]   and when they should or should not serve as a compass
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.480]   for guiding our everyday and longer-term decisions.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.740]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740]   you will realize that Dr. Shankar
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.700]   is essentially handing you a science-supported roadmap
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.140]   for how to determine and assess your identity and goals
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.480]   and how one influences the other,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.860]   that is, how your identity influences your goals
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400]   and how your goals influences your identity
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.080]   in becoming the person that you want to be.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.780]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.360]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.500]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.420]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.380]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.800]   to the general public.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.940]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.860]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.560]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.900]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.080]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.820]   I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.320]   and with guests about the need to get
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.220]   approximately one gram of high-quality protein
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.160]   per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.400]   There are many different ways that one can do that,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.060]   but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.340]   by ingesting excessive calories.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.580]   Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.700]   of quality protein per calorie,
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.140]   and it achieves that in delicious things
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.560]   like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.420]   I particularly like the ground venison.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.740]   I make those into venison burgers
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.900]   probably five times a week or more.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.260]   I also like the jerky for its convenience,
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.380]   especially when I'm traveling
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.180]   or I'm especially busy with work,
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.740]   and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient-dense
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.340]   high-quality source of protein.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.860]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.660]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress coverage
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.780]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.020]   Sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.340]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.180]   When we're sleeping well and enough,
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180]   everything in life goes much better.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.060]   And when we aren't sleeping well or long enough,
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.300]   things in life get worse.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.520]   We know that from data.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.080]   We all know that from our own experience.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.480]   One of the essential things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.340]   is that the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.020]   needs to be such that your core body temperature drops
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.420]   by about one to three degrees
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.660]   in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.660]   and then increase by one to three degrees
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.300]   in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.900]   With Eight Sleep smart mattress covers,
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.500]   you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.140]   so that it's ideally matched to your temperature needs.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.060]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.640]   a few years ago, and it has completely transformed
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.260]   the quality of the sleep that I get.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.900]   So much so that I actually loathe traveling
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.820]   because I don't have my Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.640]   when I travel.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.900]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.540]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.100]   and you'll save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.560]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.900]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.060]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.100]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Maya Shankar.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.740]   Welcome, I'm so happy you're here.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.580]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.020]   It's great to be here.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.820]   - I have a lot of questions about identity,
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.500]   about goals and motivation, and about change in general.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.420]   But I'd like to start off with identity.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.100]   And I'd like to divide it into two segments.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.780]   The first is how we form an identity.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.020]   And, you know, we'll get into your story
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   in, I hope, a bit or more detail.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.760]   But when we're younger, we tend to ask questions
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.860]   about ourselves, but also about the world around us.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.560]   We want to learn what our parents do for a living,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.340]   what the workers on the street are doing that for, et cetera.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.540]   How much of our early identity do you think
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.960]   is formed by observation of what we are doing
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.680]   versus observation and labels of the people
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.080]   that are around us and closest to us?
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.680]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.220]   I think a lot of it is based on what we see around us
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.220]   and what we see is deemed successful and society privileges.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.520]   And there's a concept called identity foreclosure,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   where actually when you're young, right,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.180]   it's not just that you're observing
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.280]   what your parents are doing
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.480]   or what your peer group is doing.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.920]   They impose their own structures on you.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.240]   And so what that can do is it can really limit your mindset
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.940]   in terms of what it is that you want to achieve
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.000]   and what it is that you're capable of achieving.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.700]   And so oftentimes when people experience
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.900]   identity foreclosure, they have to take a lot of active steps
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.880]   to overcome whatever biases or limitations
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.200]   they experienced as a young person,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.560]   given what they were projected to do or believe, right?
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.160]   So identity can be about what you do.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.360]   It can also be about what you believe in the world, right?
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.920]   And so a lot of those belief systems are also passed on.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.160]   You inherit belief systems from the people
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.120]   that surround you when you're young.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.280]   And if there's one thing that I've learned,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.160]   it's that we tend to put a huge premium
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.040]   on what it is that we do.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.760]   We tend to define ourselves by what we do.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.480]   And you can see this in the questions we ask young children.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.340]   What do you want to be when you grow up, right?
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.480]   We never say, who do you want to be when you grow up?
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.000]   What kind of person do you want to be when you grow up?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.900]   We say, what do you want to be?
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.960]   And the consequence of that kind of mindset
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.740]   is that we end up anchoring our identities very firmly
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.360]   to what it is that we do.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.860]   And I certainly, you were talking,
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.640]   you were alluding to my personal story, right?
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.060]   I started playing the violin when I was a little kid,
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.060]   six years old, became absolutely obsessed.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.900]   And for the large part of my childhood,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.680]   I was first and foremost a violinist.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.740]   I mean, if I had met you, I'd be like, hey, Andrew,
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.560]   I'm a violinist.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.560]   And then the second up would be, I'm Maya.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's how tethered my identity was to being a violinist.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.960]   And then fast forward to when I'm a teenager,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.240]   these huge dreams of going pro and becoming,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.140]   yeah, just like hopefully a professional violinist
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.980]   for the rest of my life.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.760]   And then I tear a tendon in my hand.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.260]   My dreams end overnight.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.040]   And suddenly, there's this profound loss of identity.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.100]   Because what I hadn't realized is that in losing the violin,
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.300]   sure, I was losing the ability to play the instrument,
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.480]   but I was actually losing a huge part of who I was.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   And that was so destabilizing and so disorienting for me.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.120]   Because when you define yourself by the what,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.800]   then as soon as the what goes away, you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.900]   who the hell am I, right?
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.480]   What do I do?
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.000]   What value do I bring to the world?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.700]   And what I experienced at the time
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.480]   is known in cognitive science as identity paralysis.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.600]   Maybe you felt this way during various transitions
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   in your life.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   But basically, who you are and what you're about
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.300]   is suddenly called into question.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.040]   And you end up feeling really stuck, right?
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   You don't have the courage to imagine
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.120]   what a future could look like.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.200]   And I certainly fell prey to identity paralysis.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.000]   And it took me a long time to figure out
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.720]   what my path would look like moving forward.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   But I learned a really valuable lesson
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.000]   from that very formative experience
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.580]   I had with change about how it is that I should define myself.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.240]   And for what it's worth, I don't think our desire as humans
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.720]   to have identities is going anywhere.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.920]   We're not going to be able to dispose of identities.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.360]   And we shouldn't, because our self identities
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   bring us so much meaning and purpose in our lives, right?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.200]   You're a podcaster.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.940]   I'm a podcaster.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.700]   You're a scientist.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.320]   I'm a scientist.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.700]   These things are actually really helpful and motivating.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.560]   So we don't want to do away with identities altogether.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.680]   But what we can be more particular about
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.840]   is what we anchor our identities to.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.160]   And I have learned in my adult life
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   to anchor my identity to why I do the things I do rather than
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.400]   what I do.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.960]   And I found this to be a much more durable, reliable
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.800]   relationship.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.960]   So to make this concrete, let's think about the violin, right?
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.240]   Sure, I loved playing.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.680]   I loved how music sounded.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.680]   I loved the way the violin felt. But when I stripped away
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.700]   all the superficial features of the violin, what I really,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.440]   really loved and was so drawn to as a young child
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.120]   was the emotional connection that I
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.800]   could form through my music.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.680]   So that might have been with my orchestra mates, my chamber
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.360]   musician friends, playing solo and performing
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   in front of an audience.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.040]   And ideally, we all feel something new
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.400]   that we haven't felt before.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.080]   I mean, it's kind of an intoxicating feeling
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.960]   when you're little to have the ability to inspire
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.840]   new feelings in people, right?
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.000]   And I was so drawn to human connection.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And when I realized that human connection was
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.040]   at the heart of what it is that drives me as a person,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.720]   like what lights me up every single day
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.440]   is a desire to connect with others,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.800]   to understand other people, to understand their psychology,
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.960]   to understand how their minds work.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.920]   Then when the violin was taken away from me,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   even in terms of the narrative I tell myself about my life,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.960]   I could still find that same core underlying future
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.840]   elsewhere.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.120]   And I have been able to, right?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.380]   I found it as an academic, as a cognitive scientist who
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.640]   studies the science of connection and emotion.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.020]   I've seen that connection play out in the work
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.560]   that I did in public policy when I was at the White House.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.160]   Obviously, with my podcast, "A Slight Change of Plans,"
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.440]   you're forming these intimate connections of people every day.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.640]   And so even though it feels in my life
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   like I've done such disparate things,
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.680]   there actually is a powerful through line
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.360]   that connects all of them.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.640]   And that is my desire to connect emotionally.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.040]   And so what I would recommend to people who are listening,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.080]   especially if they're in the throes of change
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   and they're feeling destabilized by that threat to identity,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.240]   that loss of identity, is to try to figure out
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.760]   what their through line is.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   What are the underlying features of the things
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.280]   that you used to do that you absolutely loved?
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.240]   And can you find the expression of that elsewhere?
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.880]   I love that.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   And I have so many questions.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.880]   The first one relates back to childhood identities
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.680]   and how we often can project onto children
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.040]   what they are likely to become.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.460]   I see that as mostly benevolent.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.360]   You observe a child playing with trucks in the sandbox,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.600]   and we say, oh, they're going to become a contractor.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.520]   We tend to project roles that are fairly high up
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.800]   within occupation hierarchy.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.920]   Like any parents, you wish for the best possible life
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.000]   for your kids.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.920]   But I can see the perils of doing that
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.760]   if then the kid starts to think, well,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.640]   that's what I'm bound to become because it is restrictive.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.480]   I also am fascinated by the fact that when
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.320]   we are adolescents and teens, there's
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.280]   a tendency to ask questions about identity, like who am I?
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   I don't know many 40-year-olds that
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.080]   say who am I at one's core, one's essence.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.420]   And we might change careers, change relationships,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.280]   change geographies, all sorts of things.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.520]   But there must be something going on
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.600]   in the brain in those adolescent and teen years that
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.280]   forces this question of self, of who am I?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.240]   And teenagers and notorious are trying on different uniforms,
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.720]   different friend groups, different behaviors as a way
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   to sort that out, sometimes in ways that support them
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   and sometimes in ways that act as pitfalls.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.200]   So I'm curious about what's known
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.040]   about how we develop our own identity from the inside out
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.560]   as well as from the outside in.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.960]   Yeah, no, that's really interesting,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.880]   and it's also something I'm very curious about.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.800]   I mean, we know from neuroscience research
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   that there are significant changes that the brain
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.560]   undergoes during puberty and other periods of adolescence.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   And the primary change that we see
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.200]   is a desire for independence.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.840]   And so one reason why we see teenagers grappling
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.080]   with this question of who I am is that they're actually
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.400]   breaking from these structures that they grew up around,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.760]   the imposed structures, the identity foreclosure
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.040]   that they might have experienced and are starting
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.800]   to figure out for the first time or wanting
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.040]   to ask the question for the first time, who do I want to be?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.280]   What do I want to do outside of the systems
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.680]   that I've grown up in?
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.600]   And I think this is one of the primary reasons why
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.440]   we find that during teenage years, this sort of question
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.360]   is asked more commonly.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.160]   I think that one challenge that we can face--
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.800]   because you said this one word that really caught
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.280]   my attention, which was, what's my essence?
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.320]   And one of the things I studied as a cognitive scientist
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.720]   is the psychology of what's called essentialism,
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.080]   so our underlying belief that there
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   are essential qualities to people that are immutable.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.400]   And there's lots of studies with young children and adults
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.300]   showing that we really believe that people
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.080]   do have these essences, right?
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.360]   And unclear what that even means in a metaphysical sense.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.680]   I don't know what that would even mean.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.960]   But I think that the challenge in believing
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.720]   that we have essences is that it leads
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.760]   us to believe that there are these truly immutable states
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.360]   about ourselves that we're incapable of changing.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.280]   And I think this can give rise to feelings of shame,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.040]   for example.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.600]   So what is shame?
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.480]   Shame is not the feeling, oh, I did something bad.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.140]   Shame is the feeling, I am bad, right?
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.760]   It's not that I lost at something.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.680]   I failed at something.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.320]   It's that I'm a loser.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.640]   I'm a failure.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.280]   And so the problem when we try to figure out the essence piece
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.620]   is that it doesn't give you the kind of malleable way
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.360]   of thinking that actually there might not
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.080]   be something that's so defining about you
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.040]   that you're incapable of changing.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.480]   As humans, maybe all we are are collections
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.520]   of behaviors and thoughts, right?
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.040]   And there's nothing more to it than that.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.840]   And I find that way of thinking a bit more freeing
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.040]   when it comes to who we are.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.020]   Because I think it allows us to cultivate
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.120]   more of a growth mindset.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.120]   I think it prevents us from engaging
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.920]   in these very harmful self-narratives
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.440]   that a lot of people tend to have about themselves.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.980]   I mean, probably a lot of people listening to your podcasts
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.240]   are self-critical.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.920]   I'm a very self-critical person.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.800]   We listen to this because we want to improve.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.680]   You know, I'm a fan of your show because I want to be better
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.600]   and I want to improve.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.280]   But that also is often accompanied
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.640]   by a lot of self-borating and questioning of self, right?
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.440]   And so yeah, I think I've just tried
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.920]   to have a slightly more capacious understanding of who
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.080]   I am and also recognizing that there might not really
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.360]   be these essential features that are immutable.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.200]   I don't know if you resonate with this notion
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.040]   of like the desire to feel that we have essences.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.880]   Yeah, I used the word essence without thinking too carefully
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.040]   about exactly what I meant.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.600]   But what I'm trying to say when I said essence is, you know,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.160]   as a child, I did certain things and I enjoyed some of them.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.280]   I didn't enjoy others and I really disliked others.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.880]   A very famous neuroscientist who's
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.120]   at Caltech named Marcus Meister, people literally
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.040]   refer to him as the great Marcus Meister, once said,
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.800]   and I totally subscribe to the fact
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.020]   that neural circuits in the brain
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.160]   basically divide our sensory experience along
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.280]   with dimensions of yum, yuck, and meh.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.800]   There's not a lot of in-between, right?
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.240]   Because the circuits ultimately have
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   to drive either forward movement toward more, right?
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.360]   Appetitive behaviors in nerd speak or aversive, leaning out,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   I don't want that, or just kind of a neutral response.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.320]   A yum, yuck, and meh seems to be the trinary response.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.720]   And there is this component of childhood,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.840]   I think, where we are foraging naturally using our senses,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.320]   experiencing yum, yucks, and mehs,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.920]   and hearing yum, yucks, and mehs from our parents,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.960]   that's good, that's bad, that's whatever, it's neutral.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.880]   But at some point, I certainly have had the experience,
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.840]   and I've observed others, I think,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.480]   having the experience of feeling something that's
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.320]   on a different dimension entirely, which
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.960]   is this notion of delight, which is that it sort of fills
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.100]   your body with a sense of so much yum
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.040]   that it gives you energy to do so much more of it in a way
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.840]   that is almost on a different plane.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.400]   And I'm not trying to be spiritual or metaphysical
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.320]   about it, but it feels distinctly different.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.280]   And I don't know what it represents,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.560]   but I think that's that piece that perhaps even
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.320]   as a scientist, I don't really need
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.640]   to assign a neural circuit to.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.480]   Do you think what you're describing in part is
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.760]   the feeling of awe, like when you talk about delight,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.640]   do you think part of it is a feeling of awe?
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.400]   Yeah, the first time I went to New York City
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.720]   as a six-year-old kid, I remember thinking,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.320]   and I still feel every time I'm there,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.880]   I can't believe this place exists.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.320]   It's like a human tropical reef, like everywhere
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   you look, there's life.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.640]   So that was awe and delight, although I saw some things,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.880]   this was New York in the '70s, and there were some things
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.480]   like Times Square in the '70s, right?
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.040]   If anyone's seen that show, "The Deuces,"
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.880]   I mean, it's like, it looked like that.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.280]   Especially as a young kid, it was kind of aversive.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.560]   So it wasn't always awe, but the delight for me
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.280]   was in learning and certain animals and certain things
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.360]   for you as the violin, and I want to make sure that I--
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.440]   And awe, by the way, I mean, it can be aversive, right?
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.100]   So awe isn't necessarily, I think in the Western world,
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.940]   we think of awe-inspiring experiences
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.920]   as having a positive emotional valence,
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.080]   but they can also have a negative emotional valence.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.280]   So the two criteria for a satisfying and awe-inspiring
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.960]   experience, and a lot of this work
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.420]   comes from Dacher Keltner, a professor at UC Berkeley,
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.660]   yeah, is one, there should be some element
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.580]   of perceived vastness.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.960]   This is all reference-dependent, so it's all based
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.320]   on your own frame of mind, right?
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.040]   But there's this sense of mystery and wonder
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.800]   at just how vast either the physical apparatus is,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.840]   like Times Square, it's this massive set of buildings,
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.260]   and it kind of overwhelms your senses because
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.920]   of all the lights and sounds that are hitting your visual
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.380]   system and your auditory system.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.440]   There's also conceptual vastness,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.880]   so we can feel awe when we feel the delight
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.180]   of a new scientific discovery, right?
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.400]   Or in my case, like for the first time,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.680]   reading a book about how the mind works.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.860]   I just remember marveling at this organ
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.720]   and just being completely in awe of how it works.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.400]   And then the second criteria for an awe-inspiring experience,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.240]   which I think might have been met as well when you were
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.900]   in New York, is what's called a need for accommodation.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.460]   So it's just a fancy way of saying
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.100]   that we have a certain mental model of the world,
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.220]   and typically in the presence of awe,
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.700]   we need to assimilate this new information with our existing
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.160]   model because it challenges it in some way.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.820]   And it actually leads us to have more open minds
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.740]   because we realize, wait a second,
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.040]   I have this existing vision of what the world is like,
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.780]   and now I'm experiencing this new thing,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.160]   and I need to kind of make it work.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.960]   I need to integrate it with my existing
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.080]   understanding of the world.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.740]   And that's the mind-blowing part of it, right?
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.300]   But I absolutely-- I mean, I remember my childhood
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.540]   experience kind of mirroring your experience in New York
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.200]   was I was 12 years old, maybe 11 years old.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.900]   I was at a summer music camp.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.800]   It was late at night.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.500]   I had my disc man, which is how we listened to things back
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:30.980]   in the day.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.660]   I recall.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.020]   I had a CD in there.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.620]   It was the Beethoven Violin Concerto by Anne-Sophie Mutter.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.140]   And I was like, I was so young, Andrew.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.340]   So I still don't know how to use words
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.140]   to describe how it is that I felt
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.980]   something that was so powerful and so transcendent.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.220]   But I remember listening to the first movement
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.140]   of this violin concerto, and it consumed me.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.640]   I mean, I felt chills up and down my spine.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.620]   My heart would race along with the melody.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.320]   It felt otherworldly, right?
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.820]   And I think that was kind of what you were getting at before,
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.340]   where it's like it's this altered state of mind.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.800]   And the language I've used since to code that experience
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.220]   is that it was an awe-inspiring experience because I think both
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.220]   things happened, right?
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.540]   I was impressed by the vastness of the experience.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.380]   It also sent me through time in this interesting way,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.260]   you know, back to like the time of Beethoven, right?
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.160]   So vastness can exist along a temporal horizon.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.640]   And then the need for accommodation, which was--
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.680]   I hadn't studied cognitive science at this point,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.920]   so I remember thinking, I cannot believe a collection of musical
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.900]   notes arranged just so can make me feel this way.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.860]   And then if you were to tweak it just slightly,
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.280]   just like take the E flat and move it down the stream
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   a little bit, emotional resonance completely gone
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.880]   from the passage.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   And there was just something so simple and magical
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.000]   about that realization.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.680]   So anyway, resonate with this kind of delight and awe
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.180]   experience that you described.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.980]   Yeah, I'm so glad you describe it that way.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.720]   You know, this isn't a discussion
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.340]   about my experience, but for me, I
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.840]   realize now that New York was awe-inspiring.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.760]   Prior to that, the only thing similar
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.080]   was discovering animal specialization, something
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.480]   I'm still fascinated by, the sensory systems of animals
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.540]   and how they experience the world
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.080]   and how humans experience the world.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.600]   And then ultimately, it was--
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.240]   well, then I went into skateboarding
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.080]   and that whole landscape and then eventually
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.000]   into neuroscience.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.400]   The difference between the New York experience of awe--
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.440]   and I do think that's what it was--
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.320]   and biology, animals, and eventually neuroscience
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.720]   is that, like your experience with music
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.800]   and realizing that the movement of a note
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.280]   could change something fundamentally,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.520]   when it came to learning about biology and neuroscience,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.280]   I felt not just awe, but a sense of delight in that I felt
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.040]   there was a place for me there.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.280]   And what came out of what you just described really,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.300]   really resonated in terms of this moving of a note,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.560]   because it took something from a passive experience, I believe,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.880]   of that's this incredible thing over there,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.740]   like New York City was awe.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.160]   But I didn't see myself having any kind of verb state
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.440]   within it that would change it or alter it how it is or for me.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.680]   Whereas with music, for you, or I think neuroscience,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.960]   when I realized that you could do experiments,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.600]   you could actually do some sort of manipulation.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.860]   And through that, hopefully, unveil something fundamental
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.320]   about how the brain works.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.360]   I thought, there's a place for me here.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.680]   And so I think there's something about the experience
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.480]   of something, just from a raw sensory perspective--
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.680]   music or animals or neuroscience in the examples we're
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.560]   using here--
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.160]   but then realizing that there's a verb state of self,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.920]   like that I could enact something within it that
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.320]   could give me more of that.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.640]   Whereas I think when, as a young kid in New York City,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.800]   I just didn't feel any way that I could plug into it,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.000]   except in a passive way.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Because it's the difference between a kid who--
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.560]   and this wouldn't have been me-- who sees a game of soccer,
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.760]   football, or baseball, or watches the Olympics
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.080]   and goes, that is amazing.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.240]   And the kid that says, I'm going to go do that.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.280]   In fact, I could do that.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.640]   And I could maybe do that even better, or even half as well.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.440]   And so the delight, I think, is in the possibility
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.920]   of engagement.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   And I'm fascinated-- a friend of mine
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.960]   who's a trauma therapist, he's not a neuroscientist.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   He always says, nouns are just very slow verbs.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.000]   But verbs are far more exciting because they create
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.120]   this anticipatory activity.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.280]   Anyway, I want--
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.040]   I love-- before you move on from that,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.440]   I love that you said that because you're
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.360]   helping me realize something really important about how
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   I saw my role as a violinist.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.180]   And I'm never going to modify the notes on the page
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.760]   because obviously I'm going to be faithful to what Beethoven
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   wrote.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.280]   This is what made you a great musician and me a--
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.000]   by the way, I was a failed violinist.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.160]   They pulled me out of it because the neighbor's dogs howled.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.320]   I was in Suzuki method.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.400]   I was in Suzuki too, yeah.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   I was so terrible at it that they literally
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.880]   made me stop playing music just to protect the neighborhood.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.920]   That's adorable.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.620]   And we'll talk about the science of quitting maybe later,
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.000]   but that was a great choice for you.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.080]   But what I'm realizing is that there
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.000]   was that element of defining self
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.080]   through the pursuit of the instrument.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.200]   And I saw a place for myself exactly like you did,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.520]   where I thought, I decide how this phrase unfolds.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.480]   I decide how much vibrato I use.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.320]   I decide exactly what the angling of my bow
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.440]   is and the cadence and the pacing and the emotion
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.920]   that I bring to the experience.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.620]   And when you see a place for yourself,
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.320]   that takes an awe-inspiring experience.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.380]   And actually, there's a translation process
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.220]   where you become something bigger than what
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.340]   you thought you could be.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.260]   And actually, it's so interesting
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.840]   you mentioned this, Andrew, because I've
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.220]   been chatting recently with a guy named Reginald Dwayne Betts.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.220]   And he spent nine years in prison.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.580]   And he's now a internationally renowned scholar.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.100]   So he committed a carjacking when he was 15 years old
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.540]   and then went to an adult prison for nine years.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.000]   As a 15-year-old?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.220]   He just turned 16 by the time he got his sentence.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.940]   Yeah, it was totally wild.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.940]   And he actually talks about the fact
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.020]   that there was this underground library in the prison system.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.480]   And he didn't know what he could be in the prison, what identity
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.700]   he could take on, when everyone seemed
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.620]   to be defined by what crime they had committed, right?
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.140]   It felt like his imagination was so limited to--
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.020]   and talk about identity paralysis, right?
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.460]   I mean, you're denied all your basic freedoms
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.540]   in this environment, right?
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.940]   So you really don't even have the ability
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.320]   to imagine what more you could be.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.700]   So one day, he gets a book called The Black Poets.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.800]   And in the book, he read a poem by Etheridge Knight, who
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.340]   had also spent time in prison and had
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.420]   written this incredibly stirring poem about the criminal justice
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.600]   system.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.580]   And he goes by Dwayne.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.780]   What Dwayne shared with me is he said,
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.020]   I was awe-inspired by what I was reading.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.420]   But the most important thing that
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.580]   happened in reading that book and understanding
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   the author's history is that it gave me something to be.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.980]   I saw a place for myself in this world.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.560]   And he wrote-- I mean, he was so prolific.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.220]   He wrote like 1,000 poems in the year
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.460]   after he stumbled upon this book.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.980]   And he ended up winning the MacArthur Genius Award.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.100]   He went to Yale Law School.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.340]   I mean, he's just crushed it ever since.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.840]   But I think he stumbled upon a really important point, which
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.660]   is there's a fascinating science of awe and all the benefits it
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.300]   can confer to our well-being.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.740]   But it can also serve as an entry point
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.480]   to helping to define our identities in new places.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.420]   And I just love that.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.180]   I think it's a wonderful way to think about it.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.260]   Yeah, when we see ourselves entering
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.980]   a sphere of experience that is evoking awe,
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.100]   I do think it's something about it converts to this delight.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.980]   Although, I have to acknowledge that language
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.340]   is insufficient to describe a lot of what we're referring to,
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:14.820]   right?
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.500]   That even the most reductionist language of biology
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.420]   can't grab the higher order emotions and complexity.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.340]   Not yet, anyway.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.960]   We just don't have a language for it.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.020]   I'd like to talk more about the violin,
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.600]   not just because I failed miserably at the violin.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.560]   But actually, I figured out pretty early on I
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.380]   wasn't going to be a musician.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.100]   I still have absolutely no ability to read music.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.920]   I can memorize the lyrics very easily.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.340]   And I love music.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.480]   And I love classical music as well as other forms of music.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.360]   But zero musical talent.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.220]   You, on the other hand, got quite good at violin.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.380]   It was interesting for me to learn that the violin was
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.320]   a bit of a rebellious choice for you given your family history.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.980]   And you and I do both share this fairly unusual fact
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.380]   that both of our fathers are theoretical physicists.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.320]   So did you feel pressured to be a scientist or something else?
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.220]   And being a musician, was that initially looked
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.180]   at as a route to poverty or a bad choice?
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.040]   Or were your parents a bit more cautious?
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.000]   Like, oh, OK, that's great.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.520]   But maybe make that a supplement to your other studies
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.540]   and pursuits?
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.240]   Yeah, so I'm the youngest of four kids.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.040]   And kind of stereotypically, my three older siblings
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.240]   were total math whizzes.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.160]   They were taking the SAT when they were very young
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.480]   because they were so talented.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.200]   But I think one antagonist to some of those cultural forces
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.760]   is that my mom, when she had grown up in India,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.480]   had felt very stifled by her environment.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.840]   Like, as a young woman who is very capable and very smart--
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.160]   I mean, she majored in physics--
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.500]   she was mostly kept to the spaces of domestic chores,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.860]   occasional singing lessons.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.900]   But mostly, her job was like, do your homework
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.000]   and then help with cooking and cleaning and whatnot.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.700]   And so when she moved to this country with my dad
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.860]   in the 1970s, she was actually very excited.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.300]   She was 21 years old, by the way.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.620]   So long story short, she met my dad 20 days prior
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.700]   to their getting married.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.220]   So it was an arranged meeting.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:25.120]   And my dad is doing his postdoc at Harvard in physics
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.340]   at the Society of Fellows.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.140]   And my mom just joins him after a winter break in the dorm.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.260]   And everyone's like, hey, man, how was your break?
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.840]   And there's like, I went snowboarding.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.460]   And I went whatever, to Tahoe.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.680]   And my dad's like, I got married.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.840]   And so this new couple arrives.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.020]   And my mom was so lonely in this country.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.520]   I mean, this was before you could text your parents
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.360]   overseas or use a WhatsApp group.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.460]   So she could only handwrite letters to her family back home.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.360]   And her goal was, you know what?
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.200]   I'm going to create a little army around me
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.240]   in the form of children.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.880]   So she had four kids.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.920]   And she was absolutely intent on exposing us
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.320]   to as many extracurricular activities as she could.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.520]   So I have two older brothers.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.340]   And I have an older sister, especially her girls.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.960]   She said, you can do whatever you want.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.500]   Lay the land when you're young.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.840]   But when you find something that you're passionate about,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.220]   I really want to give you the opportunity to explore it.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.920]   And I think I really benefited from the fact
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.500]   that she had been denied that kind of exposure
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.980]   and the ability to pursue her dreams, artistic or otherwise.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.280]   And so she was really hell-bent on making sure
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.520]   that we kids were able to.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.360]   I think they were--
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.820]   I mean, my older three siblings played musical instruments,
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.560]   so like clarinet, trumpet, flute.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.440]   I think they were surprised by my affinity for it.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.080]   Because when I was six, my mom brought down my grandmother's
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   violin from the attic.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.360]   So my grandmother had played Indian classical music.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.200]   So that's where she was sitting cross-legged
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.240]   on the floor and your violin's facing the ground.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.920]   It's a very different style of music.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.680]   But as like a parting gift, my grandmother
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.380]   had given it to my mom and said, hey, bring this with you
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.540]   to the US.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.420]   So she opened the instrument that day.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.100]   And I just instantly fell in love with it.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:05.420]   And I asked very quickly for a quarter-size violin of my own.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.680]   And while my parents had to nudge
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.440]   me to do all sorts of things, they really
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.080]   never had to push me to practice,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.860]   which felt extraordinary at the time.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.960]   Like, OK, clearly the violin is something
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.120]   that Maya has intrinsic motivation for.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.360]   Because how is it that we're not asking her
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.480]   to have to practice all the time?
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.880]   Similar to you, actually, Andrew, I never--
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.200]   to this day, I have a really hard time reading music.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.480]   So I never-- I was a terrible sight reader.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.980]   I couldn't-- if you put a piece of music in front of me,
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.680]   I would not be able to tell you probably
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.120]   what it would sound like today.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.680]   I learned entirely by ear.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.980]   So I started with the Suzuki method, which, as you know,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.440]   is entirely by ear.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.600]   And then I had an extremely very kind, awesome,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.180]   but very inexperienced teacher.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.640]   I was his first student.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.800]   My mom went backstage at a symphony concert
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   in New Haven, which is where I grew up,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.760]   and just asked the concertmaster, like, hey,
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.880]   will you teach my daughter?
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.000]   And he's like, sure.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.600]   Never taught anyone before, but I'll give this a go.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.480]   And so we just made things up along the way.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.640]   I mean, he would play stuff, and I would mimic it.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.460]   And I would let my emotions and my whatever innate musicality
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.880]   guide me.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.160]   And eventually-- I mean, I think what that did actually
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.400]   is really interesting from a skill building perspective.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.080]   My technique absolutely suffered in the long term
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   from not having a more structured approach.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.920]   But I was able to fall in love with this endeavor much more
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.840]   quickly than other kids who had drill sergeants that
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.040]   were forcing them to, like, practice their scales every day
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   and practice A2s.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.640]   I mean, that stuff is so boring, right?
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.100]   And when you're a little kid, you just
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.600]   want to bang your head against the wall
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.060]   when you're put up against that one.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.500]   So there's so many barriers to actually enjoying
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.740]   the fun parts, which are actually playing the pieces.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.300]   So the one kind of fun aside about my musical journey
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.400]   is I got to jump straight to the fun stuff.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.840]   And I think that helped me cultivate a much more natural
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   love of the instrument.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.900]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.360]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.620]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.860]   that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.360]   needs.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.820]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.040]   and minerals through whole food sources that include
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.840]   vegetables and fruits every day.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.520]   But oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.540]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.320]   and the probiotics that I need.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.460]   And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.280]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.800]   I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.020]   And it also happens to taste great.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.440]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.600]   asked if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.200]   I answer, AG1.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.300]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.820]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.900]   From now until August 12, 2023, AG1
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.200]   is giving away 10 free travel packs plus a year's
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.460]   supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.860]   Again, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.520]   you can claim the special offer of 10 free travel
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.780]   packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.780]   The intrinsic motivation part is so key.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.980]   I've talked a few times before on the podcast about this,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.080]   I think, now famous study that was done at Bing Nursery
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.820]   School at Stanford, where they observed what kids did during
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.440]   free time.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.280]   And then they rewarded them or didn't reward them.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.040]   And then they later removed the rewards.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.160]   And the essential takeaway is that receiving rewards
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.040]   for something that a child was initially intrinsically
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.680]   motivated to do undermined some of that intrinsic motivation.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.360]   So I have to wonder whether or not
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.700]   the fact that your parents neither encouraged
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.800]   nor discouraged your violin playing
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.320]   might have allowed you to fully express and lean
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.120]   into your intrinsic motivation, as opposed to, for instance,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.920]   in my case, we are distantly related, not closely related.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.960]   But there is a great violinist by the name
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.860]   of Bronislav Huberman, who has a street named after him
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.360]   in Israel.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.740]   There's a famous picture of him and Einstein playing violin
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.240]   together.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.560]   And I was told about that early on.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.680]   And when I failed to play well after a couple of practices,
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.260]   I was convinced that there was no way
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.760]   I was going to live up to it.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.280]   And I quit.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.180]   That's a high bar, man.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.200]   It's a high bar.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.920]   It's a high bar.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.180]   I didn't have any such role models
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.680]   that I was trying to be like in my family.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   Yeah, it turns out I'm--
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.880]   but exactly.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.840]   And so I think that there's actually more opportunity
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.800]   in kids leaning into, and adults probably,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.840]   leaning into the sensory experience of what they're
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.960]   doing and not putting that up against some benchmark.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.480]   And I worry about that today so much with social media
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.120]   and with video games, where in a video game or on social media,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.200]   you can see something being done at the very highest level,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.960]   often by someone quite young or early in their career,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.240]   to the point where it can be a little bit overwhelming.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.960]   And I think then we start measuring ourselves
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.920]   against metrics that are not about the experience.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.840]   That said, your parents, whatever they did,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.940]   worked out well enough that you became very proficient.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.840]   You succeeded in getting into Juilliard,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.560]   which is, at least from my understanding,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.240]   is the most competitive music preparatory.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.160]   Is that how you refer to it?
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   That one can possibly go to.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.440]   And so at that point, had your identity
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.920]   merged with the behavior, and were you still
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.960]   enjoying yourself up until the point
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.640]   where you had this injury that we'll also talk about?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.680]   Yeah, I was still enjoying myself
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.160]   around the time when I auditioned
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.400]   for Juilliard in particular because of exactly what you
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.000]   said, which was everything was kind of beating
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.360]   my expectations and my parents' expectations
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.560]   up until this point, which is that we didn't really have any.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   And so it all just felt like icing on the cake.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.840]   Wow, our kids found something that they really love.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.720]   This is great, right?
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.680]   It can sometimes take you years, decades
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.280]   to figure out what it is that you love,
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.200]   what you're passionate about.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.120]   And I think we go through this renewal process
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.040]   often in our lives, right?
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.480]   I've had to have moments in life where I'm like,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.400]   what do I like again?
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.600]   What do I love again?
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.640]   And so it's not also a one-time experience.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.180]   But there was a thrilling aspect to my musical life
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.520]   when I was young, which is, again, everything kind of felt
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.180]   like bonus.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.020]   So one story I love sharing is about how I even got
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.300]   into Juilliard in the first place.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.520]   My parents-- so my dad's a theoretical physicist,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.440]   as you mentioned.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.380]   My mom helps immigrants get green cards
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.820]   to study in this country.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.020]   Neither of them had exposure to the classical music sphere,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:14.540]   right?
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.320]   So they're like the opposite of tiger parents.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.860]   Like, even if they wanted to be tiger parents,
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.480]   they wouldn't know how to be tiger parents in this domain
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.400]   because they lack the connections and the wherewithal
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.680]   to figure out what it would mean to go pro and to access
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.920]   the best teachers or whatever.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.940]   So my mom, who is a very fearless person by nature,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.000]   she knew that at some point, my passion for the violin
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.300]   was surpassing her ability to connect me
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.860]   with the right resources.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.240]   And so one weekend, we were in New York,
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.900]   all inspiring New York.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.740]   And I had my violin with me because I had another audition.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.140]   And we were just walking by Juilliard, the building.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.640]   And my mom was just eager for me to see it from the outside
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.060]   because it's just really cool as a kid, right?
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.220]   It's like all your musical idols went to this place.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.220]   I just wanted to see it and imagine
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.480]   what it would have been like for Pearlman to go in and out
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.680]   and Midori to go in and out.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.080]   It was Yo-Yo Ma, right?
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.480]   It was so exciting.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.080]   And as we're passing the entrance,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.880]   my mom looks at me and says, hey, why don't we just go in?
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.900]   I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.280]   She's like, let's just go in.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.960]   What's the worst thing that can happen?
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.780]   And I'm like, security guards and a lot of other terrible
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.380]   things, mom, right?
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.900]   But I had a youthful enthusiasm that propelled me
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.300]   into the building that day.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.520]   She strikes up a conversation with a fellow student.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.260]   And her mom finds out that she's studying with a top teacher
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.200]   at Juilliard, asks if we can get an introduction.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.420]   Within an hour, I'm auditioning for this teacher on the spot,
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.140]   right?
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.720]   No idea that this was going to happen.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.780]   Wild.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.620]   Yeah, he tells me--
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.020]   he has what I prefer to as a muted enthusiasm
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.800]   about my playing.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.040]   Doesn't think I'm great, but see something.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.520]   He told me later he liked my personality, my enthusiasm.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.400]   So I got the personality card coming out
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.480]   of that music audition.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.920]   Great.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.520]   And what he did is he said, look, I'm with you.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.900]   I don't think that you're ready.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.880]   You would not get into Juilliard if you auditioned today.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.080]   However, I take residence at a summer music program
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:13.960]   in Colorado.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   If you come there for five weeks,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.300]   we can do an intense boot camp where I try to skill you up
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.860]   and get you to learn your first scale and your first etude,
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.940]   which you will need to pass the Juilliard audition
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.660]   and also maybe hopefully get you to read music a little bit
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.540]   better than you can right now.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:33.420]   And I went to that summer camp, and I worked my butt off.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.860]   I mean, you're also in this incredibly intensive
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.140]   environment where everyone your age is there,
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.400]   and they're all practicing their age equivalent, right?
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.940]   And so I felt very inspired by that.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.000]   And I ended up getting into Juilliard in the fall.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.920]   And it was such a wonderful reminder
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.640]   that when opportunities are not served
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.560]   on a silver platter for you, you just
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.960]   have to have this kind of imaginative courage
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.200]   and what my mom had that day to figure out a path from point A
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.560]   to point B. She really just created a plate for me
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.480]   and said, OK, you're prepared for this thing.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.440]   We're going to get you in front of this teacher.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.600]   And that's a lesson I use time and time again
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.820]   when I felt like there was something cool I could be doing.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.340]   The opportunity did not exist.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.300]   So for example, when I was in the White House,
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.720]   the job that I wanted, which was to be
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.420]   a practitioner of behavioral science, did not exist.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.080]   And so I sent cold emails, and I pitched them
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.460]   on the idea of creating a new position for a behavioral
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.440]   science advisor.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.860]   And then I said, hey, by the way,
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.560]   if you create this position, could you
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.220]   also consider hiring me to play that job,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.040]   even though I've had no public policy experience
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.800]   and I've been an academic for the entirety of my adult life?
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.440]   And they said yes.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.220]   And so it was such an energizing lesson
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.280]   to learn as a young kid, which is you can do the cold call.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.160]   Oftentimes, there's few consequences.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.200]   You'll just get rejected.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.000]   I mean, that's truly the worst thing that's going to happen.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.620]   But it's one thing to be told that.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.940]   It's another thing to have lived the experience out
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.680]   and to see how amazing the aftermath can be.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.620]   And that's what I got to experience as a young kid.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.160]   - Amazing, and so let's all express some thanks to your mom
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.760]   for barging in the door.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.280]   And to you, because you also had the agency
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   to do the audition on the spot.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.800]   I think a lot of kids and adults would have thought,
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.660]   I'm not ready, I'm not going to do this.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.660]   But it takes a certain gumption to just do it, right?
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.860]   And also to integrate the feedback.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.120]   And then I'm curious about this camp.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.340]   I went to a few camps of different types,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.440]   crashed a few camps, that's a different story.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.600]   Turns out if you show up, you can get by for a few days
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.560]   before they realize that you're not one of the main,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.960]   oh yeah, no, there's a whole other set of stories there.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.320]   - I love it, Andrew.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   - But I'm curious, you're among very driven,
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.880]   maybe even obsessive kids.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.840]   Were they nice to one another?
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.400]   Do you recall the kid that was the best?
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.560]   - Oh yeah, Rachel Lee.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.160]   - There you go, isn't this incredible?
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.000]   - Oh my God.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.840]   - How we remember these names.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.280]   - Yeah, total prodigy.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.440]   I bristle when people say like,
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.380]   oh, like Maya was a young violin prodigy.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.940]   I'm like, no, I wasn't.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.600]   And there's no false humility in my saying that.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.560]   I just actually saw what prodigies were like
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.000]   and I was not one of them.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.660]   I mean, truly just talk about awe inspiring.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.440]   I'm like, how is it that music comes
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.880]   so effortlessly to Rachel?
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.040]   I feel like she was born with a violin in her hands.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.560]   I mean, that's how it felt whenever I watched her play.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.160]   And it's a double-edged sword.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.600]   On the one hand, you're driving inspiration
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.080]   from the incredible talent you see around you.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.680]   On the other hand, you feel demoralized so often
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.640]   because you're running up against whatever limitations exist
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.600]   when it comes to your natural talent and your work ethic.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.440]   Like at the end of the day,
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.260]   I was never the hardest working violinist.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.340]   My mom insisted that we were well-rounded kids.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.640]   I played soccer all through elementary school.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.800]   I auditioned for the school play, "Really Rosie."
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.780]   I did art classes.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.640]   It was just really important to both my parents, I think,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.520]   that we had just relatively normal lives.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.220]   And I was studying alongside kids
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.760]   who had literally left half their families behind
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.520]   in their home country, had moved with one parent
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.740]   to a studio apartment in Manhattan
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.320]   or in Colorado for this camp,
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.760]   and were devoting their entire lives to this pursuit.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.680]   And so I felt like I was a super envious kid.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.980]   Like I was always looking around being like,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.400]   "I suck and they're great," right?
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.360]   We talked about like having a self-critical personality.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.400]   - I think a lot of kids feel that way.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.980]   I think at that age,
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.120]   and this sometimes extends into adulthood,
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.840]   we have this tendency to try and find benchmarks
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.120]   of where we are, you know?
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:59.300]   And sometimes that turns into a hierarchical thing,
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.540]   sometimes very lateralized, but trying to figure out
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   where you are in the landscape of things is,
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.720]   it just seems like it's kind of fundamental
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.240]   to the teenage experience.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.400]   - Yeah, and your universe shrinks too, right?
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.080]   So like you're no longer getting access
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.880]   to what the average kid violinist sounds like.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.400]   I mean, you're in the elite of the elite,
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.420]   and so it's so intimidating.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.260]   And I often felt, I felt like what happened is,
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.880]   especially when I became a teenager,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.640]   so two things happened when I became a teenager.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.480]   The first is that my violin life just started
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.380]   to speed forward.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.480]   So it's like Pearlman invited me
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.400]   to be his private violin student, you know,
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.100]   considered the best violinist in the world.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.560]   It was an incredible experience.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.280]   I felt so overwhelmed even by the opportunity.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.080]   I'd also stumbled upon MTV and was like,
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.560]   do I even want to do classical music?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.520]   Like Britney Spears is doing much cooler things.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   So that was my version of like teenage rebellion
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.860]   was coming home from school
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.760]   and what I should have been practicing watching MTV.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   But the other thing that happened is
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.120]   I went through the natural teenage process,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.780]   which is I became very self-conscious.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.240]   I became more insecure.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.060]   I was trying to figure out who I was, who I am.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   And I think that was the period of my life,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.320]   my high school years,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.260]   when I was the least happy as a violinist.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.480]   So I described to you earlier
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.860]   that incredibly awe-inspiring experience
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.040]   of listening to the Beethoven Violin Concerto
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.720]   and it feeling other worldly
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.600]   and feeling like I could see a world
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.120]   beyond my own personal wants and needs and desires, right?
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.440]   Really made me feel small against the backdrop
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.760]   of this magnificent world.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.160]   And I liked that feeling of smallness.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.000]   And when I was in my teenage years,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   we're all in this highly narcissistic state of mind.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.440]   We're like consumed with ourselves and how we feel.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.860]   And I just felt like I gave some of my worst performances
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.840]   when I was a teenager.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.080]   And I often found to your point
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.200]   about these pressure cooker environments,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.080]   my best performance were actually just to the public.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.240]   My worst performances were when I was in my little studio
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.060]   having to play for my peers.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.120]   Like that's just sapped all the joy out for me
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.900]   because I was, yeah, just like really tough on myself.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.740]   And I lost, that was a period of time where I lost touch
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.540]   with what it is that I loved about music.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.200]   And of course there's an ebb and flow.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.440]   I had magical experiences playing the violin
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.420]   when I was a high schooler,
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.040]   but I just think if you were to do like the average of joy,
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.200]   like pre 12 and then post 12,
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.960]   the average joy was much higher before I became a teenager.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   - Yeah, there's so many things to extrapolate from that.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.800]   I really feel that when we get into a mode
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.820]   of trying to hit milestones that are extrinsic,
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.640]   that it really can undermine our love of what we're doing.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.760]   But if we keep going and we can reframe
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.600]   what those external rewards are,
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.200]   in part by just realizing that they're so transient
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.260]   compared to the delight that we can experience.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.140]   What I mean is that I don't think of delight
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.520]   as something that wells up in us and then dissipates.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.540]   I think of it as something that changes our nervous system
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.660]   in a way that gives us access to new abilities.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.500]   I really do.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.000]   I mean, being a faculty member at Stanford,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.660]   you know, you look to your left, you look to your right.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.300]   And it's like, I literally in the building,
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.520]   I mean, I've got a Nobel prize winner below me.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.580]   Like the people buy a MacArthur award winners
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.060]   all over the place, like everywhere you turn.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.980]   And these people do other things too.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.520]   So they're like, you know, oh no, also D1 athletes.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.580]   And they've got five kids
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.120]   and all their kids seem to be doing great.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.360]   They're like, who are these people?
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.480]   And it becomes very important in that environment
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.160]   to just shrink your spirits.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.520]   Like what's, you know, one foot in front of you
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.120]   and just keep going and not pay attention.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.840]   But it's hard to do, not by way of comparison.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.560]   'Cause I actually get excited about being immersed
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.880]   in a group of where everyone's doing well.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.180]   I do think being among all these other incredibly talented
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.120]   and driven, although you carefully said,
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.760]   and importantly said rather,
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   that you did not see yourself as talented.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.920]   It's very clear that you have a ton of grit
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   and hard work clearly went into it.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.520]   I think that word talent can be a little bit misleading.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.980]   So we wanna underscore the fact
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.920]   that you've worked incredibly hard.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.240]   But I think that it's a tough thing.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.180]   You know, it's hard for us to develop much in isolation
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.980]   and it's also hard for us to stay connected to the source.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.480]   - Yes, the source, exactly.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.200]   - And that's a word that I stole from a former guest
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.080]   on this podcast and a good friend of mine
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.440]   who's the great Rick Rubin,
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.360]   one of the most successful music producer
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.800]   rock and roll music producer involved.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.600]   He talks about the source, you know.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.360]   So there are so many different trails
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.180]   we could go down here.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.960]   Just one thing briefly is I, again,
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.320]   completely miserable at music,
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.080]   but I once saw Itzhak Perlman in the airport
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   with his family.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.020]   I was with my father, who's a huge classical music fan.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.800]   And we watched him and he said, "Watch."
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   And it turns out he was getting onto our plane.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.600]   He sat in first class next to his,
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.000]   I presume, Stradivarius violin.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.240]   His violin got a first class seat.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.600]   He got a first class seat
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.400]   and his family sat across from him.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.920]   And my dad said, "His violin is so important
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.880]   "that it gets its own first class seat."
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.440]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.280]   - So great.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.120]   - So in any event.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.100]   - I think just one thing to your point,
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.880]   one reflection I've had,
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.120]   and this kind of goes back to this question of identity,
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.680]   right, which is when you are
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.300]   in these very competitive environments,
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.640]   and again, I'm sure a lot of people listening
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.300]   are in very competitive environments,
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.220]   you feel that so much can be taken away from you,
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.100]   just in terms of mental wellbeing,
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.300]   because you're always looking at the world
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.780]   through a comparative lens, right?
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.620]   You're benchmarking yourself, as you said.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.840]   Like there's benchmark and where do I fall
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.460]   on the continuum of mediocre to great, I don't know.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.320]   And yesterday I had a terrible performance,
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.260]   so that's gonna set me back, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.340]   I have found that when I've anchored,
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.440]   when I re-anchor myself to what Rick Rubin referred to
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.140]   as the source, and identify the characteristics of music
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.640]   or other pursuits that really energizes me,
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.040]   it feels like I'm actually insulated
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.320]   from a lot of the external noise,
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.020]   and I bring a lot more clarity and focus
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.140]   to the work that I do every day.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.480]   So there's two things that I think define me as a person,
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.280]   at least right now, right, I allow for that malleability.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.220]   One is that I'm a deeply curious person,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.920]   and the second is that I really relish
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.200]   getting better at things.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.100]   I love seeing progress internally.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:26.760]   And in my violin life,
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.420]   no one could take those two things away from me.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.260]   In my current life, as a cognitive scientist,
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.560]   as a podcaster, like you just can't take those from me.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.640]   Like no one can take that joy from me.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.480]   And it feels protective in a really important way,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.080]   which is, for example, I mean, I pour,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.140]   I mean, just like you, I mean, I see the labor of love
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.700]   that you put into the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.540]   It's extraordinary.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.240]   I put so much time and energy and thoughtfulness and love
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.320]   into making a slight change of plans.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.160]   But at the end of the day,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.820]   when you put the episode out into the world,
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.540]   you just don't get to control what the reaction is, right?
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.900]   Your favorite episode
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.860]   might not be everyone else's favorite episode,
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.920]   and that's just something you have to deal with, right?
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.140]   But what I found is that if I really relish the process
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.680]   of making the episode, right, it fed that curiosity,
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.840]   and I got better.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.640]   As an interviewer, I got better as a thinker.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.080]   I got more clarity on a topic that I was curious about.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.420]   I mean, it just, it gives me a foundation
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.120]   that feels really sturdy.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:24.960]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.880]   It's just, yeah.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.200]   - Well, those things are intrinsic to you,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.720]   and they are, I guess now we're using nomenclature,
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.280]   but they're not what we would call domain-specific.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.920]   Like the curiosity, the desire for progress
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.140]   through effort and through focus,
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.340]   those are music, they're not music irrelevant,
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.920]   but they're music independent.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:50.700]   And that actually brings me to a very important component
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.420]   of your work and your life arc,
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.620]   which is this notion of recreating
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:02.040]   and refinding identity in new endeavors.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.160]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.540]   and hopefully you'll embellish on this,
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.740]   you had the unfortunate, perhaps unfortunate, right?
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.520]   Experience of playing the violin
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.140]   and then injuring your finger very badly
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.100]   to the point where it was,
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.860]   at least for your music career, career ending.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.740]   - Absolutely.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.060]   - And that happened when you were how old?
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.420]   - I was 15.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.460]   - So given how much of your identity
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.340]   and energy was put into violin,
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.680]   that must've been devastating.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.600]   And yet you obviously, I don't want to say recreated yourself
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.860]   because I like the idea that this essence within you
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.740]   has many opportunities and forms.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.020]   And I like it as an example for everybody
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.700]   having some essence of many things
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.100]   that could give them delight.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.220]   And that it's something about the feelings associated
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.420]   with a given choice of occupation or hobby or behavior,
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.740]   or perhaps relationship, right?
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   Relationships end sometimes by decision, death,
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.380]   or otherwise, and people are devastated.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.100]   Their identities are completely,
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.740]   at least in their minds, obliterated.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.060]   And then people have this amazing ability
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.200]   to recreate themselves and new circumstances.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.100]   So if you could take us back to the time when you were 15,
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.860]   you have this injury, what was your initial mindset
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.900]   in the days and weeks after that?
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.620]   And then if you would, could you link that up to some of the,
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.020]   what I see as incredibly important work that you've done,
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.060]   helping people understand not just who they are,
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.900]   but how to identify the components of who they are
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.240]   that are truly indomitable, that just cannot go away,
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.340]   like your drive for curiosity and hard work.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.740]   - And human connection, yep.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:49.320]   Yeah, in the days and weeks and months and year after,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.340]   I felt terrible.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:56.420]   It was awful because I don't, I think in my case also,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.220]   you just, when you're a kid who's really like bubbly
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.100]   and energetic, you just kind of move forward
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.900]   and you don't always think about how identity defining
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.780]   the thing you're doing is, you just do it.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.900]   And so it was really interesting,
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.500]   I think in losing the violin,
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.700]   that's actually when it became so salient to me,
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.740]   how much the instrument had meant to me
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.620]   and had defined who I was.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:22.620]   And so I felt a dampening of some of my more organic traits,
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:27.020]   like I was less curious for a long time.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.100]   - Could I, I'm gonna interrupt you on purpose.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.140]   I apologize, but at the same time, I'm not apologizing
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.300]   'cause there was something that you said
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.160]   in a prior discussion that just keeps ringing in my mind,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.820]   which is that your body and your nervous system
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.860]   actually grew up around the violin.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.540]   Like that to me was just, I will never forget that statement
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.020]   and I wanna also thank you for it
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.100]   because that to me is perhaps the most profound way
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.340]   to describe an experience of identity
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.780]   is that your nervous system and your body
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.340]   isn't growing up with something or alongside it,
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.260]   but that much like a relationship of a human kind,
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.380]   human humankind, that your body is actually developing
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.620]   around this object.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.180]   - It absolutely developed around the ergonomics
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.260]   of playing the violin.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.380]   So to this day, my right shoulder is slightly elevated
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.060]   to my left, relative to my left
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.460]   because of all the hours I spent doing this.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.580]   It makes strength training really annoying
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.260]   because I always have this slight imbalance
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.980]   and I have a light scoliosis in my spine as well,
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.740]   also from this posture.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.140]   And yeah, it feels intimate in a way.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.700]   It's like, wow, the shape of my body, right?
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:41.700]   Like my architecture was defined by this instrument.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:47.020]   And so it's left this indelible, you know,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.940]   it has this like imprint on me that will never go away.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:56.940]   And I think that a lot of us feel this disorientation, right?
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.660]   So it might not be that you lost the ability
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.580]   to do something you love.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.660]   It could be that you lost someone that you love, right?
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.660]   It could be that you lost your mojo or whatever, right?
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.540]   I mean, there's so many types of loss
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.180]   and so many kinds of grief we all experience
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:16.460]   as human beings.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.140]   And I think in all those cases, again,
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.900]   it really feels like the rug has been pulled out
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.220]   from under you because this thing
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.100]   that gave you so much meaning and so much purpose
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.380]   and so much energy in life no longer exists.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.900]   And so I think for a while, yeah,
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.540]   I felt kind of like lost at sea
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.220]   and I assumed I'll never find anything
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.060]   that I'm as passionate about.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.940]   And I think what my dad did for me at that time,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.540]   so, you know, theoretical physicist,
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.660]   so he's an academic and he said,
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.460]   "I think you should just read a lot.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.620]   Just like read a bunch of stuff."
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.860]   And I was like, okay, I mean,
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.340]   I'm supposed to be in China this summer
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.660]   touring with my classmates.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.460]   I am at home in Connecticut with my parents,
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.420]   perusing their bookshelves.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.300]   So like slightly less cool summer situation,
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.940]   but, you know, I had a lot of time on my hands
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.420]   'cause I wasn't in Shanghai.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.100]   So I started, you know, perusing the bookshelf
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.660]   and then I came across this pop science book
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.860]   called "The Language Instinct" by Steven Pinker.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:18.500]   And that was a turning point for me.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.140]   I mean, I was headed to college maybe later that year.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.260]   I opened up this book and it detailed
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:32.900]   our marvelous ability to comprehend and produce language.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.660]   And up until this point in my life,
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:38.140]   I had completely taken language abilities for granted,
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.860]   just like something that I did.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   And I just like kind of learned it along the way.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.420]   And when Pinker pulled the curtain back
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.060]   and revealed how sophisticated and complex
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.340]   the cognitive machinery is
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.660]   that's operating behind the scenes
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.700]   that gives rise to language, my mind was truly blown.
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.700]   I was like, wow, I never thought about it.
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.100]   It's not like we, with three-year-olds,
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.380]   not like we sit down with them and we're like,
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.780]   this is a gerund, this is a passport, whatever.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.300]   There's no, they just learn
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.500]   because they have these kind of light switches
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.420]   in their brain that are, you know, activated on and off
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.020]   depending on what language they're learning.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:16.300]   And it was so fascinating to learn about language development
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.580]   about neuro-linguistics, about syntax and semantics.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.500]   And so I just remember thinking language is fascinating.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.020]   Cognition is fascinating.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.500]   And I'm also now wondering
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.420]   about all these other systems that are in place, right?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.980]   So this is what's involved in language,
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.220]   what's involved in, you know,
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.100]   the complex math equations our dads do, right?
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.980]   Like what's involved in, what's the mental processing
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.820]   behind a new discovery or an insight or an aha moment
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.660]   or falling in love or falling out of love?
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.140]   I mean, it just lit up my imagination.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.540]   And very similar to you, Andrew,
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.220]   I love that we have this connection.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.900]   You said when you learned about like neurobiology
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.820]   and neuroscience, you saw that there was a place
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.900]   for yourself in there.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.300]   And I remember reading this book
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.940]   and because it was a pop science book
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.060]   and I love pop science books 'cause sometimes, you know,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.780]   even if they don't fully do justice to the science,
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.580]   they can take someone who's never had any exposure
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.940]   to the subject matter.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.700]   And it's thrilling to learn about the thing, right?
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.580]   I would never have gotten the same experience
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.500]   had I opened up an introduction
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.060]   to cognitive science textbook, okay?
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.540]   It would not have had the same impact on me.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.540]   So like shout out to pop science books everywhere.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.580]   - Thank you for saying that.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.820]   And you know, and here I'll just thank you
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.460]   because I think that many of my colleagues
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.540]   in academic science at Stanford and elsewhere
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.160]   feel that way, but I think many don't.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.740]   They think of it as quote, "Dumbing down of things."
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.880]   But I'll tell you, rarely, if ever,
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.760]   does somebody just wander into a university classroom
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.840]   and hear a lecture on accident.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.140]   I mean, maybe if your mom was at the helm,
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:47.980]   they all would.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.080]   So mom's everywhere, barge right in.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.160]   But I think it's, I actually, I'll go a step further
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.480]   and I'll do this so that you don't have to.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.160]   And these are not your words, these are mine.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.300]   I think that there's actually a pretty intense arrogance
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.160]   to the idea within the established scientific community
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.060]   that pop science books, while they might not be exhaustive,
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.060]   provided they're accurate and they're making an attempt
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.060]   to educate and draw people in from all sectors,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.500]   like, amen to that.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.420]   I just can't hear a counterargument in my head or elsewhere
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.600]   where that's not one of the best things that people can do.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.600]   So regardless of, you know, people's motivations
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.180]   for picking them up in the first place,
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.080]   I mean, they brought a lot of people into the curiosity
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.720]   and delight that is science or music, or, you know,
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.400]   I think that we, the more positive, benevolent, you know,
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.320]   safe sensory experiences that we can expose young people to,
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.080]   the greater probability that we're gonna flesh out
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.120]   those professions with the greatest number of diverse minds
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.080]   who are gonna have the best ideas.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.600]   I mean, it's really, I think that there's a ton of foresight
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.340]   in what you're describing that, you know, picking up a book
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:07.180]   is now what you're also now a PhD in, I mean,
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.500]   in cognitive science and you did your postdoc at Stanford.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.900]   I mean, you're a scientist, presumably because you went
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.100]   into the bookshelf and picked up that book.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.080]   - 100%, and I think it was also role modeled for me
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.220]   because my dad, despite being in a very, very technical
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.580]   field, spent a large part of his career actually working
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.620]   on the translation of complex subjects
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.960]   and trying to convey them to general audiences.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.660]   And I loved witnessing this 'cause it's like,
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.960]   if you can figure out a way to communicate
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.000]   about theoretical physics to a general audience,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.600]   I mean, wow, that's a masterful pursuit, right?
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.640]   - Well, Feynman, Richard Feynman.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.100]   - Yeah, Richard Feynman, exactly.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.680]   - No one really knows what Feynman did
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.180]   for his Nobel Prize work except physicists.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.420]   You know that most people you ask them,
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.100]   what was Feynman's Nobel for?
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.580]   And they're like, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.380]   He said something about birds and taxonomy
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.140]   and how it's less interesting than quantum mechanics.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.220]   - Yeah, and one of the reasons that I love Huberman Lab
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.560]   and I just love the work you do is that you are taking
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.800]   concepts that might've been inaccessible
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.900]   to the average person and you're making science accessible.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   And I feel so much gratitude to every scientist out there,
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.780]   every researcher out there who thinks that
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.660]   it's worth their time to be a practitioner of their work.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.940]   Because ultimately, I mean, think about how many lives
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.360]   you're changing through the show by trying to break down
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.540]   some of these more complicated things into concepts
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.700]   that people can understand and relate to
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.100]   and actually act on.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:37.780]   And it also reminds me, part of my job
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.940]   when I was in the Obama administration
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.780]   was translating insights from behavioral science,
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.820]   from cognitive science into interventions
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.920]   that my government agency colleagues could implement
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.380]   in the Department of Veterans Affairs
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.460]   and the Department of Defense, Department of Education.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.380]   And that same translation process
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.780]   was part of that effort too.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.620]   And I think it's really, really hard to do well.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.380]   I respect it so much.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:05.180]   I respect pop science writers who do a good job so much.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.660]   And yeah, I think it's a wonderful service.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.460]   They don't have to spend their time writing these books.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.820]   They could just publish more research papers,
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   which is the currency that academic institutions care about.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.900]   And so I see it as just like a public good
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:18.860]   of what they're doing.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.740]   - Yeah, I do too.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.020]   And right back at you because you're doing it as well.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.920]   And so we're all better off for it.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.660]   So thank you.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.780]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.460]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.840]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.320]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.860]   to help you better understand your body
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.760]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.080]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.420]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.620]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.220]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.240]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.140]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.280]   about hormones and so on,
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.580]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.360]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.260]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.260]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.440]   and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.220]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.500]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.800]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.000]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.660]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.220]   and energy regulation.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.660]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.460]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.980]   - So I want to go back to this injury to summer at home,
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.460]   to discovery of something new.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.020]   Was it at that point that you realized,
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.600]   ah, the feeling of excitement that I'm getting
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.300]   from learning about neuro-linguistics and related topics
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.860]   is somehow similar to the excitement
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.420]   that I was feeling about the violin,
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.180]   or maybe even superseded that excitement?
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.860]   I mean, at what point were you able to make the pivot
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:05.540]   with confidence that this is the new trajectory?
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.140]   And an important component of that
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.460]   that I'd like to understand is you also had to cut ties
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.300]   with the past, something that's very hard to do.
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.100]   I mean, I grew up with a number of kids
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.860]   who became very successful teen athletes, really.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.540]   And some of them, once they ceased to keep up
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.000]   or they had an injury or something,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.300]   their identity stayed attached to the past
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.340]   in a way that did not allow them to move forward.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.940]   Fortunately, many of them did find new identities
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.720]   in business or in other endeavors.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.960]   Some became quite successful.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.740]   But I've seen very often
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.740]   that when people achieve early success
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.500]   and then they hit a cliff,
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.900]   that it's very hard for them to part
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.600]   with that former identity.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.640]   There's one of the perils of early success.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.540]   I wouldn't say that it's superseded the excitement
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.060]   that I had with the violin.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.820]   I would say the quality of the excitement
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.180]   felt very different.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.060]   And that's actually important to convey
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.700]   'cause I think when someone loses the ability
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.460]   to have a passion, they're seeking
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.660]   exactly the same sensory experience,
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.780]   exactly the same high that they experienced
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.820]   the first time around.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.540]   And I think that's a really high bar.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.500]   And sometimes it's more of an apples
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.820]   and oranges type situation.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.700]   So with the violin, there was a really deep
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.820]   sensory aspect to the experience.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.260]   I mean, I felt things, right?
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.380]   You're playing and then you're feeling things emotionally.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.380]   And it all felt super visceral.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   And that was where the passion emerged from.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.220]   It was just this very visceral feeling
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.500]   of this is so beautiful and awesome and I love it.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.980]   With the cognitive science stuff,
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.580]   my intellectual brain was delighted.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.780]   And it's just like a different expression of passion, right?
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.920]   I think the big pressure test was not,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.460]   if I had held myself to the bar of,
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.740]   do I love this as much as the violin?
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.160]   There's no way that I would have been confident enough
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.980]   to pursue anything at that point.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.120]   So instead, I really think the question I asked myself
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.520]   at that time, which was a service to me
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.360]   in my more compromised psychology was,
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.900]   am I curious enough about this thing
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.960]   to ask more questions about it?
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.000]   Do I want to learn more?
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.120]   And I found naturally three days later,
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   I went to the library and I got another book
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.460]   on the cognitive science of language.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.740]   And then I got a book on the science of decision-making.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:34.700]   So there was curiosity and honestly, that was all I needed.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.440]   That was the little seedling that I needed to see
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.500]   if it could go somewhere more.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.260]   I took that as a very strong signal.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.200]   Like I care to learn more about this
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.220]   and I don't care to learn about everything, right?
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.800]   And I remember perusing the course book
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.280]   of my undergrad institution
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.880]   and they had a cognitive science major, which was awesome
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.600]   because not all schools had one at the time.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.280]   It was a very new major, it's interdisciplinary.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.200]   You approach questions of the mind
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.400]   from multiple perspectives.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.000]   So from the perspective of neuroscience, linguistics,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   philosophy, psychology, computer science, and anthropology.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.340]   So you're just like a bunch of different disciplines.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.740]   But that was when I thought,
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.300]   ooh, I can at least see if I can get into this major.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.540]   I remember it was like a selective major, it was selective.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.600]   And so I freaked out of course
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.980]   and had super imposter syndrome.
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.500]   It was like, I'm not gonna get in to the program.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.700]   But thankfully I got in and I think that's, yeah,
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.820]   that's where I was able to connect
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.100]   like this little seedling of curiosity
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:38.100]   to the actual pursuit of the thing, right?
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.280]   And that's a really important translation
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.340]   because there can often be a mismatch.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.260]   You're really passionate about something,
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.280]   but you actually hate the process, right?
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.260]   Like you hate the actual work that's involved
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.620]   in getting better at it.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.540]   And I was lucky in my undergrad because I fought my way,
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.040]   my mom's style, barging into classes
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.480]   that like really would only accept seniors or juniors.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.400]   And I was like, I'm a lowly freshman, but like accept me.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.840]   And I was able to run experiments on adults.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.280]   And I was actually able to see what it would be like
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.780]   to be a researcher, to ask novel questions
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.940]   and to get the delight that you feel, right?
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:14.780]   When you're in a lab
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.640]   and you're actually testing out new hypotheses.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.500]   And so it was really important that I saw
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.120]   that I not only was excited,
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.620]   but that I could actually enjoy parts of the process
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.960]   of getting better.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.180]   - I love your description of curiosity
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.680]   because it makes me think that in some way
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.360]   it has something to do with a deep motivation
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.340]   and desire to figure out what's next
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.540]   or what's around the corner
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.500]   without an emotional attachment to the outcome.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.140]   The curiosity is really just trying to figure out
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:44.580]   what's there as opposed to hoping
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.860]   that something specific is there.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.340]   And sometimes even the surprises are more exciting
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.680]   than our predictions.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.620]   I think the quote was initially from Dorothy Parker.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.820]   I think this is debated, but I think it was,
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.860]   the cure for boredom is curiosity.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.300]   There is no cure for curiosity.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.680]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.520]   I hadn't heard that.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.020]   - Yeah, I believe it was Dorothy Parker,
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.500]   sometimes misattributed to Agatha Christie,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.500]   but I think it was Dorothy Parker.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.740]   And what I love about it is that
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.940]   there's something about curiosity that when it's genuine,
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.860]   it's self-amplifying, it's an upward spiral
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.020]   because there is no end point, right?
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.580]   I mean, that's one of the things that you learn
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.020]   early in sciences, you learn, you test hypotheses,
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.620]   you get answers and you get more questions
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.800]   and you inform hypotheses and you do that until you die,
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.600]   basically, and they can be a little bit dark.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.120]   But when you think about it as a journey
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.180]   that it's just so much fun along the way,
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.640]   if you're just really interested
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.320]   in knowing what the answers are
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.280]   without getting too attached to the answers,
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.680]   it just feels like it just, even as I'm describing it now,
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.160]   it's like they just can just fill you up
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.480]   and it provides more energy for the next round
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.360]   and the next round.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.200]   And that really came through in your description
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.820]   of cognitive science.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.660]   I also find it interesting that
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.480]   you couldn't read sheet music, at least not very well.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.480]   You were so deeply immersed in an endeavor, violin playing,
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.860]   that is not of verbal language.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.220]   And then you went into a field that's about,
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:17.260]   or initially you were sparked an interest in a field
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.020]   through an understanding of verbal language.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.940]   And earlier you said that the thing that bridges the violin
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.220]   and what came next as a passion and pursuit
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.820]   was this desire for human connection.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.560]   At what point did you realize that?
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.220]   And here, I do wanna emphasize that
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.380]   while we're talking about your story,
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.920]   I hope, I can only imagine that people
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.180]   are starting to think about
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.760]   what are the intrinsic points of motivation
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.200]   for what they're doing and what they've done?
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.680]   Asking the sorts of questions that I hope everyone
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.420]   is asking, what is it really that motivates me
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.320]   to love this and to see a place for myself in that?
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.660]   'Cause those are ultimately, I think the questions
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.860]   that everyone should and can ask.
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:06.260]   - Yeah, it took me a really long time.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.960]   It's actually only been in the last few years
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.340]   that I've discovered this.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.820]   I discovered this as a result of creating
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.820]   a slight change of plans.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   So my desire to create the show
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.240]   came from a very personal place,
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.620]   which is that I'm terrified of change.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.600]   So even though I've had these formative experiences
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.200]   with change, I'm a creature of habit.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.780]   I'm willing to change my habits.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.800]   For example, I now take caffeine 90 minutes after I get up.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.000]   - How's that working for you?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.760]   - Very well, even today, okay, I'm a good disciple.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.040]   - Well, I like to think that people afford themselves
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   some flexibility.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.800]   If you gotta run to the airport,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.240]   60 to 90 are the occasional within 30 minutes
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.320]   if you have to, but nobody's perfect.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.160]   Nor should we strive to.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.600]   - I'm a student, so I'm willing to update my habits,
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.080]   but I'm a creature of habit.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.800]   And there's a couple reasons why we as humans
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.940]   are scared of change.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.220]   And I think one of them, which is incredibly relatable,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.920]   is that change is filled with a lot of uncertainty
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.080]   and we hate uncertainty.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.060]   We will go to irrational lengths to avoid uncertainty.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.800]   So one of my favorite studies coming out
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.480]   of cognitive sciences is one involving electric shocks.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.160]   And what they found is that people are far more stressed
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.240]   when they're told they have a 50% chance
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.440]   of getting an electric shock
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.200]   than when they're told they have a 100% chance
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.000]   of getting an electric shock.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.320]   So we would rather be sure, certain,
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.120]   that a bad thing is going to happen
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.920]   than to have to deal with any feelings
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.320]   of uncertainty and ambiguity, right?
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.360]   - That result, I love that you brought up that result.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.600]   It still is bewildering to me
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.780]   because when you think about it,
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.560]   a 100% trial to trial shock means you just,
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.120]   you have to take on the, okay, bring it,
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.680]   just bring it on kind of mentality.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.840]   But if you did that for every trial
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.880]   and then half of the trials, you don't get shocked.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.840]   You'd get the, we know there's a dopamine release
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.480]   from the lack of punishment.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.760]   So the ideal strategy is the same
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.160]   and yet somehow people are averse to the uncertainty.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.280]   - Yeah, we just, we don't like uncertainty.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.340]   Even though, again, the uncertainty is what drives
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.020]   that dopamine first, right?
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.780]   And yet we bristle certainly at that uncertainty.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.240]   And so I definitely am like, please, status quo, everyone.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.340]   We'd love the status quo.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:31.100]   Even when the status quo has been suboptimal, Andrew,
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.420]   I've been fine with the status quo.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.000]   So part of it came from my desire to figure out, okay,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.200]   how is it like a slight change of plans, right?
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.380]   It marries science and storytelling
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.160]   to help us figure out strategies for better managing change.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.960]   So I wanted to figure out how are people coming to terms
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.400]   with uncertainty?
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.060]   And one of the things that I realized,
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.380]   I learned from the guests on my show and also the scientists
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.560]   is there's this concept called cognitive closure.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.900]   And it is the need to arrive at clear,
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.400]   definitive answers to things, okay?
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.380]   It's basically opposite of this open-ended curiosity
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.120]   that you just described, which is with cognitive closure,
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.120]   you have a need to, you aren't indifferent
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.640]   towards what the answers are.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.840]   You aren't indifferent towards what the questions are.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.900]   You care about everything.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.740]   You care about micromanaging every part
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.760]   of the curious process from point A to point B.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.440]   And there's a lot of research showing that
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.760]   when we reduce our need for cognitive closure, right?
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.680]   When we come a little bit more open to the unbidden, right?
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.600]   Like to mystery, more open to awe-inspiring experiences,
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.160]   we can experience huge boosts in wellbeing.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.880]   And we can become a lot more resilient
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.800]   in the face of change.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800]   So that's something that I'm working on, which is like,
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.280]   okay, maybe I can reduce my need for cognitive closure.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.360]   And the other thing that I am starting to appreciate
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   is one reason that we kind of, we get changed wrong
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.480]   and we maybe fear it more than we should,
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.640]   is that when we anticipate what a change
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.280]   will be like in the future,
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.760]   we tend to imagine how our present day selves
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.000]   will respond to that future change, right?
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   So it's almost like a magic mirror.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.920]   It's Maya in present day, going through this mirror,
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.440]   comes out the other side.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   Two years from now, she's the one who's overcoming
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.080]   the challenges of a diagnosis or some other life change.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.020]   And what we forget is that the big changes in our lives
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.520]   can change us in pretty profound ways, right?
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.320]   And when we recognize, and we all fall prey
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.160]   to this illusion.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.380]   So it's called the end of history illusion.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.640]   So this is work by Dan Gilbert.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.880]   And basically what it says is we fully acknowledge
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.420]   that we've changed considerably in the past.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.520]   So you think back to your skateboard days, right?
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.000]   I think back to my high school days and I think,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.320]   oh my gosh, of course I've changed.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.480]   Like I would be embarrassed to listen to any interview
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.560]   I gave when I was younger, right?
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.840]   Like what were the thoughts I was even thinking?
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.720]   So we will see it, absolutely.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.080]   We were totally different 10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.000]   But when it comes to thinking about the future
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.680]   and projecting into the future,
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.360]   we are absolutely convinced that who we are right now
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:10.520]   in this moment is the person that's here to stay.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.160]   And that can lead us astray when it comes to thinking
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.280]   about how we will respond to change because we forget
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.120]   that there's actually a lot of wiggle room
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.360]   around who we become.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.160]   And to your point, I mean, I love the point
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.000]   you made about curiosity.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.120]   What that means is we wanna be curious
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.640]   not just about the things we do,
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.780]   we wanna be curious about ourselves.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:35.500]   One huge lesson that I've learned from the interviews
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.960]   that I've had on a slight change of plans
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.160]   is that I need to constantly be auditing myself
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.880]   through my change experience
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.560]   to figure out how I have changed.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.940]   Because when we experience change,
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.640]   it doesn't happen in a vacuum, right?
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.340]   So let's say I get a promotion
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.380]   or I enter into a relationship or I leave a relationship
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:57.960]   or some other, again, narrow slice of my life is altered.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.160]   We can think of that change as happening in a vacuum, right?
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.200]   As being confined to just the unique area of our life
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.120]   that that change exists in.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.740]   But of course we are incredibly complex creatures.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.760]   Our psychology is incredibly complex.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.280]   We live in these remarkably complex ecosystems.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.760]   Change in one area of our life
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.600]   will inevitably have spillover effects
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.520]   into all other parts of our lives
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.760]   in ways that are extremely hard to predict.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   And so, I think a lot of your listeners
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.920]   are familiar with the research showing
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.000]   we're really bad cognitive forecasters, right?
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.560]   We're bad at predicting what's gonna make us happy,
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.840]   what's gonna make us sad, how long we're gonna be sad,
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.280]   how long we're gonna be happy.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.200]   Well, one of the reasons for that
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.740]   is that we forget that we are a dynamic entity
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.400]   that might change as well, right?
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.220]   That our preferences might change,
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.000]   our choice sets might change.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.240]   We might change in these really profound ways
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.080]   that we don't realize.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.860]   And I think there's an inspiring message coming out of this,
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.320]   which is one, like what we're capable of right now
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.240]   really might not be what we're capable of later.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.900]   And what I found in my own experience is that,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.680]   you know, when it comes to our, it's interesting,
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.760]   when it comes to our self-perception,
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.720]   because we have a first person perspective on who we are,
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.960]   we tend to think that we have a very comprehensive,
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.800]   like veridical understanding of who we are, right?
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.500]   Like I have a pretty good grasp of who I, Maya am
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.400]   and what I'm capable of and what I value
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.980]   and what my identity is.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.920]   But the reality is that that understanding
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.260]   is based on the random set of data points
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.100]   that I've happened to collect over the course of my lifetime
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.360]   based on the random set of experiences and opportunities
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.860]   and failures and successes that I've happened to have.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.700]   Right?
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.460]   - And if I'm not mistaken,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:47.220]   there's a salience to the negative experiences often.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.060]   - Absolutely.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.920]   - For reasons that make sense according to nervous systems
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.720]   that want to keep us safe, et cetera.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.520]   But for instance, you remember the name
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.840]   of this child prodigy.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.680]   - Rachel Lee.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.520]   - Rachel Lee.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.880]   My sister still talks about, I won't say their names
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.500]   because we know that these people are still around,
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:05.360]   unfortunately, the names of some of the girls
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.600]   in junior high school that were particularly popular
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.440]   and perhaps not kind.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.280]   - You mean Kellen, Lindsay, and Jacqueline?
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.100]   - Yeah, perhaps not kind to her.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:13.940]   - Oh no, I remember them.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.780]   - Right, exactly.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.620]   Perhaps not kind.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.440]   - Were they nice to me?
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.280]   Not super nice, but it's okay.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.080]   - Yeah, there's a lot of web searching nowadays
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.640]   for what these people are up to now.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.920]   Anyway, not by me.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.640]   This is, anyway, I have a sister.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.460]   We occasionally touch into this.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.720]   She's doing great, fortunately.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.620]   So yeah, there's a salience to the negative experiences,
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.060]   but I think what I'm hearing, and I totally agree with,
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:40.220]   is that we'd like to think that we have complete
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.620]   or at least adequate self-knowledge,
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.160]   but that we likely don't.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.580]   And so what are some of the ways
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.160]   that we can get better data on ourselves
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.580]   in ways that can help us?
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.160]   Is that through the application of mentorship?
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.660]   Is it asking people for an honest assessment of us
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:01.520]   with, of course, the willingness to hear
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.620]   what they have to say?
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:07.160]   What are some of the, I love zero-cost behavioral,
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.540]   but what are some of the zero-cost behavioral sources
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:14.420]   that people have around them in order to ask these
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.380]   what I think are really fundamental questions?
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.040]   - Yeah, so there's two information asymmetries,
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.520]   let's say, that we're trying to solve for, right?
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.980]   So two areas where we might not have full knowledge
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.400]   of who we are for one of two reasons.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.180]   So one is that we have an incomplete understanding
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.580]   of who we are just based on the random set of experiences.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.760]   And the second is that going through this big change
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.780]   actually alters us in some way, okay?
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.400]   So if we're trying to solve for the,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.900]   I think the second problem is actually easier to solve for
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.900]   in that we often just don't even know to look inwards
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.140]   during a big change to see how we've changed
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.060]   because we think, oh, I'll just pay attention
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.340]   to how I'm performing at work
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.580]   'cause that was the new variable
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:54.700]   that was thrown into my life.
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.540]   And we forget to evaluate other parts of our lives,
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.980]   like what impact has this had on my relationship?
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.820]   What impact has this had on my overall wellbeing, right?
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:03.660]   Am I different?
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:04.760]   Do I have a different set of preferences?
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.820]   Do I care about different things?
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:09.700]   So in the second category, become very inquisitive
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.300]   about who you are over a longer timeframe
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.680]   and assume that it's not a static state.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.540]   When it comes to the first bucket,
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.360]   which is how do we develop a more complete
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.460]   and richer understanding of self?
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.520]   I think it's actually about surrounding yourself
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.300]   with a diverse set of people,
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.540]   people that you wouldn't naturally gravitate towards.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.500]   I think this solves for a bunch of social ills,
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.960]   which is that, again, we tend to live in our silos, right?
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.720]   And we're really averse to talking to people
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.240]   who have different points of view.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.640]   But I will tell you, at times,
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.060]   I've learned the most about myself.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.380]   I've learned the most about my weaknesses
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.180]   and sometimes my strengths from talking with someone
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.180]   that I vehemently disagree with.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.080]   And it's a really hard thing to do.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.520]   It's very painful.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.460]   But in terms of like edifying experiences go,
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.900]   it's through those conversations
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.340]   that I almost see this mirror reflected back on me, right?
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.220]   Like, wow, I'm much more aware
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.900]   of how I'm coming across to that person
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.440]   'cause they disagree with me about something
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.540]   or they're not someone I would normally fraternize with.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.980]   And it's just bred more self-awareness in me.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.260]   And so I would encourage people
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:15.500]   to actually seek out connections in uncomfortable spaces
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.720]   because that will allow you to fill in
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:18.580]   at least some of the gaps.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.680]   Now, some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.140]   because of life experiences.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.220]   So I'm thinking in my own life.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.220]   So I thought I grieved in a very particular kind of way.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:32.660]   And then during COVID, my husband and I experienced
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.500]   multiple pregnancy losses with our surrogate.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.300]   And I found myself grieving
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.580]   in a way that was completely foreign to me.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.700]   I don't think talking to anyone would have revealed to me
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.620]   that I was gonna grieve in this way
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.300]   where usually I would reach out to people
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.340]   and I would wanna stay connected
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.660]   and I became so shut off and closed off
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.060]   and I didn't wanna talk to anyone.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.400]   For days after the losses, I was so disoriented.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.340]   There I learned, oh, actually you can respond
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.180]   in a diverse set of ways to grief, right?
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.200]   Like you don't have a singular experience with grief,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.300]   but I might've only learned that
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:05.320]   from the actual experience of confronting it.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.500]   That said, I do think there's a lot of value
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.640]   in trying to fill in gaps in knowledge or self-awareness
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.800]   through these more quotidian conversations
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.600]   you have with people.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.120]   - I love, love, love what you said about
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.960]   deliberately placing oneself into environments
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.600]   where we receive critical feedback from people
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.980]   that we view as quite disparate from us,
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.300]   at least in terms of our experience of them.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:34.360]   It was the great Karl Deisseroth,
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.920]   another incredibly accomplished neuroscientist,
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:41.160]   happens to be a colleague of mine at Stanford,
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.220]   who, he's a psychiatrist, and he said,
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.440]   we think we know how other people feel,
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.800]   but we really have no idea how other people feel
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.920]   unless we ask them.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.760]   In fact, most of the time,
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.480]   we don't even really know how we feel.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.560]   We're not very good at gauging our own emotions.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.720]   So credit to Karl for making that statement.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.120]   But with that said,
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.780]   I think getting a sense of how other people see us
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.720]   and disagreement in particular
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   can be incredibly informative.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.080]   - I just want to say one other point on this,
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.900]   which is I think getting feedback from others
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.960]   almost gets a bad rap these days in society.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.200]   'Cause it's like, you should only care
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.280]   about who you are inside, who you know yourself to be.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.320]   And I'm like, dude, we are social creatures.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.560]   It absolutely matters how I come off to others.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.920]   I mean, I think that should be a huge part
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.280]   of my self-identity, should be how I impact others.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.400]   And I think we should be shameless
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.960]   about integrating that into our understanding of self.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.840]   If I feel like I'm an excellent person inside
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.660]   and I'm regularly wounding the people around me,
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:41.820]   that matters, that's relevant to how I see myself.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.380]   And so I do worry sometimes with the current
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.980]   cultural climate that we're pushing ourselves
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.700]   so much towards the space of like,
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.680]   all that matters is authenticity and being yourself.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.740]   I mean, first of all, sometimes yourself isn't awesome.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.020]   You might want to actually optimize
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.740]   or like change some things about yourself to be better.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.740]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.660]   And then second, it's okay to care what other people think.
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.220]   Usually they're great barometers
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.740]   of things that you might not be aware of
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.940]   in terms of the impact you're having.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.420]   So I just want to like be a lobbyist
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.220]   for caring what other people think, just for a moment.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.300]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.660]   This is one of the reasons why I say
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:14.780]   at the end of every episode
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:17.700]   that I do read all the comments on YouTube.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:21.580]   I think I was raised in an academic culture
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.700]   where feedback on lectures, student feedback was critical.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.020]   I mean, it is important, I believe,
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:32.020]   to be a selective filter because when in the old days,
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.900]   we'll say there was an opportunity to map the statements
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.460]   to the grade that the student received,
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:37.880]   you can no longer do this.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.980]   So you would often see that some of the worst,
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.740]   you know, some of the worst feedback
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.460]   was I hated, it was unclear, exactly.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.060]   And then you'd look at their grade and you'd say,
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:49.160]   well, okay, this helps explain.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.180]   And yet it was also important to understand
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:55.740]   where that could have represented some failings on my part.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.260]   And a classroom is but one environment.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.860]   I think the online environment is where this gets tricky
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:05.140]   because of the way that we all differ
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.220]   in our capacity to receive critical feedback.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:11.820]   And sometimes the harshness of one form of feedback
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.580]   sends people, you know, feeling, you know,
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.700]   back on their heels or feeling, you know,
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.660]   even ego or emotionally injured
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.140]   in ways that they actually feel is traumatic.
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.580]   And I think that's part of the problem
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:28.580]   is that we don't really have a way to gauge.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.420]   I mean, we know inappropriate when we see it.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.860]   We know appropriate when we see it,
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.140]   but all the stuff in between,
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.900]   'cause it's on a continuum really,
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.060]   is where it gets tricky.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.120]   I certainly think integrating the possibility
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.720]   that somebody might be right,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:46.360]   what is it that they say in certain forms
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.240]   of personal developments?
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.560]   Like, you know, if somebody is coming at you
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.000]   with an argument about you,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.620]   the best state of mind you could have is you might be right
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.380]   because that lets you hold your ground a bit.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.540]   It still maintains a boundary,
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:57.820]   but you're not saying you're right
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.360]   and you're not saying you're wrong.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.000]   You're sort of on, you're in a kind of a flat-footed stance
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.420]   where you could move either way.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.360]   And I like that, this idea of,
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.320]   well, they might be right.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.700]   And then you can say, no, or yes.
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:11.460]   But in any case, I just want to throw out both hands
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:16.460]   and as many votes as I can as one individual to say,
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.240]   yes, I totally agree.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   More direct feedback and disagreement is great.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.100]   It's wonderful.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.020]   And I think in science,
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.860]   you're used to people saying harsh things about your work
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:30.760]   until they eventually say,
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.540]   okay, you can publish the paper.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.020]   I grew up in the culture of skateboarding
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.580]   where like nothing's good enough
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:38.380]   and then occasionally something's good.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.340]   And in the landscape of podcasting,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:45.220]   I think the comment section is a great way to get feedback.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.140]   And that's why I continue to encourage feedback.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.100]   It sounds like you do as well.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.900]   - Yeah, I think, I try to just every endeavor that I pursue,
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.980]   I try to approach with a lot of humility.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.280]   And I think if I were to describe at work, right,
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.360]   I lead this team.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.620]   And I think if you were to ask people
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:03.060]   what my defining trait is as a leader,
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.940]   it's actually not like strong convictions.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:08.540]   It's actually a willingness to update her opinions
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.140]   on things, her belief systems,
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.140]   her strategy based on incoming information.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.040]   I really, really pride myself
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.460]   on having a flexible mindset about stuff
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.820]   and not being stubborn.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.700]   This is true in my marriage, right?
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.700]   Like my husband, Jimmy and I really pride ourselves
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:26.540]   in like saying, you know what,
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.180]   based on what you just shared, I'm changing my mind.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.340]   Like you're right and I'm wrong, right?
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:33.300]   And if you can actually start to value that,
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:36.740]   if you could start to see that as a virtuous quality,
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:39.580]   I think historically, right, when we think about leadership,
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.500]   we've thought about people who are incredibly resolute
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:43.340]   in their convictions,
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.700]   but that doesn't allow the space to,
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.340]   again, beige an update, you know?
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.940]   Update your mindset when you get new information
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.920]   or you realize that you erred in some way
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.240]   in terms of the logic that you used or what have you.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.660]   And I've been extremely intentional
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.260]   in every sphere that I've worked in
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.540]   to have this very open mind
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.600]   and to be very open to critical feedback.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.720]   It does not mean that I take every piece of feedback, okay?
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.580]   Obviously, I have some criteria I use to decide
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.460]   whether it's meaningful feedback
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.700]   or it's not meaningful feedback, right?
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:20.700]   But the locus of my pride is not in being right
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.260]   or having a strong conviction.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.600]   It is actually in my willingness
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.660]   to have a more dynamic state of mind
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.060]   regarding lots of issues.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.860]   Maybe that's just what it means to be a scientist, right?
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.780]   Like you have to be willing to update
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.380]   in the face of new information.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.420]   - I am nodding for those that are listening.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.860]   I'm just nodding and thinking yes, yes, and more yes,
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.360]   because I think that we all need more of that as individuals
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.100]   and if we can't get it from our work setting
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.060]   or group setting,
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:52.500]   sometimes asking a friend can be extremely useful.
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.060]   I have a friend, he happens to be a professor
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.460]   at a university back East.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:59.900]   I won't embarrass him by disclosing where he's at,
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:02.380]   but I recall as a junior faculty member,
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.220]   because he knows me well,
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:06.160]   he's a few years behind me in our career trajectories,
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.460]   but asking him for an honest assessment,
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.660]   I asked for the most brutally honest assessment,
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:13.460]   me that he could give and some of it stung.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.500]   Some of it stung.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.240]   He was relating some ways in which I show up as a friend
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.440]   and I'm super present and I have this tendency,
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.280]   I'm pretty introverted,
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.280]   I'll disappear for long periods of time.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.520]   In college, they call me Dart
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.740]   'cause I'd show up at parties, I'd be there
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.020]   and then I would disappear for like two weeks
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.200]   and just be in my books,
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.980]   say hi to people and just keep going,
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.940]   sort of in and out of connection.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:33.540]   I've worked hard to change that over the years.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.280]   I think I have, but who knows.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.820]   In any event, a friend who knows us well,
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.660]   that you insist on, don't give me any compliments,
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.380]   just give me the harsh stuff, that can be very useful.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.780]   - And that reminds me of some research by Ethan Cross.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:52.880]   So he looks at how we can tame our mental chatter.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:56.300]   And if you don't have the friend available to you,
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.660]   there is a really easy distancing technique
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.900]   that you can use when you're in the throes of a problem
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:04.500]   where you are trying to actively reframe something
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.500]   or maybe see where your blind spots are.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:09.060]   And that's by thinking about your problem
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.600]   from a third person perspective
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.220]   versus a first person perspective.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.800]   So you play the role of someone who's giving advice
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.780]   to a friend in your head, but that friend is actually you.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:21.620]   And it actually promotes some degree of objectivity
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.500]   and like emotional distance from that,
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.020]   again, that fuzzy hazy set of feelings
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.220]   that you have around the emotion, right?
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.920]   You're trying to like get rid of that piece
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.300]   so that you can bring a slightly more sober
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.380]   recommendation to the situation.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:36.620]   So that can be really helpful.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:39.460]   And then the other thing to do is,
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:42.100]   I think when we're facing challenges,
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:43.620]   when we're going through a hard time,
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.380]   we do have an instinct to want to vent, right?
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.360]   And again, in this era of vulnerability and whatnot,
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.340]   we're told like, yes, share everything that's on your mind.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:53.260]   It can actually be counterproductive to vent.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.780]   And the reason for that is that when you're venting
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.500]   about a hard situation that you're going through
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.820]   or something that you're frustrated about with yourself,
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:04.780]   typically the person you've invited into the conversation,
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.580]   they're a nice empathetic person.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.180]   They want to make you feel better.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.140]   And so what do they do?
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.180]   They offer emotional balm in the situation.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.980]   They're like, oh my God, that does sound terrible.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.180]   You were so wronged.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.400]   I'm so sorry you went through that.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.240]   Instead of playing the role of what Ethan calls
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.840]   like a cognitive advisor,
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.100]   which is actively trying to challenge
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:26.540]   the narrative you're telling about your situation,
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:29.840]   actively trying to get you to question
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.140]   whether the way you're portraying the situation is accurate
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:34.500]   and actually trying to get you to reframe
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.780]   aspects of the situation.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.300]   And so when we think about venting,
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.140]   when it comes to again,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.020]   filling in those blind spots about ourselves,
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.620]   you might want to tell your friend at the outset,
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:47.080]   like you even said, lay off the nice stuff.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.180]   I just want to hear the hard stuff.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.240]   You want to tell your friend at the beginning,
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.020]   look, I'm having this challenge with my colleague at work
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.920]   where the guy at the gym is giving me a really tough time.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.140]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.780]   I'm going to have, here's the situation.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.100]   Rather than trying to make me feel better
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:02.580]   about the situation,
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.220]   I want you to actively find holes, poke holes
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.820]   in the way that I'm thinking about this thing
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:11.180]   so that I can try and find some reframing strategies
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.360]   to see the situation from a different vantage point.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.180]   So these are all called distancing techniques, right?
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.020]   Third person versus first person.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.500]   And actually there's some really interesting
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.940]   neuroscience research showing that
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.280]   when we view our problems and ourselves
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.320]   from a third person perspective,
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.680]   neural activity in areas associated with hostility
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.780]   and aggression actually decrease.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.340]   And so that can be really helpful when it comes to,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.960]   resolving interpersonal conflict
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.320]   or trying to see where you might have been wrong.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.280]   - I love these examples because especially the one where
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.460]   one does it on their own,
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.320]   that truly doesn't require anything except to-
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.260]   - You can be the introverted Andrew, still do this.
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.580]   You don't even have to go to the party
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:47.700]   and then ghost everyone.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.820]   - Yeah, well, I don't, yeah, back then it would have been,
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:52.340]   there were no cell phones or smartphones rather,
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.860]   but yeah, it was a bit of ghosting.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:58.220]   It was just, I can reset with small numbers of people
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.580]   that I'm close to, but I found at that time
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:05.580]   a need to go into an isolated space
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.260]   to do what I need to do to reset myself.
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.180]   But I realized there are certain forms of communication
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.460]   that are still required.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.240]   Like I'm alive, I still get this.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.900]   I still get this from my mother every once in a while.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:18.140]   So like, if you don't reach out,
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.220]   and not only do I not know what's happening with you,
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.660]   but I also don't know if you're okay.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.660]   And I'm thinking I'm a grown man, of course, I'm fine.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:26.540]   And then I, of course, use the worst possible response
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.000]   that any son or child could give,
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.640]   which is listen, if something happened to me,
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.780]   like someone, like the police would contact you
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.340]   or the hospital would contact you, which is not reassuring.
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.100]   So kids everywhere, call your parents.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.100]   - Your poor mother, Andrew.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:39.140]   - I know, I know.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.380]   - Just call her a bit more, come on.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.460]   - Still working on it.
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.580]   - It is a work in progress, venting.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:50.100]   I'm so glad that you brought this up.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:54.080]   I think that there are these buzzwords now, authenticity.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.220]   I do think that there are certain forms of communication
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.420]   that can be injurious to people.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.220]   And yet I think having some internal buffers
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:09.500]   to all that incoming stuff, I mean, it is important.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.720]   I mean, you can't be online.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.740]   And I think everyone is pretty much online these days
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:16.580]   without having some policies for oneself
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.100]   and how you're gonna deal with this stuff.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.780]   How am I gonna be a selective filter?
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:21.500]   I think knowing the ends of the continuum,
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.500]   like this is clearly benevolent kind discourse.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.740]   This is clearly bad.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.140]   I'm gonna block this or get rid of it.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.300]   But then within that middle range,
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.440]   having some rules and policies for how to filter it,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.780]   either by time of day that you look at it or getting input,
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.220]   but considering the, it might be true,
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.860]   it might not be true, what people are saying.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.620]   - And like you said, you were talking about memory
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:50.780]   and how we tend to overweight negative experiences.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:55.060]   And I did find myself, so I gave this speech
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.320]   and it was posted and I was looking at the comments
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.060]   and I literally, any time I brain coded a comment as positive
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.700]   I just skipped right past it.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.300]   I was literally just searching for the negative stuff.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.920]   - As if the positive is generic
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.180]   and the negative is somehow genuine.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.980]   - Yes, and I had to make it a mental,
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:12.860]   I had to make a mental note.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:17.620]   Hey, it's okay to marinate in the messages that are saying
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.500]   that this really helped them in some way.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.660]   And they really enjoyed the thing.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:24.100]   And again, for self-critical people,
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:26.540]   I think it takes an extra step to remind yourself
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.300]   to also read the good stuff
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.780]   and to allow that stuff to count too.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.460]   - Well, we did an episode on gratitude
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.940]   and one of the big surprises that came to me
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:39.900]   in researching for that episode was that the best evidence
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.720]   for gratitude having positive effects on neural circuitry,
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.940]   neurochemistry comes from when we receive gratitude
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.220]   as opposed to give gratitude.
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.580]   This is what's often lost in the discussion about gratitude.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.060]   So all the more incentive to give gratitude
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.900]   and to be aware of when it's coming your way
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.620]   and internalize it.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.100]   There is a small category of people out there I think,
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:04.100]   hopefully small, that so bask in positive feedback
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.060]   that it amplifies their narcissism,
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.980]   but it's clear that you are not one of those people.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:12.140]   So zero minus one risk of that happening.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:16.520]   I wanna talk a little bit about goals
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.100]   as it relates to motivation.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:23.100]   Because you've done a lot of important work
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.920]   and what I consider is organization of this,
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.620]   what would otherwise be a pretty complex space.
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.460]   What is more important to most people
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.980]   than being motivated and focused and excited
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:37.300]   hopefully on endeavors that they enjoy
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.980]   and that inspire delight.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.980]   But tell us about what can not just initiate,
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:46.580]   but what can sustain motivation.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.260]   Because we've talked about the dopamine system
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.300]   on this podcast many times before,
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.500]   but that's a pretty reductionist way to look at it.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.260]   And you have a different perspective
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:57.420]   that I've really benefited from learning a bit about.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:59.340]   - Yeah, so when it comes to goals,
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.000]   I mean, it's first important to recognize
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.380]   that there's two parts of a goal, okay?
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:05.740]   So there's the way that we define the goal
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.380]   and then there's the way that we pursue the goal.
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.060]   And I think we tend to overlook the first category,
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.380]   how we define the goal,
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.980]   because oftentimes our goals seem
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.560]   like they should be so obvious to us, right?
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.820]   I wanna lose weight.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.580]   I wanna avoid sleeping late
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.020]   so that I get a good night's sleep.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.380]   I wanna build muscle mass, right?
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:24.660]   Like these are things that just seem
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.020]   like they should just be intuitive, right?
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.180]   But what research and behavioral science shows
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.980]   is that not all goal frames are made equal.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.780]   In fact, really small tweaks to the way
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:38.740]   that we frame our goals can have an outsized impact
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.420]   on whether or not we're successful at reaching that goal.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:45.260]   So one such framing is whether you frame your goals
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:49.000]   in terms of an approach orientation
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.660]   or an avoidance orientation.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.700]   So let me talk about what this means.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:54.920]   So an approach orientation would be,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.180]   I want to eat healthier foods, right?
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:00.300]   Avoidance would be, I want to avoid unhealthy foods.
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:03.220]   Okay, so in the context of say your social life,
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.040]   approach would be, I want to be in a relationship.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.860]   I wanna enter a relationship.
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:11.080]   Avoidance would be, I want to avoid feeling loneliness.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.660]   Okay, I wanna avoid feeling isolated.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.660]   Now, the reason why these two frames
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:20.780]   are important to consider is that they can have
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.100]   a different impact on our motivational states.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.660]   And they can also have a different impact
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:30.380]   on the emotional response that we have to success
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.240]   and failure in these domains.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.540]   So what we tend to find is that when you frame something
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:40.180]   in an approach orientation way, when you succeed,
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:42.100]   that success is met with feelings
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:43.900]   of pride and accomplishment.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:46.380]   We find that it leads to a boost in motivation,
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:50.240]   boost endurance, it boosts perseverance, okay?
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.660]   When you frame something in terms of avoidance,
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.320]   success is met with feelings of calm and relief.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.540]   So kind of like a, ooh, wipe the forehead,
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:01.220]   like thank goodness I avoided that calamitous outcome
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.700]   or thank goodness I avoided doing that really bad thing.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:04.580]   - Back to neutral.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:05.820]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:10.700]   And so it is fine to frame goals in terms of avoidance.
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.780]   And actually sometimes it's just personality dependent.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.380]   Like some people are more driven by fear
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:17.700]   or they need a lot more urgency to drive them.
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:22.460]   But it is important to know that the approach orientation
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.380]   is on average more motivating.
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.720]   And so you might want to think of reframing your goal
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.820]   in terms of approach versus avoidance.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:31.480]   The other advantage to approach is that
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.100]   when you frame something as avoidance, right,
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.040]   I want to avoid doing X, I want to avoid doing Y,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.540]   it's really hard to measure success, right?
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:41.860]   It's like, are you really tracking every time
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.700]   you're tempted by the chocolate chip cookie
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.460]   and you don't actually eat it?
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.060]   That's really hard to measure, right?
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:49.960]   And we do better when we can measure success and failure,
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:50.800]   right?
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.500]   So it's easier to track the number of times
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.000]   you approach a salad, right?
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.480]   You approach something that's healthy.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.840]   And so anyway, so it's really interesting to see
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.300]   how they get in this really subtle shift.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:05.180]   And we see this across the board in behavioral science
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:07.380]   can have such a big impact on behavior.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:09.920]   And on this framing thing, I'll just share
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.420]   one little anecdote from my time working in government.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.860]   So we were trying to motivate veterans to sign up
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:19.720]   for a employment and educational assistance program.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.640]   So this is after their years of service.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.340]   And this is a really important benefit
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.840]   that the government offers for free because the transition
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.540]   from military to civilian life can
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:32.380]   be very fraught with a lot of psychological and physical
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:33.500]   obstacles.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.020]   And so I remember the Department of Veterans Affairs,
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:39.420]   they had almost no money to fund a marketing program
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:39.940]   around this.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:43.020]   They said, Maya and team, we've got one email
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.740]   that we're going to send to vets and have at it,
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.620]   but that's all we're working with.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:51.800]   And my teammates and I ended up changing just one word
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.320]   in this email message.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.440]   Instead of telling vets that they were eligible
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.720]   for the program, we simply reminded them
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.000]   that they had earned it through their years of service.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.780]   And that one word change led to a 9% increase in access
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:05.440]   to the benefit.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.920]   And it's based in a psychological principle
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.300]   called the endowment effect, which
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.960]   says that we value things more when we own them
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:14.920]   or in this case have earned them.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.300]   And so I shared this example only
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.440]   to say that is such a small change, right?
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.260]   But we just know that, again, these small little tweaks
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.800]   in the way that we talk to ourselves,
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.480]   the way that we frame our goals can have a really big impact
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:27.880]   on our behavior.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.120]   I'm fascinated by that result. Some people hearing it
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.840]   might think, OK, 9%, is that really that great?
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.960]   But we're talking about a one word change.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.780]   And the scale of the federal government, right?
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:41.640]   So 9%.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:47.540]   Big organizations, hard to argue that things change quickly
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:48.620]   in big organizations.
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.140]   A discussion for another time.
[01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:54.660]   But eligible versus earned, I mean, again,
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:56.900]   I come back to this possibility that there's something
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:02.580]   about words like earned that invoke a verb state within us
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:06.620]   that makes us more action oriented,
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:10.340]   similar to being able to see ourselves in some landscape
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:13.180]   that can evoke delight or awe, as opposed
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:19.120]   to just seeing the landscape that evokes delight or awe.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.960]   Yeah, I'm really hung up on this because I
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.800]   think one of the major challenges,
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:28.820]   it seems, for behavioral change is that most people do wait
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.880]   for the stick as opposed to feeling into the carrot,
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.420]   so to speak.
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:35.860]   I mean, all you have to do is look
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.120]   at the enormous number of people who
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:42.620]   are struggling with health related issues for which there's
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:43.900]   now a lot of active debate.
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.340]   Is it genetically determined or et cetera?
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.680]   And setting all that aside, it's just very clear
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:51.460]   that there are a number of behavioral things--
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:55.440]   sunlight, sleep, exercise, social connection, nutrition
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.520]   among them--
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.940]   that there's no pill for, there's no injection for,
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.260]   there's absolutely no replacement for.
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:06.660]   So getting people to change their behavior is hard.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:10.280]   Telling people that they're capable sometimes helps,
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.560]   but doesn't seem sufficient.
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.340]   So what are some more of these verb states
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:20.360]   that people you think can internalize that give them
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:23.420]   access to the real sense of possibility
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:25.500]   and get them changing their behavior?
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:28.060]   Yeah, and behavior change is very hard.
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.340]   I sometimes bristle at some of the hacks
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.940]   that I see online because I'm like,
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.620]   I don't think there's a lot of evidence that supports
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.280]   that this works.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.380]   So what I'm sharing today is actually backed by really
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:39.700]   high quality research.
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:44.020]   One of my friends and mentors, Ayelet Fishbach,
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:46.260]   has done a lot of this work at the University of Chicago
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.460]   on goal setting and motivation.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:50.340]   A couple other things for people to consider.
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:51.700]   And by the way, I love this space
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:53.040]   because I'm obsessed with goals.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.420]   So I love getting better at things
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:57.220]   and I'm using all of these insights in my own life.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.960]   So it is truly a delight to get to share them.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.380]   OK, sidebar.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:02.900]   Important sidebar, I would argue,
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.460]   because you live this stuff.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.120]   You don't just research it, you live it.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.280]   Yes, it's totally me search or whatever they call it.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.680]   So who sets the goal matters?
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:18.140]   So a lot of us work with coaches, trainers, mentors,
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:19.180]   bosses.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.160]   That's great.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.220]   It's really, really helpful for people in our lives
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.820]   to bring structure to our goals, to push us along,
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:27.280]   to motivate us.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.900]   But when other people are setting our goals,
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.580]   setting our targets for us, it undermines
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.060]   a really valuable source of motivation, which
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.380]   is being in the driver's seat.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.860]   We love steering in our lives.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.420]   We love feeling agency.
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.320]   We love recruiting our own agency
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.180]   when it comes to achieving our goals.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:48.980]   And so we talked about how people
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:52.720]   will go to irrational lengths to avoid feeling uncertainty.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.300]   People also go to irrational lengths
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.420]   to preserve their agency and control over a situation.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.220]   So there's some really interesting research
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:01.620]   that's come out just in the last few years showing
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:07.620]   that humans prefer to use their judgment over an algorithm
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:10.540]   that they know performs better than their judgment
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.500]   but did not involve them.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.540]   And they're much more satisfied with the outcomes
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.920]   when it's them that's in the driver's seat.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:20.740]   And so what this means, I think, in everyday context
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:23.200]   is not to do away with trainers and coaches and whatnot.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.740]   Every trainer and coach is listening.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.380]   Don't hate me.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.460]   OK, you're sticking around.
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:31.280]   But what they can do is they can build something
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.260]   of a choice set into your day-to-day programming, right?
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:38.000]   So let's say that at work you have a certain skill
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.160]   that you're trying to build.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.100]   Ask for a set of options to choose from.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.440]   Own the targets more.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.020]   You will see a boost in motivation.
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.800]   Let's say you're working out with a trainer.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.140]   They're like, it's leg day.
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:49.280]   OK, I'm going to own some of my targets, right?
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.740]   Are we going to go hard on deadlifts?
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:53.100]   Are we going to go hard on squats, whatever it is?
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.980]   And so build some agency into the experience
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:59.540]   because nothing supplants that kind of intrinsic drive
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:05.200]   and the feeling that you own the success or the failure.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.900]   Again, I think to your earlier point,
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.480]   what we're really trying to do with some
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.760]   of these behavioral insights is capitalize
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:14.180]   on our natural state as humans, right?
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:15.200]   Like, what drives us?
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.660]   And it turns out we really love being in control.
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:19.540]   Well, why don't we monopolize on that
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.400]   when it comes to our goal pursuit, right?
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.740]   So we're trying to figure out those areas of psychology
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:25.960]   that we can leverage.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.840]   That's fantastic.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.940]   The word agency is so key here.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:33.460]   I think it explains that earlier result, the shock experiment.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:39.300]   People having agency over their response to 100% of the time,
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.560]   at least it's giving them some sense of control
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.740]   and mitigating it.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:47.060]   Whereas when it's random 50-50, or rather,
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:48.860]   when it's random 50% of the trials,
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.220]   then even though the outcome is better on the whole,
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:57.700]   it's perceived somehow as a reduction in agency.
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.580]   There's something fundamental there for sure.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:00.900]   When I started my laboratory
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.880]   and there was an additional pressure to publish papers,
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.720]   this is before getting tenure, I used to ask students
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.340]   in postdocs when the paperwork would be ready.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:14.380]   And then finally, I stopped asking and just said,
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:17.100]   "Why don't you tell me when the deadline is?"
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.020]   Awesome, yes.
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:21.440]   And not a single one failed, or rather, I should put it
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:24.480]   in the positive light, every single time they succeeded
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.820]   in beating their estimate because they were
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.520]   in control of that endpoint.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:36.080]   So it was, at times, challenging for me, but they set a date.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.420]   And also, by the way, if they need to extend
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.960]   that date outward, we did.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.240]   That was their choice.
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:42.620]   They said they needed more time.
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:45.320]   The rule in science that I think applies a lot of places is,
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:48.620]   I always like the phrase, "As fast as I carefully can,"
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.760]   because you don't want to rush, right?
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:54.060]   But that sense of agency, I like to think translated
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.880]   to more joy for them.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.860]   And certainly, there was a lot of productivity from them.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:02.560]   And they might be listening to this, and so they can put
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:05.740]   in the comments whether or not I'm telling the truth here.
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:07.280]   Most of them are professors now, so that's good.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.780]   - Well, that probably means they succeeded.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.780]   - Oh, they definitely succeeded.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.680]   The question is whether or not I had anything to do with it.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.060]   My advisors always said, "The best thing you could do is
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.420]   support your students in postdocs
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.140]   and then just get out of their way."
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:20.220]   Because the really good ones are, you can't control them.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.820]   You're just trying to not screw things up for them.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:26.380]   No, there's a lot of intrinsic motivation there.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:30.700]   - Curious about the difference between lone pursuits
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:33.100]   and group pursuits, because I know you understand a lot
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.700]   about groups, and I want to make sure that we talk
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:37.980]   about groupthink, although that has
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.660]   such a negative connotation.
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.660]   But the way that we tend to kind of revert to the mean
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.700]   when it comes to our thinking and our opinions,
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.300]   and certainly our explanations of who's right
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.020]   and who's wrong when we are in a collection
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.260]   of like-minded people.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:54.100]   - Yeah.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.860]   - This could also be, you know, phrased as,
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.520]   "What are the dangers of being among like-minded people?"
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.660]   (laughing)
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.780]   And then we'll relate that back to motivation.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:05.140]   But what are the dangers of being among like-minded people?
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:09.240]   - Yeah, I mean, well, in the context of goals
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:12.240]   and motivation, it can be very, very helpful to be
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.700]   in the context of like-minded people.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:17.180]   And the reason for that is we often don't see failure
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:19.660]   up close when it comes to people pursuing their goals.
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:21.660]   But if we are in the presence of people whose values
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:24.540]   we share, who have a similar commitment to doing something,
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:27.440]   and we see up close that they sometimes have those days
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.980]   where they fail or we have the vulnerability to show
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:32.580]   when we failed, that can actually increase our resolve
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.260]   that the goals that we're trying to achieve
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.980]   are actually possible, okay?
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:39.180]   I think the danger of being in the like-minded spaces
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:41.780]   is around how it limits your frame of mind, right?
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:44.240]   So when it comes to the ideas that you have,
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.740]   when it comes to the convictions you have
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:49.500]   around your points of view, it can be very dangerous
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.900]   to only be in the echo chamber.
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.540]   And again, 'cause I wanna give people strategies
[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:56.700]   to challenge their way of thinking without them having
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.340]   to socialize for all the introverts out there.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.180]   I have a lot of compassion.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.740]   I have introverted tendencies, so I get it.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:04.740]   One helpful thought experiment you can use
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:06.360]   when you feel like maybe you're spending a little bit
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:09.260]   too much time around people who are just reinforcing
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:11.980]   whatever viewpoints you have is to ask
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:15.340]   how your belief system and your ideas
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:18.100]   and your opinions of things might have been different
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.660]   had you been born during a different time period
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:25.040]   and in a different family or cultural landscape.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.220]   And what happens when it comes to our viewpoints
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:29.800]   is that they become so tethered to our identities
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.100]   that we feel like if we were to jettison
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:35.820]   a certain belief or value, we would be jettisoning ourselves
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.520]   and that feels way too threatening.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:40.340]   It's way too destabilizing to engage in that.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.300]   But the minute you imagine what it would have been like
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.200]   to have been born in a different family
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.940]   with a different religious belief system,
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.700]   with a different value system,
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:50.460]   all of a sudden you transport your same self, right,
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:53.260]   I'm still Maya, into this new environment
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:56.260]   and you start to see how non-precious
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:57.620]   some of your beliefs are, right?
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.860]   Maybe they don't have the sacred quality
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.140]   that you thought that they did.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.960]   And so you might be more open to changing your mind,
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:06.060]   more open and receptive to challenging
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.020]   your own points of view if you engage
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.820]   in that thought experiment.
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.900]   - I recall you discussing a description
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:17.180]   of people watching a game of sport
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:19.340]   that involved bad calls.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.780]   - Yeah, yeah, controversial referee calls.
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.620]   - Controversial referee calls.
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:23.980]   Yeah, if you could share with us a little bit
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.820]   about that result, 'cause I find it really interesting,
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:28.820]   especially the part where the experimenters
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:32.660]   can swap the identities of the teams in theory
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:36.140]   and then, well, basically what people come to realize
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.700]   is that our perception of the outside world
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:43.620]   is strongly informed by the group that we see ourselves in
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.140]   and often to our own detriment.
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:48.740]   - Absolutely, yeah, so this is a study from the 1950s
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.180]   and to your point, you know, we tend to think,
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:53.260]   okay, we're human beings, we're really enlightened,
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:56.260]   we're making decisions and we're engaging
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:00.180]   in judgments of things based on data and evidence and facts
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:03.260]   and, you know, surely my visual system wouldn't lie to me,
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:05.500]   so whatever I perceive is gonna be true
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.740]   and vertical, vertical representation of the world
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.400]   and like, not true, okay?
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:14.620]   A lot of our beliefs, and these are strong beliefs,
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:16.800]   I mean, again, they're what we believe to be fact
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:19.460]   about the world is informed by our group membership.
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:24.460]   So in this study, loyal fans of two opposing football teams
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.180]   watched these controversial plays, right?
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.960]   So where the referee made a call
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.260]   and they weren't quite certain
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:33.260]   if it was like in or out, let's say.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:37.220]   And depending on your loyalty to the team,
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:40.020]   to whatever sports team, right, whichever side you were on,
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.460]   you were much more likely to favor calls
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:46.940]   that were made in your team's favor.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.860]   And, you know, when you ask people
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:49.980]   coming out of a study like this,
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.860]   it's not like, yup, I knew I was biased.
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:55.700]   Like, I knew that I was basing my judgment
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.220]   of these referee calls based on my affiliation
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.180]   and my love of team X or team Y.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.000]   You wouldn't think that.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.460]   You think you were an arbiter of truth in this situation.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:06.660]   You're just recalling what your visual system saw.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:10.060]   And I think that shows how powerful
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.620]   these social forces are, how powerful
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:13.720]   our group affiliations are,
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.900]   because it can truly change the way that you see stuff, right?
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:19.460]   Of course it can then transform the way
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.040]   that you think about stuff.
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.900]   And so that to me is a powerful reminder
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.700]   that when we are in disagreement with someone else
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.980]   and we just try to bombard them with facts, right?
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:31.420]   I mean, you're a scientist, right?
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.720]   So if you're hearing someone say something
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.320]   and you're like, oh, that's not accurate, that's not true,
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.860]   your instinct probably is to say,
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:40.340]   have you heard about the 2017 study,
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:42.340]   the peer-reviewed journal article from PubMed,
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:44.080]   that da-da-da, right?
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.360]   But when you recognize that actually a large part
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:50.220]   of our belief system emerges from the groups
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:51.420]   that we identify with,
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:54.720]   I think there's an inspiring lesson that comes from this.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.340]   So we shouldn't be too disheartened by the fact
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.820]   that this is true, but it helps round out our understanding
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:02.660]   of why it is that people believe the things they do.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.480]   And as a result, we have more resources at hand
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.180]   to try to understand how we can change their minds, right?
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:11.820]   So one of the guys that I interviewed on my podcast,
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:14.820]   his name is Daryl Davis, he's a black jazz musician,
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:18.420]   and he was confronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klan
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:19.840]   at one of his performances.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.780]   And it led, talk about a slight change of plans.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.200]   I mean, he just went on a totally different life path
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:28.040]   and ended up convincing dozens of people
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.780]   to leave white supremacy groups,
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:31.740]   including the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:36.740]   And when it comes to Daryl and his approach,
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:38.680]   well, one, he recruited people's agencies.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.420]   So he never implied to them,
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:42.880]   "Oh, I'm trying to change your mind."
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.800]   He inspired, he always says like,
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.080]   "I didn't convince them, Maya.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.220]   "They convinced themselves to change their minds."
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.520]   So he recruited their agency.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.900]   But he also tried his absolute hardest
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:57.480]   to not question their fundamental and underlying humanity,
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.280]   right, so he tried to understand,
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.480]   like, why are you part of this group?
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.920]   This vile, vitriolic group?
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:05.140]   And some people would share,
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.980]   "Well, you know, it's a family tradition thing.
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:10.000]   "My father was in the Klan, my grandfather's in the Klan."
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.880]   Look, none of this excuses being in a hate group, okay?
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.980]   But it at least gave Daryl an understanding
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:18.380]   of some of the factors that were pushing them
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.500]   towards the group so that he might offer
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:23.280]   that sense of community, that sense of belonging
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:26.260]   somewhere else, maybe outside of a hate group, right?
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:28.320]   But if he thought that he was actually just fighting
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:31.840]   over facts, over whether African Americans
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:34.600]   should be treated equal to everyone else,
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.480]   then he would have lost that argument
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.840]   because he wasn't even fighting with the right currency,
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.760]   right, what was relevant.
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:44.160]   So what was so, I mean, this is my,
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:45.880]   it was the first episode of A Slight Change of Plans
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:48.200]   we ever released and continues to be my favorite
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.000]   because what was so thrilling about this interview
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.840]   is that the strategies Daryl used
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.320]   to convince people to change their minds,
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:58.540]   again, of these deeply entrenched, horrific views,
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.480]   were totally corroborated by the science
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.760]   of how we change people's minds.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:04.400]   So he used a lot of really effective strategies,
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.840]   just intuitively, like he's just a mastermind
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:10.160]   behavioral scientist just by virtue of who he is,
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:13.180]   but he showed genuine curiosity
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.860]   for why it is they believe what they did,
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:16.480]   which is, again, extremely hard,
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:17.760]   I would not have had the equanimity
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:19.820]   to show genuine curiosity for why someone
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:22.760]   is in the Ku Klux Klan, but he showed that curiosity,
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:26.560]   he increased his question to statement ratio,
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.400]   so it's really important to ask people a lot of questions,
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.400]   and then he would ask people a really important question,
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.520]   which is, well, what in theory could change your mind?
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:39.340]   Like, what evidence would I have to give you
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:42.280]   in order to change your mind about X, Y, or Z?
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.740]   And the reason that I love asking that question
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:49.020]   is that it presupposes that someone ought to be willing
[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.440]   to change their mind in the face of new information.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.800]   So this harkens back to the conversation
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.160]   we were having earlier about the importance
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.400]   of having a malleable state of mind
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.800]   and being willing to update in the face of new info.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.580]   Now, if the person in response says,
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:02.400]   literally, nothing will change my mind,
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.920]   okay, well then you know it's not worth your time
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.600]   to have the disagreement with them,
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.100]   but if they give you a little bit and say,
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:10.300]   well, maybe I would change my mind on vaccines
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:11.720]   if you were to tell me X, Y, or Z,
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:15.300]   maybe I would change my mind on immigration reform
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.360]   if you were to tell me this or that,
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:19.400]   now you have an in, right?
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.440]   But you do need to get them into the state of mind
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.880]   where they think, yeah, I guess in theory,
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:25.360]   I could change my mind about this thing
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:28.000]   that I feel absolutely resolute about.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.320]   - I've never worked in public policy,
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.320]   but I feel very strongly that where I see failures
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:41.520]   and mass of public health policy or educational policy,
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:46.920]   almost always there seems to be a failure
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:50.040]   of even interest in understanding what motivates
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.440]   the other side's position.
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.720]   And this is where I just,
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:56.120]   this actually gets me frustrated to the point of motivated
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:59.760]   where it's like people are saying, you're wrong,
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.980]   you're wrong, know this, know that,
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:04.400]   to the point of it's almost maddening
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:09.400]   and far more seldom do we see people saying,
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:13.280]   okay, I'm gonna third person myself
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.000]   or I'm gonna put myself in the other person's shoes
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.400]   and say, why might they feel that way?
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:20.400]   Why would this person be listening to this individual
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.360]   as opposed to this public health individual?
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.400]   And look, without taking any stance on this
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.680]   'cause it's a much bigger conversation
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:30.120]   than we wanna have right now,
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.280]   I could look at public health officials
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:37.900]   that just completely failed to understand
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:40.680]   the other side's position and vice versa.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:43.880]   And that to me just says it's a communication failure.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:48.680]   And I'll take this out of the COVID pandemic discussion
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:51.160]   as it's normally had and say that one thing
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.960]   that we know for sure is that in the 2020 to really 2022,
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:58.660]   but still 2023 landscape,
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:01.860]   there were so many mental health concerns, right?
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:03.040]   Everybody, right?
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.040]   Regardless of where people were on the vaccine debate,
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:08.140]   mass debate, lockdown debate, regardless of any of that,
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:10.200]   everyone's stress level was elevated.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:11.040]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.680]   - And there were very, very few top down
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.980]   from at the level of government's discussions
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:20.800]   about how to maintain circadian rhythm and sleep health,
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.360]   how to maintain health in general in that landscape.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.040]   And that for me, it was just really shocking.
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.080]   It was also one of the reasons
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.020]   why we launched the podcast, frankly,
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:32.480]   is that I really feel that the tools were needed
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.620]   by everybody and should be zero cost to everybody.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:39.760]   But what was clear is there was so much pointing of fingers
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:43.260]   and name calling and violence even
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:46.320]   that no one was saying like, why would people feel this way?
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.800]   Why would people trust these sources
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:48.980]   as opposed to these sources?
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.660]   And we can only conclude if we're good scientists
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:56.660]   that the landscape was ineffective, right?
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.800]   It was just ineffective and it continues.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.560]   I mean, if you have the desire to take a reduction
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.080]   in dopamine by going on Twitter
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.720]   and following this back and forth that continues today,
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.320]   it's pretty ugly still.
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.360]   None of it seems really solution oriented.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.320]   There are a few people out there
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:16.320]   who are trying to make it solution oriented, but not really.
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:20.960]   And so I don't wanna go into the dark aspects here,
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.920]   but it does seem like this willingness to take a look
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:28.760]   at why others might feel the opposite of how we feel
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.440]   is a very rare quality.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.120]   And this gentleman, Daryl, what was his last name?
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:33.960]   - Daryl Davis.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.980]   - I think I've seen a number of things with him.
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:38.920]   I mean, he's obviously extraordinary,
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:41.120]   but we call him that because people like him
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.920]   are exceedingly rare.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.320]   So what can we do to cultivate that kind of mindset?
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.680]   Because I'm not pointing fingers here.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.400]   I mean, I think we all have this default tendency
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:53.840]   to gather evidence the way that we gather evidence,
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.960]   draw conclusions, and then stand our ground.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:59.840]   And I think it's detrimental to everyone.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.800]   - So you're making me reflect on probably the greatest gift
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:06.840]   that being a cognitive scientist has given me in my life.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:08.260]   Obviously it's fed my curiosity.
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:10.080]   It's been a delight to study things and learn things,
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:12.900]   but the greatest gift it has given me
[02:05:12.900 --> 02:05:14.860]   is empathy towards people.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:18.000]   It is the greatest driver of human empathy
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.260]   to learn how our minds work.
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:23.440]   And I don't know if there's a substitute for that.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:26.160]   Partly that's why I started a slight change of plans.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:28.880]   We have story episodes where you hear from people like Daryl,
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:31.260]   but I interview scientists from all over the world
[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:32.640]   about their areas of expertise.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.640]   And I genuinely believe that the more we learn
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.040]   about how the mind works,
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.960]   the more we learn from my field of cognitive science
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.320]   about how we make decisions,
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.980]   how we develop our attitudes and beliefs about the world,
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:47.340]   how we come to be the people that we are,
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:50.100]   the more we can bridge these empathy gaps.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.460]   And it's been profound for me.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.400]   I mean, I feel so lucky to have been steeped
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:55.700]   in this literature for decades now.
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:58.040]   My hope is to invite people into the conversation
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:59.140]   because the more you learn
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:01.640]   about why people are the way they are,
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:05.320]   the more empathy you can extend and the more,
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.760]   I'm not even saying you need to extend an olive branch.
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.800]   I'm not saying that you need to compromise
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.280]   your own belief system,
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:14.160]   but at least you see that there might be an entry point,
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:16.520]   a reason to have a discussion with this person
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.600]   who believes things that are completely different from you.
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:22.080]   And we talked about gratitude a bit in this conversation.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:25.960]   I feel immense gratitude that I have a posture of empathy
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:27.800]   as I move around in this world,
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.100]   because I have strong beliefs on things.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:31.940]   I care a lot.
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.880]   I care about reducing human suffering
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:36.600]   and that I meet someone who I think is pro a policy
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:37.840]   that promotes human suffering.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.720]   And of course, the visceral human instinct is like,
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.160]   to hell with you and your viewpoint.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.000]   This is horrible.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.280]   This is intolerable.
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:47.580]   But because I have this cognitive science hat on,
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:48.840]   it allows me to walk around
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.800]   with a slightly different viewpoint.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.180]   And I really feel that I'm a better person
[02:06:53.180 --> 02:06:54.240]   as a result of that.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:57.320]   And I've heard from listeners of a slight change of plans
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:58.760]   when they listen to these science episodes,
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.420]   whether it's the science of loneliness,
[02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:03.200]   the science of empathy, the science of meditation,
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.560]   I try to bring this empathetic spin to understanding,
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:09.760]   again, neuroscience and psychology,
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:13.620]   they have found that they are kinder to others.
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.640]   And so that's probably the best feedback
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.760]   that I've ever received on the show.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:17.980]   It's like, people are like,
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:19.780]   I'm a nicer person to other people now,
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:21.200]   especially the ones I don't agree with.
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.240]   - And presumably to themselves as well.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:26.740]   I mean, I know you've brought up the topic of empathy
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:30.840]   as a way to prevent burnout, right?
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.640]   And here, we're not just talking about job burnout.
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:36.080]   We're talking about the burnout that is inherent
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:39.020]   to like any long-term pursuit that's challenging,
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:41.160]   raising kids, being in a family.
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:43.280]   What is the great Ram Dass quote?
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:44.200]   "Think you're enlightened?
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.800]   Go spend a week with your parents."
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:47.320]   (all laughing)
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:49.400]   You know, like no matter how enlightened you are,
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.400]   it's like, I remind myself that I love my parents.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:54.320]   I love my parents,
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:58.040]   but it's just a completely different frame shift.
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.760]   So, but also kind to oneself.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:03.880]   I mean, I think there's starting to be some good neuroscience
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:06.720]   at the mechanistic level of empathy.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:11.640]   Clearly, empathy is not the default state for most people.
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:14.080]   It's something that we need to cultivate as a practice
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:16.560]   and that we can cultivate as a practice
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:17.800]   along the lines of empathy,
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.840]   but also returning to a topic
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:21.800]   that we opened today's discussion with.
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.400]   You know, we built these narratives about ourselves
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:28.120]   starting in adolescence, maybe even earlier,
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:29.280]   and through our teen years,
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.140]   and we have various experiences,
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.900]   but I'm curious how we can continue to build narratives
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.600]   about ourselves and the role of narrative.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.500]   You know, the I statements, the I am statements.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:43.920]   And whether or not you,
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.760]   and we should all spend some time doing this.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:48.880]   I mean, these days, you know,
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.160]   people exercise 'cause we know it's good for us.
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.320]   I hope people get sunlight
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.620]   'cause they know it's great for them.
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:57.440]   That people perhaps have a meditation practice
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.480]   or a therapy practice or a journaling practice,
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:01.400]   but how is it that we can continue
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.400]   to evolve our narratives about self
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.520]   in a way that promotes some or all of the things
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.560]   that we've been talking about today?
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.720]   - Yeah, so empathy is really interesting
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:13.720]   because I think we have a lot of misconceptions about it
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:14.600]   and we have misconceptions
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.740]   about how empathetic we actually are.
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:19.060]   I would argue people are more empathetic than they think.
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:19.900]   And let me tell you why.
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.260]   So this comes from research
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:23.600]   by my friend, Jamil Zaki at Stanford.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:27.240]   There's three distinct types of empathy.
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.200]   A lot of people don't know about.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.720]   So the first kind is emotional empathy.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:33.760]   And this is the one that feels very intuitive
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.600]   to most of us.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:36.260]   So it's this visceral reaction I have.
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:38.800]   You tell me that you've had a really hard time.
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.520]   My eyes start to well up.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.740]   I can truly feel your pain.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:45.760]   And I just feel what you feel, okay?
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:48.120]   And that typically is what people think of
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:50.020]   when they think of empathy, period.
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:52.300]   They overlook two other types of empathy.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:56.040]   The second type is called cognitive empathy.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.320]   This is the ability to accurately diagnose
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:03.120]   what it is that's causing you distress in this moment
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.140]   and what it is that I could offer up to you
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.440]   to try to help ameliorate some of your suffering.
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:11.900]   The third kind is called empathic concern
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.180]   or it's known as compassion as well,
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:16.840]   which is the actual desire to help you,
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:18.640]   desire to help another person.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.380]   And what's so interesting about these three types of empathy
[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.960]   is that they don't correlate within people.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:26.800]   You can be really high on the emotional empathy scale.
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.860]   You can have tears streaming down your face
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:30.960]   as you hear about your friend's divorce,
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:33.240]   but you might be really bad at diagnosing
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:35.120]   what it is that's causing them distress.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.480]   You might be really bad at actually offering up
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.480]   a solution to their problem.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.360]   Or you might lack the will.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.320]   If you're sociopathic, you might just not have the will
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.960]   to help someone.
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:49.840]   And what's so interesting is that I think in our society,
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.720]   and this relates back to identity
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.120]   and the labels we give ourselves,
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:56.520]   I think our society puts a huge premium
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:59.220]   on emotional empathy.
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:02.280]   And we discount people who don't have that visceral response
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280]   and we just immediately say, oh, they're not empathetic.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:05.200]   And this happens from the time
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.320]   that we're really little, by the way.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.280]   Like the kid who's crying on the playground
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.640]   comforting their friend, right?
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:11.520]   They're like, wow, that kid's got a ton of empathy.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.780]   Oh, my older kid doesn't seem to really care about people.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:17.080]   But they might excel in cognitive empathy.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.400]   They might excel when it comes to empathic concern.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.680]   So one of the things I was talking about with Jamil
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:24.700]   on a slight change of plans is,
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:28.080]   maybe we ought to think about empathy languages
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.220]   in the same way we think about love languages.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.520]   People have different ways of expressing their empathy
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.920]   and we ought to value them equally.
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.520]   And that's been wonderful because I think even in the past,
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.240]   I would have had a really hard situation.
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:41.760]   I go to one of my friends
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.840]   and they just seem like a little bit more stoic.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.880]   And I'm like, do you even give a shit?
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:49.160]   Why do you not care as much as I want you to care?
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:52.280]   It turns out they're fantastic at wanting to help me
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.120]   and understanding what's wrong with me.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.480]   And I love the idea of giving a little more love
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.640]   to those second two buckets
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:01.780]   because I think it'll allow us to better recruit
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.000]   more empathy from others
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.880]   and also to see ourselves differently.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:06.440]   To maybe for those people out there who are like,
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.800]   I'm not a very empathetic person.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:10.440]   You might actually be more empathetic than you think.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.120]   The second thing I wanted to share is about burnout, right?
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.280]   So you talked a little about burnout.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.240]   People who rate really high on the emotional empathy scale
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:21.160]   tend to experience burnout at higher rates.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.840]   So you can imagine healthcare workers, first responders,
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:25.700]   essentially what you're doing
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:26.940]   when you feel emotional empathy
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:29.860]   is you're carrying the burden of the other person's pain.
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.200]   So you can easily imagine how that can deplete you.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.240]   And I think the instinct that we have when we're empathetic
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.000]   is to say, you know what?
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.480]   I'm just gonna shut myself off.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.880]   I had that experience in 2020.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:42.480]   I was like, there's too much bad stuff happening around me.
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.180]   Like I prefer to just not feel things.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.240]   Thank you very much.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:46.960]   And so I tried to close myself off
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.400]   from natural emotional reactions I would have to things.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.880]   But what Jamil's research shows
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.380]   is that you don't actually have to.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:13:00.000]   If you cultivate cognitive empathy and empathic concern,
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.680]   those can actually be protective against burnout.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:05.200]   So you don't have to do away with empathy altogether.
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.800]   You just have to shift gears and be more selective
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.120]   about the kind of empathy that you're investing in.
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.400]   So I love this research because again,
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.420]   it just like opens your mind up to this whole world of empathy
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.920]   that you might've thought of as more like the singular concept
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:19.780]   and allows there to be a little bit more gray space.
[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:20.620]   - I love the idea
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:22.400]   that there are different categories of empathy.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.660]   It will also arm me with a response if ever.
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:27.100]   Hypothetically, someone says,
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.340]   I don't feel like you're really feeling what I'm feeling
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:32.180]   and therefore you're not empathic to my experience.
[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:35.980]   Where I rate on these scales isn't important,
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:38.640]   but this notion of cognitive empathy,
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:39.480]   I think it's really important
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:41.380]   and probably one that most people haven't heard of.
[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.980]   I certainly haven't heard of it,
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:46.780]   but I like to think that it really does exist
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:47.620]   and that it's at least-
[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:49.580]   - And you might have it in spades, Andrew is so.
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.720]   - I don't know, you'd have to ask the people close to me,
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:55.460]   but that it is at least as important
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.280]   as the emotional empathy.
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:58.980]   Before we conclude, there is something
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:02.840]   that I unfortunately pushed us past too quickly
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:03.800]   that I want to return to,
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.080]   because I think it's something that so many people care
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.660]   about and live with each day,
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:11.660]   which is this issue of challenges with ongoing motivation.
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:15.820]   And forgive me for doing a bit of an anachronism here.
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:17.120]   I'm sort of jumping back to this
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:19.780]   because I realized that I pulled us off to another topic,
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:23.140]   but you've talked about the middle problem before
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:27.340]   and it's too important to not return to.
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:30.060]   So tell us about the middle problem
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.980]   and how we can overcome the middle problem.
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:32.820]   - And before I do that,
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.340]   do you mind if I give just a couple short strategies
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:36.320]   around goal setting?
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:38.260]   I just want to make sure I round out that section.
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:40.860]   - Not only would I not mind, I would be delighted.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:41.900]   - Okay, I just want to make sure again,
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:43.740]   I share the wisdom that's helped me
[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.220]   so much in my personal life.
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.600]   Okay, so, and I'll try to be fast.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.440]   So the first is--
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:49.280]   - Please take your time.
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.460]   - Okay, but people have these goals to reach, right?
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:54.200]   I got to get them out running.
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:57.060]   So the first is to make sure that you are,
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:14:58.660]   so we've already talked about approach
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:00.200]   versus avoidant goals, right?
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.700]   We've talked about how who sets the goal matters
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:04.700]   and how if it's you, it's better, right?
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:07.340]   If you have some ownership over your targets.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:10.060]   The third thing is to make sure that you're setting goals
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:12.700]   when you're in the same psychological
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.380]   and physiological state as the one you'll be in
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:17.740]   when you're actually pursuing the goal.
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:19.500]   Because we tend to have what are known as,
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:21.020]   this is again, I let Fishbox work,
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:24.220]   we tend to have empathy gaps between our present day selves
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.380]   and our future selves.
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:28.680]   And that empathy gap can lead us to be very compassionate
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.680]   towards 4 p.m. on Sunday, watching TV, Maya, right?
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:37.620]   And 6 a.m. Maya, who I hope is gonna be at the gym,
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:41.420]   like killing herself with a really high intensity intervals
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:42.380]   set or whatnot.
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:45.600]   And so if it is 4 p.m. on Sunday,
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.280]   probably not the best time for you to say,
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.780]   I'm gonna go to the gym every day, 6 a.m.
[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:52.340]   If you actually are at the gym at 6 a.m.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:56.740]   and you are feeling viscerally, the physiological pain,
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:59.340]   the psychological pain of having gotten up really early
[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:00.420]   to do the workout,
[02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:03.100]   then it's reasonable for you to set that goal.
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:04.940]   But it's kind of the opposite of like they say,
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:06.900]   don't go to the supermarket hungry, right?
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:07.940]   Actually in this situation,
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:10.900]   you want to be in exactly the same physiological
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:12.320]   and psychological state you'll be in
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:13.260]   when you're in goal pursuit.
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:14.300]   It'll make it much more likely
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:17.220]   that you set reasonable goals and you actually reach them.
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:20.700]   The second thing that you might wanna think about is,
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:21.620]   so I don't know about you, Andrew,
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:24.480]   but I feel like I'm a goal purist by nature.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:26.180]   So when I set a goal,
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:30.060]   the minute I like fall off even slightly,
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:31.860]   the goal is gone for me, okay?
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:34.780]   And I'm like, ah, I messed up.
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:35.820]   Like, let's start from the beginning.
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.680]   Let's start from scratch.
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.780]   I need a new goal.
[02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:39.780]   Like I've already messed up and it doesn't matter.
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.800]   So I feel like unless I achieve perfection
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.660]   in achieving my goals, I get very frustrated
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.700]   and I just fall off the wagon completely.
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:48.340]   So one thing that researchers have shown
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:51.540]   is that it's really helpful to build in
[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:54.300]   what's called an emergency reserve into your goal setting
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:56.900]   or SLAC is another way of putting it.
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:57.960]   So let's say I have a goal.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:00.900]   I wanna go to the gym every single day this month.
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:03.500]   It's really important and helpful to give yourself
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.840]   and you're not going soft on yourself, I promise,
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:07.880]   to give yourself, for example,
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:10.560]   three get out of jail free cards.
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.000]   Three days where for whatever reason,
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.660]   it's okay that you didn't go to the gym.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:17.080]   You got sick, maybe you have kids who got sick.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:18.300]   You're just not feeling motivated.
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.140]   It doesn't really matter what the reason is.
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:20.960]   You didn't go to the gym.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:23.580]   But the important thing is that you're still on track
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:26.060]   to achieving your goal even if you miss those three days
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:27.800]   because you built them into the system.
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.460]   Okay, and the final thing I'll say
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:33.220]   about setting the goal is to try to capitalize
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:36.260]   on a phenomenon known as the fresh start effect.
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:38.020]   So this is work by my friend Katie Milkman.
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:39.860]   She's a professor at Wharton
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:41.660]   at the University of Pennsylvania.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:44.440]   So what she's found is that in our lives,
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:46.980]   we have these big milestone moments
[02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:48.740]   where we break from the past
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:50.540]   and we're entering a new future.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:53.580]   Okay, this might be moving across the country.
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:54.920]   It could be getting a new job.
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.180]   It could be getting married.
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.200]   It could be whatever, okay?
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:17:59.960]   But it feels like a big change.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.340]   And that's a wonderful moment to try to introduce
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.960]   a new set of patterns into your life.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:10.900]   In part because, again, you have a break in identity.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:14.060]   But two, it's really easy to introduce new habits
[02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:17.260]   when a lot of your environmental circumstances are different.
[02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:19.180]   So I take a new job.
[02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:21.060]   All of a sudden I have a new route to work.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:23.860]   Probably a good idea to not introduce a pastry stop
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:26.820]   every time I go to work 'cause I no longer am passing by
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.800]   that bakery every morning.
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.180]   So you wanna capitalize on fresh starts of that kind.
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:34.380]   There's also more arbitrary fresh starts
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:35.620]   that exist for all of us.
[02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:37.560]   And this is in the form of the first day of the year.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.940]   So of course, New Year's resolutions,
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:40.240]   the first day of spring.
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:42.540]   Even the first day of the week can be very motivating
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:45.280]   because we all like clean slates.
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.060]   We like wiping away the past.
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:49.500]   We like embarking on a new future
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:52.600]   that's clean of failure and stumbling and whatnot.
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:55.060]   And so that can be a really powerful motivator.
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:57.020]   I love these suggestions
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:59.880]   because I do think that we like a clean start.
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.440]   There's something to that.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:06.140]   Who knows why, but I think it's a universal trait.
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.680]   And perhaps shortening the time domain
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:10.700]   over which we think about our goals
[02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:12.300]   and success and failure could help.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.940]   Like if they just say, the clean start is this afternoon
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:18.260]   because this morning didn't go so well.
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:19.700]   - Yeah, you don't have to surrender the whole week
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:21.340]   just 'cause you messed up on a Monday morning.
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:22.180]   - That's right.
[02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:23.800]   I'm sensing the perfectionist in you.
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:25.740]   And I know that it's a continuum.
[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:28.500]   Some people don't, I don't wanna say suffer
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:31.240]   from perfectionism 'cause I think it's a great attribute
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:34.380]   in certain domains and can be challenging in others.
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:39.380]   But I love the idea of having a little bit of grace
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:43.980]   with one's goals and also what you said earlier
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:47.580]   of making the carrot compelling
[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:50.740]   and not so much focusing on just the stick,
[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:53.720]   making the carrot more compelling, so much there.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:55.920]   What about the middle problem?
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.760]   - Yes, okay.
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:00.820]   - Because I do think that people do tend to go hard
[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:05.760]   out the gate as it were and then people drop off.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:09.160]   - Yeah, so yeah, all this stuff we talked about so far
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:10.580]   has been around defining the goal.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:13.480]   And now we need to think about how we sustain our motivation
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:14.400]   to pursue the goal.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:15.880]   And this can be super hard.
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:18.840]   Again, behavior change is incredibly,
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:21.240]   incredibly hard to sustain.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:23.340]   So the middle problem.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.160]   So the middle problem refers to the fact
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.800]   that we don't have stable amounts of motivation
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.900]   over the course of goal pursuit.
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:32.460]   We tend to have a boost in motivation
[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:33.820]   at the beginning of the pursuit.
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:35.340]   We all feel this viscerally, right?
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:38.220]   I've decided I'm gonna do intermittent fasting
[02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:40.580]   or I'm gonna make sure I look at the sun every morning,
[02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:43.900]   the first moment that I get up or whatever the goal is.
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.920]   And that first day you are so motivated to get it done.
[02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:49.260]   In fact, the first few days, the first few weeks.
[02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:53.060]   And then you experience a boost in motivation,
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:55.460]   a higher amount of motivation towards the end of the goal.
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:56.760]   So we experience at the end of a goal
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.460]   what's known as the goal gradient effect.
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:02.380]   So we tend to experience monotonic increases in motivation
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:04.820]   the closer we are to the finish line.
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:06.580]   So we might even see in marathon runners, right?
[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:08.720]   They're like, okay, I only have this remaining part to go.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:10.340]   I can expend all my energy now
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:12.500]   to try to get over the finish line.
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:15.100]   There's a lull though in motivation
[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:16.780]   in the middle of goal pursuit.
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:18.340]   And that's something that we wanna get ahead of,
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:19.980]   we wanna solve for.
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:22.660]   Now, obviously we cannot eliminate middles,
[02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:24.780]   mathematically impossible to eliminate middles.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:25.780]   So what do we do?
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.700]   Well, we do something that you already alluded to,
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:31.300]   which is actually we shorten the time duration of our goals.
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.440]   So rather than setting an annual goal, right?
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.640]   Let's say that it's the new year,
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.500]   you're inspired to try to make 2023 the best year ever.
[02:21:38.500 --> 02:21:41.040]   But the problem with that is when you set an annual goal,
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.840]   now your middle is months long.
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:45.460]   So you're gonna experience that decrease in motivation
[02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:48.420]   for a healthy chunk of the year, which is not ideal.
[02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:50.780]   If you set a weekly goal by contrast,
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:53.900]   all of a sudden your middle's a lot shorter, right?
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:56.540]   All of a sudden you're dealing with like a few days,
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:57.540]   maybe a day or two.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:02.540]   And so you wanna be mindful of the duration of the goal.
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:06.120]   Another thing that can help keep motivation high
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:08.260]   is to do what my friend Katie Milkman
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.980]   calls temptation bundling.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:13.580]   So this has never one been my go-to strategy
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.340]   for having done every unpleasant activity in my life
[02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:18.080]   that I've had to do, okay?
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.980]   Folding laundry, doing the dishes.
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:21.600]   I actually really like working out like you do,
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:23.060]   so I don't need as much motivation,
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:25.660]   but sometimes I still need for high intensity days,
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:28.260]   I do need the motivation to do like the hard cardio.
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:33.260]   So to get on into working out in that way.
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:35.060]   So what is temptation bundling?
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:37.740]   You're pairing an unpleasant activity,
[02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:40.460]   like folding laundry, doing dishes, taking out the trash
[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:44.460]   with an immediately rewarding, enjoyable activity.
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.100]   That can be listening to your favorite podcasts,
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.580]   which are of course the Huberman Lab
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:51.280]   and A Slight Change of Plans, obviously.
[02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:54.340]   It could be listening to your favorite pop music.
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:57.100]   But the really critical piece of the temptation bundling
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:59.700]   is that you have to forego the indulgence
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.980]   of enjoying that rewarding activity
[02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:04.500]   in all other spaces of your life.
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:08.300]   So for example, for me, I feel like a good pop song,
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:11.180]   I have like 25 really good listens
[02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:12.580]   and then it kind of becomes old hat.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:16.020]   So just like, the excitement of the song wears off a bit.
[02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.300]   So there've been times where I'll be like
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:19.280]   cooking with my husband and he's like,
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:22.780]   "Hey, why don't we play, you love Kacey Musgraves,
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:23.940]   why don't we play that album?"
[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:26.200]   And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, that's an album
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:28.660]   I can only listen to when I'm like lifting weights."
[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:30.420]   - Maintain the potency.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:31.940]   - You have to maintain the potency, right?
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:34.420]   You don't allow yourself to get the joy
[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:35.820]   and edification of the Huberman Lab
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:37.300]   when you're not taking a walk
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.100]   and getting exposure to that morning sunlight.
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:42.580]   And it's such a simple strategy when you think about it,
[02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:45.060]   but I have found myself looking forward
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.380]   to really annoying tasks that I have to get done
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:51.140]   because I know I'm gonna get the enjoyment
[02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:53.780]   of something really fun that accompanies it.
[02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:56.220]   - Fantastic, is it important that the thing
[02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:59.300]   that one enjoys be done simultaneously?
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:00.540]   - Yeah. - So folding laundry
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:02.340]   while watching the Netflix thing
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:05.420]   or listening to a particular piece of music?
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:06.740]   - Yeah, you want them to coexist
[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:08.180]   because then again, you get that immediately
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:10.460]   or most of the time, the things that we lament doing
[02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:13.500]   have really positive long-term outcomes, right?
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:16.260]   If I'm in the habit of keeping my house clean,
[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:17.220]   there's long-term benefits.
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:19.180]   If I'm in the habit of exercising or eating healthily,
[02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:20.540]   there's long-term benefits,
[02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:23.940]   but I don't often feel the rewards in real time.
[02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.940]   So what you're trying to do is give yourself
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:27.660]   that rush of joy and excitement
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:30.100]   that accompanies the immediately rewarding activity
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:32.900]   so that in your mind, even just like neurally,
[02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:35.000]   the two things are coexisting.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.980]   - Love it because it has such firm grounding
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:39.420]   in the neurobiology of reward and aversion
[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:41.080]   and how to overcome aversion.
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:43.980]   There's deep neuroscience around this,
[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:45.660]   but I've never heard it presented that way.
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:48.800]   So thank you for those incredibly clear
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:51.300]   and actionable tools for motivation
[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:53.140]   because so many people struggle with that.
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:54.320]   - Yeah. - And I hear that
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:55.160]   all the time.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.660]   - And I think, you talked about aversion
[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:58.100]   and actually this is really important.
[02:24:58.100 --> 02:25:01.080]   So when we think about returning to our goals,
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.220]   which is often the hard thing,
[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:04.720]   so you do it on a Monday and you have that same goal
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:06.460]   on a Tuesday and then on a Wednesday, on a Thursday,
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:07.860]   and by Thursday, you're kind of like,
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:10.260]   oh my God, it was so hard the first few days.
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:12.260]   Do I really wanna go back and do that,
[02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:14.020]   do the same workout on a Thursday?
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:18.140]   What's really helpful here to avoid some of that aversion
[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:21.300]   is to be mindful of the way
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:23.260]   in which our minds process memories.
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:26.580]   So when we reflect back on how much we enjoyed
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:28.400]   or didn't enjoy an experience,
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:31.380]   we don't give equal weight to every moment.
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:33.500]   Each moment doesn't get uniform weight.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.800]   Instead, we tend to give more weight
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.320]   to what's called the peak of the experience.
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:42.280]   So the experience that was most emotionally intense,
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:43.120]   the part of the experience
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.560]   that was the most emotionally intense
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.100]   and the end of the experience.
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:50.920]   So this is work done by Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.200]   and his collaborator Amos Tversky.
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.240]   So the peak end rule is what this is called.
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:56.860]   So you put a lot of weight on, again,
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:25:58.920]   that really emotionally intense moment of the experience
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:00.280]   and the end.
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:02.800]   Now, researchers have studied this in the context
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:04.860]   of lots of unpleasant activities.
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:08.380]   So in some studies, people are forced to plunge,
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.700]   submerge their hands in like ice cold water,
[02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:13.060]   or they looked at colonoscopies, for example,
[02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:14.940]   and how unpleasant those are.
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:18.980]   And what they found is that this is so interesting.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.820]   So, okay, I'm nerding out a little bit
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.900]   'cause I just like think that this field is so cool.
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:25.260]   Okay, so just having--
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:26.940]   - Nerding out isn't just tolerated,
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:29.180]   it is encouraged on this podcast.
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.980]   - I'm having a moment with cognitive science.
[02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:33.120]   This is such cool research
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.960]   'cause what these researchers did, it's so clever.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:39.240]   If you elongate the unpleasant experience
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.780]   by a couple minutes, let's say,
[02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:45.360]   so the hands in freezing cold ice water or the colonoscopy,
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.180]   but you make those last few minutes
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:51.260]   of the unpleasant experience slightly less unpleasant
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:53.460]   than the end of the experience would otherwise have been.
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:55.740]   Had you just ended the colonoscopy procedure as planned,
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:59.100]   had you just taken the hands right out of the ice bucket
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:02.500]   by, for example, increasing the temperature of the water
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:05.540]   by a degree or use your imaginations,
[02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:06.360]   whatever the equivalent is.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.380]   - I was gonna say, how can you make a colonoscopy less--
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:12.100]   - There are mechanisms by which the pain can be less intense.
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:13.540]   - Physicians everywhere know them,
[02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:17.140]   but we are oblivious to them.
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:19.380]   - Anyway, you guys can do the mental work
[02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:20.220]   of figuring out what the equivalent is.
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:22.740]   - On Google. - On Google, on Google.
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:25.900]   What they find is that people look back
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.700]   on the experience more favorably.
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.500]   They have a more positive impression of the experience.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:34.660]   Now, again, this is what's so miraculous about this finding.
[02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:37.880]   The overall duration of the unpleasant experience
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.120]   has been extended.
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:43.560]   There are more minutes of overall suffering, right?
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:45.980]   But the last few minutes are less bad
[02:27:45.980 --> 02:27:47.100]   than they would have been otherwise.
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:50.540]   And so people are, they view the experience more favorably.
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.780]   In the case of the colonoscopies,
[02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:53.460]   they were actually more likely to return
[02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:56.440]   for follow-up visits for their annual checkups.
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:58.620]   And so what does this mean in daily life?
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:00.240]   Well, what it can mean is,
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:03.580]   let's say you're like literally killing yourself at the gym.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:06.620]   Okay, you have the hardest workout that you've ever had.
[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:09.400]   Tack on a few minutes to the end of the workout
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:10.580]   that are still unpleasant.
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:13.000]   So you're still coding them as being part
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.340]   of the unpleasant working out experience,
[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:18.520]   but are a little bit less intense and less painful
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:20.620]   than the workout and would have been otherwise,
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:22.240]   you might be more likely to return
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:24.180]   and actually do the hard workout.
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:27.140]   - Can we also say if somebody really enjoys their training,
[02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:29.740]   that the opposite would be effective as well,
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:32.820]   that perhaps if they really want to push it hard at the end,
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:35.260]   because that's the sensation that they particularly enjoy,
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:38.060]   that that could serve presumably the memory systems
[02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:39.580]   and the reward systems of the brain,
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:40.780]   such that they are more likely
[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:42.020]   to return to the workout again.
[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:43.860]   - Absolutely, you raise a fantastic point,
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:47.020]   which is when we talk about enjoyment in these contexts,
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.760]   it is all subjective.
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:52.020]   So I actually kind of love the feeling like I'm going to die
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:53.960]   because my heart is racing.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:54.800]   So I mean, for whatever reason,
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.100]   I'm just wired to love exercise, right?
[02:28:57.100 --> 02:29:00.300]   And I love a heart strength training workout, right?
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:04.020]   And so for me, what enjoyment might look like at the end
[02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:06.420]   is like really, really, really intense, right?
[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:07.680]   That might be what brings me back.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:10.000]   But in other domains, absolutely not.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.380]   Like that colonoscopy situation,
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:14.580]   I do not want that to be an unpleasant experience.
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:16.980]   And so there are lots of other domains in life
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:19.020]   where if you just tack on a few minutes
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:21.580]   onto something that's really tedious or really hard
[02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:22.680]   or really painful,
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:24.660]   it can make you more likely to commit to it later.
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:25.820]   But it's an excellent point.
[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:27.020]   In all of these studies,
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:29.700]   you have to consider who the person is
[02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:31.580]   and what their natural psychology is like.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:32.520]   And for everyone listening,
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.540]   you want to tailor these recommendations
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:36.300]   to who you are as a person.
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:37.860]   - Well, there are certain life demands
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:39.980]   that I find incredibly aversive.
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:41.940]   So I'm going to use this approach for those.
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:43.700]   I'm also going to use them
[02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:45.900]   in the context of things I really enjoy,
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:49.140]   because if one has the opportunity, I believe,
[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:51.780]   to further reinforce the things that bring us joy,
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:52.900]   why wouldn't we?
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:54.180]   - Absolutely.
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:56.260]   - Fantastic recommendations.
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:59.700]   So now I could ask you a thousand more questions.
[02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:01.240]   And my hope is that you'll come back
[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:04.860]   so that I can ask those thousand plus more questions.
[02:30:04.860 --> 02:30:07.820]   I have to say it is exceedingly rare
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:11.860]   that I talk to somebody either on the podcast or elsewhere,
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:14.540]   frankly, in my life that has such an incredibly
[02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:17.900]   wide breadth of knowledge
[02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:20.140]   and yet has so much depth of knowledge as well.
[02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:22.740]   It's clear that your many experiences through music
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:25.020]   and cognitive science, podcasting,
[02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:27.900]   and by the way, we're going to provide links to your podcast
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:28.900]   in the show note captions
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:32.300]   so that people can hear more from you as they should,
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:33.900]   and also your work in policy.
[02:30:33.900 --> 02:30:36.480]   I mean, you've put yourself in a lot of different domains,
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:38.860]   and I think that itself is inspiring.
[02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:41.660]   And whether or not it's by way of curiosity,
[02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:45.020]   human connection, or both, presumably it's both,
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:46.900]   and many other things as well.
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:49.540]   I know I speak on behalf of many, many people.
[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.500]   I just say, thank you so much for doing the work
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:55.180]   that you do for continuing along these pursuits.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:56.940]   I'm excited to hear where it might evolve
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:31:00.720]   in the future still, and frankly, just for being you,
[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:04.500]   because it's clear that your enthusiasm, your curiosity,
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:08.100]   and your generosity with useful information is immense.
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:09.460]   So thank you ever so much.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:12.340]   - Well, that's so gracious and kind of you to say, Andrew,
[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:16.380]   and these conversations, like the one we just had,
[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:17.680]   I mean, it's why I do the work.
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:20.180]   It's so much fun and so interesting,
[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:22.220]   and you've given me so much food for thought.
[02:31:22.220 --> 02:31:24.300]   It really was a conversation, not an interview,
[02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:25.120]   and that's such a gift.
[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.820]   And so I just feel gratitude that I can share
[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:31.060]   my body of work and all the insights I've learned
[02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:32.460]   along the way with your listeners,
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.340]   and I really hope it's helpful to them.
[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:37.500]   - It certainly is, and it's been an honor to have you here,
[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:38.740]   so let's do it again.
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:39.660]   - Yes, let's do it again.
[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:41.740]   Thanks so much. - Thank you.
[02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:43.660]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:31:43.660 --> 02:31:46.580]   about identity and goals and motivation

[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:22.060]   Not on today's podcast, but on many previous episodes
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:24.620]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:26.740]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.900]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:32.340]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.620]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:35.260]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:36.980]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed

[02:33:03.580 --> 02:33:05.500]   for instance, tools to improve sleep,
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:07.620]   tools to improve neuroplasticity.
[02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:10.440]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:11.720]   various aspects of mental health.
[02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:14.180]   Again, all completely zero cost, and to sign up,

[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.820]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms,
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:30.780]   so that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook,
[02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:32.380]   and at all of those places,
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:34.380]   I talk about science and science-related tools,
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:35.420]   some of which overlaps
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:37.060]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:38.380]   but much of which is distinct
[02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:40.460]   from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:43.500]   Again, it's @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:44.820]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:47.400]   for today's discussion with Dr. Maya Shankar,
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.440]   and last, but certainly not least,
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:51.180]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:33:51.180 --> 02:33:53.760]   [upbeat music]
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:56.360]   (upbeat music)
