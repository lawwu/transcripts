[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   So today I want to talk about a common feature that comes up when you study the lives of
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.560]   people who have embraced depth, that is, they are living deep lives.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.640]   And this common feature is they often are notably good at something valuable, right?
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.360]   So if you can be a 10x coder or throw a baseball that's hard to hit or write in a way that
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.280]   is compulsively readable, your options for cultivating a remarkable existence expand
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.860]   significantly, right?
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.000]   Because it's rewarding to be good at something.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   Humans crave mastery.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.720]   It can provide you financial independence, which gives you a lot of control over how
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.920]   you live and work.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.660]   You can shape the rhythms of your life in unique and interesting ways.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.600]   And mastery tends to open up interesting varieties and interesting opportunities of the type
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400]   that makes your life itself more interesting.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.080]   Let me be specific about it because I was just talking to him the other day.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.440]   Let's consider my friend, the writer, Ryan Holiday.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.680]   He got very good at pragmatic nonfiction writing.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.280]   In fact, he basically, over the last decade or so, revolutionized how the genre of pragmatic
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.600]   nonfiction can function in the internet age.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.480]   So I went down to Texas last spring to visit him, and he has built this really interesting
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.580]   life.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.560]   So him and his wife own this really cool bookstore, The Painted Porch, in a quaint town in Texas
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440]   that's about 30 miles outside of Austin.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.340]   He works in an office suite that's up above this coolly decorated bookstore, and his team
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.560]   works up there.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.580]   He records his podcast next door.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.000]   They bought the building next door.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   It has a generic storefront, and then behind it is this beautiful studio.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.400]   Behind that is the space where he has his editors and graphics people are all working.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920]   They have this back porch behind.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   I went for a nice walk while I was there.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400]   You can just walk from this building down to the river, and there's this long path you
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.840]   can walk on.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920]   People come from all over to just hang out at this bookstore.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.680]   There's a steady stream of fascinating writers, athletes, and actors that make the pilgrimage
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   there to hang out with Ryan and record in his studio, and when he wants some more quiet,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.920]   he retreats right outside of town to his 50-acre property where there's cattle and a pond,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   and it's quiet.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.520]   You can go for a long walk without ever leaving land that you actually own.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   On top of that, Ryan, his life has a lot of interesting adventures.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.160]   He goes and hangs out with NFL teams and just got back from Australia and hung out with
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.080]   Arnold Schwarzenegger not long ago.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.160]   The point here, I'm using Ryan as a case study.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.840]   The point here is that getting notably good at something valuable is a powerful tool for
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.020]   crafting a deep life.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.800]   Let's talk a little bit today about how people get good at things that are valuable.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.460]   I have three rules I want to share.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.880]   Rule one is something I informally call the 10-year rule, and to make it a little bit
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.580]   more clear what I'm talking about, I actually want to play a little bit of tape here.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.560]   This is from the Rewatchables podcast, Bill Simmons' Rewatchables podcast, one of my favorites.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.360]   They're talking here in this clip about Quentin Tarantino, his rise in the '90s, and Pulp
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Fiction.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   It's also going to be a little bit about Bill itself.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.260]   Let's listen to it, and then I'm going to analyze it for you.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.500]   It felt like in '94, the ceiling just came off.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.120]   That's definitely how it felt and how it was narrativized.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.920]   If you listen to Tarantino talk about it, he's basically spent eight years in obscurity
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.480]   trying to get stuff made.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.240]   That was a great story to tell in magazines about this guy who came out of nowhere to
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.120]   take over movies forever, but that isn't really what happened.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.560]   He tried to get this 60-millimeter movie off the ground for years and years.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.760]   He was shooting it on the weekends, just like Kevin Smith shot Clerks, self-funding, trying
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   to write his own ticket in that way.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.120]   It took a really long time, and it took him convincing people to give him money.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.920]   He talks about the story about getting Richard Gladstein to give him money from live entertainment
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   for Reservoir Dogs.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.880]   He worked really hard for a long time, dead broke, thinking he was going to fail.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   There's this tension in the storytelling where you're like, "Wow, you could do it too, but
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.920]   you also have to [expletive] for a decade and maybe not succeed."
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.120]   By the way, I completely identify it because when I went to ESPN in 2001, I had the calm,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   and then it was like, "Oh, yeah.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   You were at the forefront of when the internet and sport..."
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.020]   I was like, "Yeah, I [expletive] from '93 to 2001, and I was on my own, and nobody read
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.320]   anything I did."
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.760]   When you read the stuff about how long it took him even to get meetings with people,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.960]   you're just like, "This guy's just going to work and [expletive]."
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   All right.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.600]   That was Bill Simmons talking with Chris Ryan and Sean Finnessey on the Rewatchables.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   All right.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.320]   Here's what was important about that clip, why it caught my attention when I first heard
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   it.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.000]   Tarantino took about a decade to get to where he was going.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.880]   The myth, as Chris made clear in that clip, the myth is 1993, this guy comes out of nowhere,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.400]   Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, boom.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.040]   The reality was almost a decade of him out there working, trying to make...
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.160]   They're filming Reservoir Dogs on 60mm.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   They're trying to make it work.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.280]   They're trying to get funding.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.460]   He was selling some scripts.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.920]   He was doing anything he could.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.780]   Then Bill Simmons spoke up and said, "Yeah, that was the same for me."
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.880]   People remember him and Grantland at ESPN like, "Oh, Bill Simmons came out of nowhere
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   and sort of revolutionized sports coverage and using podcasts and blogging for doing
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   so."
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   He was like, "Well, wait a second.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.760]   That was eight years before that, before things really started to click."
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.720]   So 10 years more or less is what it took Tarantino, 10 years more or less is what it took Bill
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.160]   Simmons to actually start to make a mark in what they were working on.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.300]   This rule, which I call the 10-year rule, give or take a couple years in either direction,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.560]   is pretty ironclad when you look at people who do really cool things.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.840]   I mean, this is true of my own life.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.520]   When did my first book come out?
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   2006.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.800]   This one was my first hit book, 2016, 10 years.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   Steve Martin, I recently reread his professional memoir, Born Standing Up.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.480]   I wrote a whole thing about it for my most recent book, Slow Productivity, which I cut.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.680]   But I did all the math for this section that I cut about Steve Martin.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   It took about a decade after he quit his comedy writing job full-time to do stand-up to really
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.840]   begin to explode in the stand-up world.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.720]   Now sometimes you will find people who make their move faster, but oftentimes in these
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.380]   stories what you'll realize is they're doing basically 10 years worth of work, but they're
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.240]   just like confining it like a madman to a shorter period of time.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.640]   Michael Crichton's a great example of this.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.960]   There's only a three-year gap between the publication of his first book in 1966 and
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.460]   his first hit book, The Adronomous Train, which came out in 1969.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.980]   But during that three-year period, he published five books before he got to The Adronomous
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980]   Train.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.200]   They were all published under his pseudonym, Zhang Ling.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.540]   They were like potboiler spy adventure thrillers.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.380]   So that's like 10 years worth of writing.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.640]   He just collapsed like a madman into three years, but he was doing 10 years worth of
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   work.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.580]   And honestly, there was another three years after that before his next book under his
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.780]   own name came out.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.060]   So you can really think about it as really like a six or seven-year period before he
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.540]   was regularly writing books under his own name.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.540]   All right.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.820]   So the conclusion here for this rule is that getting good at something that is unambiguously
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.380]   valuable, it takes a lot of time.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.420]   It takes a lot of effort.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.700]   In some sense, that's the bad news.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.480]   You're not going to be able to have Ryan Holiday's life next year.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.000]   But in other ways, that's the good news because most people are not willing to stick with
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.900]   something that long.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.500]   So when you're thinking about the odds of success in one of these interesting fields,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.640]   there's two odds to consider.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.460]   The odds of just anyone who starts down this path, what are their odds of succeeding versus
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.620]   what are the odds of someone who sticks with this seriously for a decade?
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.900]   What are their odds of succeeding?
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:09.180]   So maybe for example, one in a thousand people who set out to become a writer and write novels
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.820]   actually becomes like a sustainable professional novelist, right?
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.060]   Next month or maybe November, I guess, is National Novel Writing Month and all over
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.140]   the country, people will sort of try to kick off their writing careers and maybe it's like
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.380]   a one in a thousand of them are going to actually succeed.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:29.180]   But what are the odds if you say, let's just consider people who give it a decade of concerted
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   effort?
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.820]   What are the odds that someone in that position succeeds in professional writing?
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.500]   I bet it's like one in three, right?
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.860]   So your odds radically change if you're willing to stick with something over a longer period
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.860]   of time.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.580]   And you could see that as bad news because it takes more time than you might hope to
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.740]   get good at something, or you see it as good news because that's a barrier that's going
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.660]   to squeeze out 99% of people who might be competing for those same limited slots.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.660]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.460]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:06.940]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.380]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.740]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.540]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   Check it out.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.020]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.020]   All right.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:31.220]   Rule number two, you must relentlessly expand, explore, and exploit.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.060]   I'm trying to be alliterative here, so I'll have to explain what I mean by each of these
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   words.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.620]   To understand expand, I want you to think about a common observation.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:47.300]   If you go to a gym, a normal gym, there's usually a crowd of guys in their upper 40s
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.360]   and 50s who are just cycling from machine to machine, and they're going through the
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.900]   motions with a moderate amount of weight on, just knocking out their reps and then moving
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.660]   on to the next machine, checking things off of a list.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.380]   If you talk to these guys, almost always they're there because their doctor said, "Look, we're
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.300]   looking at these numbers from your blood panels.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.020]   You got to exercise because we worry about your heart."
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.020]   Very common.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.020]   They're cardiologists, mid-40s.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.300]   "You got to go exercise."
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.980]   They're kind of doing, "Look, I'm here, I'm exercising, I'm doing lots of machines."
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.940]   The thing here, of course, is what they're doing is not going to make them super strong.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.700]   It's not going to make them much stronger at all.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.380]   We know what's involved for muscle growth or strength growing, and you have to make
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.240]   a concerted effort to exhaust muscles.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.860]   It's difficult, it's uncomfortable, but you have to do that if you want to get stronger.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.860]   These guys aren't getting stronger.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.960]   It's not bad, they're doing it, but they're just sort of going through the motions.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.180]   This applies to when we think about the 10 years it takes to get good at something.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.700]   If you spend those 10 years doing the equivalent of the middle-aged guys on the machines in
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.900]   the gym, nothing's going to happen, right?
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.940]   So if you're just sort of, "I just kind of have my writing time every morning and I get
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.460]   my pages in," and you're sort of just doing this year after year, you're not guaranteed
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.460]   to get much better.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.660]   You're not guaranteed to actually increase your odds.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.420]   What you actually have to do during those 10 years for them to actually be useful is
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.860]   you need to deliberately improve your skills.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.140]   That's what I mean by expand.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:25.820]   You have to expand your actual abilities, and this requires that you look to relentlessly
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:32.380]   stretch yourself beyond where you're comfortable on the areas you need to get better at, right?
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.060]   Just like if you want to make that muscle stronger, you can't just sit down and do the
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.980]   butterfly machine with 25 pounds and move on to the next thing.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.780]   You have to do, like I was doing the other day and I hate, you just have to do is you
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.640]   have to get on an incline bench and get those 45-pound dumbbells and just do set after set,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.300]   and it really kind of stinks, but you're putting the real weight on the real muscles.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.980]   You got to do the same thing with whatever it is that you're trying to get better at.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.140]   I mean, look, I'll go back to our example before of Ryan Holiday, right?
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.020]   2014, he published his Obstacle is the Way.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.380]   This kicks off what's going to be his career where he finally succeeds as writing about
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.000]   stoicism for a big audience, but that book doesn't do great out of the gates.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.180]   People forget that book doesn't hit a bestseller list until five years after it comes out,
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.380]   after he's already sort of off to the races.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.780]   So he's right away sold his next book, Ego is the Enemy.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.820]   He was like, "I'm going to give this a try."
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.700]   And I remember talking to him during this point.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.340]   He was very systematic about how do I make this better?
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.420]   What is it that's, where can I improve myself?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.740]   Where are the points where I have actual ground I can make up that's going to make this book
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.940]   better than the last one?
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.380]   He was stretching, like where I want to not just be working towards this goal of being
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.780]   a professional nonfiction writer, I need to be working at getting better.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.300]   There's a sort of relentlessness there.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.540]   Crichton was the same way.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.380]   He relentlessly wrote these thriller novels under pseudonyms.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:07.180]   This was like a lower barrier of entry and it allowed him to practice the different elements
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.500]   of writing like a really high quality thriller type novel.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.580]   I own a lot of these.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.940]   They re-released them not long ago.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.260]   I own a lot of these and they're not like a later Crichton book, right?
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.300]   They're much simpler.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.260]   You can see he's working, they'll have technology in it.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.380]   You can see he's still working with how do you bring technology into these books.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.220]   They have some preposterous characters that are cardboard that he gets better at making
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.120]   the characters a little bit more interesting.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.400]   You can see there's plotting, pacing elements that he starts to get better at.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.020]   Even with his first book, The Adronomous Strain, he wrote that book.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:49.780]   And his editor, the famed editor Robert Gottlieb, who before that ran The New Yorker, basically
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.340]   said to him, "We got to rewrite this from scratch."
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.520]   He went through this whole training process where he wrote The Adronomous Strain with
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.060]   a lot more interiority and psychological realism.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.580]   They said, "Look, you're not Tolstoy.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.100]   We got to rewrite this book.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.240]   It's not about the psychological life of these scientists who are fighting this virus.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.300]   It's about the fact this virus is getting through the seals, or I guess it's a bacteria,
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.860]   and everyone's going to die, and the clock is ticking.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.660]   Rewrite this like a New Yorker piece, like Richard Preston reporting on the Ebola outbreak
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.380]   in Reston, Virginia later on.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.660]   Write this like you're reporting on something that happened that was exciting, and rewrite
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.040]   that book from scratch.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.260]   This is all deliberately expanding skills.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.100]   So yeah, it takes 10 years, but it has to be 10 years of getting better.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:40.860]   All right, explore, that was the second piece of our alliterative trio here, explore.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.260]   The other thing you notice when you study people who go through this period of becoming
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.600]   good at something notably good is that they're constantly looking around for opportunities
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.900]   within the general direction that they're pursuing.
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.800]   There's like this paradox to this.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.860]   You need to stay focused on one thing for a long time, but within this one thing, you
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.500]   have to be incredibly agile, looking around, where is my traction point?
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.900]   Basically this means finding places to actually like produce and ship something that other
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.460]   people are going to see or care about or pay you for.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.460]   These are the traction points you can actually move.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.820]   If you don't have traction, you can't move forward.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.820]   And you see this a lot.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.340]   It's like Crichton trying with these thriller novels.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.020]   He also wrote a lot of nonfiction books, and he was trying to figure out where his niche
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.260]   was as a writer.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.860]   He was trying lots of things.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.380]   Ryan Holiday tried lots of things.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.140]   His first book was about marketing.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.020]   The same year that Obstacles the Way came out, he tried publishing a digital-only book
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.860]   called Growth Hacker Marketing.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.700]   He was thinking, "Am I a marketer?
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.780]   Is that my space?
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.460]   Is the stoicism thing going to work?"
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.940]   He was trying lots of things.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.860]   My similar in my career is, "Let me try this book.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.860]   Let me try that.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.860]   Let me write for this place."
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.900]   It's all within walls of like, "I want to be a writer," but you're exploring.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:57.060]   You have to keep looking for opportunities within the field that you're in.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.020]   That brings us to the third element from rule two, which is exploit.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:06.940]   The people who really make their move, when their exploration finds something that has
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.780]   traction, they mash the accelerator.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.900]   "Oh, this is working.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.900]   Let's get after it."
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.380]   So I'm going to follow these same examples.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.380]   Ego is the enemy.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.980]   Holiday's second book does better.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   There's traction here.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.860]   He's like, "Okay, we're doing the stoicism thing."
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:30.060]   Exploitation point number two, he starts a daily newsletter, The Daily Stoic, based off
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.860]   of the book he put out called The Daily Stoic.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.420]   That model takes off.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.900]   Now he's off to the races.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.660]   He's like, "Oh, I see.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.660]   Daily newsletters."
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.780]   He now has three, Daily Dad, Daily Stoic, and one called Daily Philosophy.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.580]   He ramped up this format for stoicism, this story-based format built around a single principle,
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.580]   "Let's go."
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.500]   He's seven books since, just boom, boom, boom, "Let's go."
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   Build the audience.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.500]   Find a thing to work.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   Let's go for it.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.300]   For Crichton, it was really Terminal Man, his follow-up to Adronomous Train.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.380]   He's like, "I think this might be it."
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.260]   He experiments with his third and fourth book are out of the techno-thriller genre.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.900]   He wrote The Great Train Robbery and Eaters of the Dead.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.540]   These are books that no one associates with Crichton.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.700]   After that, it's all Michael Crichton techno-thriller, one book every year, every other year.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.300]   I'm going to war with Clancy and Grisham.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Let's go.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.220]   He's going to mash that accelerator, and that's where he was going after then.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.980]   When you discover what's working, you're like, "Great.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.540]   We have to give that a huge amount of effort.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.540]   We got to really push that."
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.060]   It's not just taking 10 years.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.580]   It's what you're doing during those 10 years.
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.740]   That's a lot to handle, so that brings us to rule number three.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.540]   You must abandon distractions.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:53.580]   The core of this podcast, of course, is cultivating a deep life in a distracting world.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.940]   It's in this world with largely digital distractions of both work and our life outside of work.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.900]   How do we navigate and build full human lives?
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   That's what I care about.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.900]   I'm a computer scientist.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.900]   I'm a digital theorist.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.500]   I care about that angle.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.660]   It plays a big role here.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:16.500]   You cannot succeed with all of the expanding, the exploration, and the exploitation for
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.740]   10 years within a narrow field if you're looking at your phone all the time.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.060]   If you're looking at highly engaging, addictive social platform or content platforms all the
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.380]   time, it is just stealing the brain cycles you need to actually build a cool thing, to
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.740]   do the thing that's going to allow you to actually craft the cool life.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   We're talking TikTok.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.540]   We're talking Instagram.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:45.500]   We're talking YouTube recommendation wandering, wander from recommendation to recommendation.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   We're talking Twitter.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.440]   Now, there's a couple of forces at play here that makes these particularly pernicious.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.140]   The first one is the obvious one.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   You spend more time looking at these things as time you could have been spending on your
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.140]   pursuit.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.340]   It just steals time.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.940]   We know that to be true.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.100]   This was actually, and I've made this point, I want to keep preaching this point.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.100]   The point I had in my book, Digital Minimalism, which was a little bit counter-cultural at
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.620]   the time and remains counter-cultural today, I said, "Hey, when we're thinking about digital
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:20.260]   distraction in our personal lives, like what's happening on our phones, don't get so side
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.420]   tracked by the what of what people are looking at.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.140]   What matters is the how long."
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.780]   All of the interest in this topic was, no, what matters, and it continues to be this
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.420]   way today, what matters is what's distracting people.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.960]   The content is, it's bad content.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.820]   It's the wrong people putting out content.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.660]   It's misinformation.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.380]   It's making you mad.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.180]   It's making you crazy.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.220]   It's all about the content is what's wrong.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   I said, "Forget that."
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.020]   This is not what I'm picking up from the average person.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.220]   The average person is not on Twitter yelling at people.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.100]   The average person is upset by how long they're looking at these things.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.780]   That's what matters.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.660]   It matters because it takes away time from other things, and in particular, none of these
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.600]   people I talked about spend a lot of time looking on their phones because they're building
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.140]   the stuff that made their life cool.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.140]   Ryan doesn't look at social media.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.340]   They have this team that puts stuff out on all these channels.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.180]   I don't think he knows how any of that stuff actually works.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   I don't think he cares.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.100]   I don't use social media.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.740]   I don't have enough cycles for that to lay claim to my life.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.140]   But there's a less obvious harm as well if you have a lot of these highly addictive digital
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.500]   distractions in your life.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.660]   It's not just that the content distracts you.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:45.300]   It's that the tools trick the people producing things into thinking the tools are productive
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.180]   things to do.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.940]   So if you're in, especially in some sort of creative field, these tools have this insidious
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.540]   way of convincing you that spending time on them is actually part of what you need to
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.380]   be doing to build up your really good skill, to get an audience, to get noticed.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   It tricks you.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.820]   You say, "Look, I'm not just being distracted.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.260]   I'm on here like posting and engaging because this is a key part of me being someone doing
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.820]   something creative."
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.380]   That is you just being tricked by these companies.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.580]   It's just a great way to get a lot more of your attention to convince you that that one
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.220]   or two hours per day you spend working on these platforms, they want you to think that's
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.140]   productive because it's fun.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.460]   It's a simulation of actual hard creative work.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.460]   It's like going to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland instead of going to the
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.120]   actual Caribbean.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:40.220]   It kind of feels like you've gone to the Bahamas, but in reality, you're in a blacked out warehouse
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.980]   in Orlando.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.660]   That's what happens when creators get sucked into the social media world.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.860]   It tricks you into thinking you're doing work.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.500]   And it's the best, most fun work you've ever done because it doesn't require much of you
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   to concentrate.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.680]   It's interesting.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.020]   It's pressing all these buttons.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.060]   It's low friction.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.060]   It's high energy.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060]   And you can check things off.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.900]   I'm maximizing my account, and I'm doing these Twitter threads that people told me I need
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.180]   to do where the very last tweet in the thread says, "Thanks for listening.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.940]   If you like these type of things, please subscribe."
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.060]   And I took some course online that said, "This is how I'm going to build up an audience."
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.300]   And I'm going to do these stupid articles on Medium.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.220]   They're like 400 words, and I'm convinced that it feels good because it's easy, and
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.320]   you can check it off, and it exposes you to all these distractions.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   The robotic pirates are funny, but it's not the same as being on the beach on Eleuthera.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:39.440]   So you've got to be careful, especially if you're trying to do something interesting,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.120]   that you've got to hold these digital distractions at bay to use them all the time.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.600]   You're not being savvy.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.120]   You're clocking into a factory that's owned by Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.620]   You're clocking into the factory to do your shift, and they're not sending you a paycheck.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.680]   All right, so those are my three rules.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.320]   To get notably good at something that can help you unlock the deep life, you have to
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.540]   follow the 10-year rule.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.300]   It's going to take a while, but use that to your advantage.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.720]   During that time, you need to expand, explore, and exploit, and that is going to require
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.840]   that you significantly reform your relationship with digital distractions.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.880]   Here's the good news about that last piece, by the way.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.160]   If you're thinking to yourself, "Man, I'm going to have a really hard time.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   I do all this stuff on my phone.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.340]   I'm going to have a really hard time not doing this," you know what makes that a lot easier?
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.040]   To be getting after something you care about.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.760]   The people who are locked in, doing something like, "I'm starting to get some traction here.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   I'm exploring.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.880]   I'm shipping things.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.360]   I can feel myself getting better.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   I'm being deliberate about it."
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.400]   They have a pretty easy time not spending all day on Instagram because they have something
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.960]   else capturing their attention that seems even more rewarding.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.040]   So that final rule won't be as hard as you think once you actually get going.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.800]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   I like it.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   Good.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   10-year rule.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.560]   That means we have six more years until this podcast gets good.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.080]   We're about four and a half years in.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   We're getting there.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   We're getting there.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.960]   Though we do a lot of podcasts, so maybe we'll have a bit of the Michael Crichton effect
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.120]   where we're kind of compressing work, so maybe like five or six years.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   Extend the lease on the HQ.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   I know.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   We're getting new desks.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.740]   I mean, we'll have to extend the lease.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   We are.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   We are.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   It's very exciting.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.720]   We're going to have the Maker Lab portion of the HQ also where we do our editing bay.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.120]   Big substantial, big wood desks.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.120]   So yeah, we got it.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   Now we got to make this succeed.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.640]   If this doesn't succeed now, we're going to be stuck with a lot of desks.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   All right.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   So we've got some cool questions that just cover a lot of these topics, time management,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.040]   career, like a lot of stuff just around trying to like succeed.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   Cool stuff.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.520]   But first, let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.580]   So I talk about a relatively new sponsor that I'm pretty excited about, and that is our
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.380]   friends at Factor.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.380]   These are fantastic.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.820]   I love this product.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.820]   Factor provides you.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.820]   They ship right to your house.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.120]   These no prep, no mess meals.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.380]   These are chef, chef, chef, I can't say, I'm saying chef.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.860]   This is how you know it's Friday afternoon, folks.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.020]   Chef crafted meals.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.300]   And they come from, they have these different options.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.740]   So like whatever your wellness goals are, you just choose the option you care about.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.140]   So like if you're trying to do weight loss, there's calorie smart.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.060]   They're like constrained calories, but they have protein plus.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.940]   If you're doing like a keto, they have keto.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.740]   And the thing about these meals is they get delivered to your door.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.180]   They're refrigerated, not frozen.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.180]   They're fresh.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.180]   Right.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.600]   And you just cook them in the microwave.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.480]   So it's like two minutes in the microwave, boom, and you've got this fresh meal.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   It just makes it so simple.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.900]   Like whatever the goal you're going for, you can just get the meals from that category,
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.340]   get them shipped to your house, not even think about it.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.300]   They have 35 different meals with more than 60 add-ons to choose from every week.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.200]   So you'll always have new flavors to explore.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.420]   I have now tried five different of the meals.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.260]   I enjoyed all five.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.660]   I use them all for lunch.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.640]   We've talked about this on the show before.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.500]   Like my approach to nutrition is automate breakfast and lunch, do interesting stuff
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   with dinner.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.260]   But I always either have no breakfast, just coffee or the same breakfast that's going
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.500]   to be two eggs and one piece of Ezekiel toast if I'm hungry.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.660]   And I don't want to think about lunch.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.260]   I want it to fuel me and solve whatever nutrition goal I have.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.900]   So factor is now, it's a great way to do that because a factor meal now, it couldn't be
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   more automated.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.900]   Boom.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.900]   Microwave.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   Boom.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.900]   Food.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.900]   Eat it.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.900]   It's great.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.900]   Tastes better than what I would whip up and takes no time to do.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.900]   And there you go.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   All right.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.700]   So we've covered a lot of meals here from breakfast to dessert.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.060]   I mean, they have a lot of options here.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.220]   It's really restaurant quality.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.220]   I agree with that.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.220]   I've tried five of these.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.500]   They are, we're talking about filet mignon, shrimp, blackened salmon, like it's good food.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.860]   Kitchen time is to a minimum, it's about two minutes.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.540]   I mean, I have a terrible microwave, Jesse.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.300]   So it takes me a little bit more.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.420]   We have like a small, I don't know why.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.740]   We have a small microwave.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   Really?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.740]   For whatever reason.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.700]   I think we just bought on Amazon when one broke and it was like, oh, this much smaller
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.700]   than we thought.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.360]   I mean, our microwave is basically, I think it's like, there's like a squirrel, like rubbing
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.340]   sticks together in there to create a little bit of heat.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.340]   So like everything takes much longer than it should.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.260]   But if you have a normal microwave, two minutes should be enough.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:26.100]   So head to factormeals.com/deep50 and use the promo code DEEP50 to get 50% off your

[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.980]   Also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.860]   You need to be using a VPN to be using your computer without a VPN is like leaving your
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.140]   laptop out at the coffee shop when you go to go to the bathroom.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.520]   Like it will be fine often.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.020]   You do this enough, it's going to get snagged.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   Well, same thing.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.220]   If you're connecting to the internet, especially in public without a VPN, you are just opening
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:17.420]   yourself up to having your information stolen or your machine being hacked.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.660]   Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, cafes, hotels, airports, et cetera, your online
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.940]   data is not secure.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.700]   Anyone on the same network can gain access to your personal data.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.300]   It doesn't even take a lot of knowledge.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:35.380]   You don't have to be like one of these losers that goes to MIT to, I don't know why you
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.380]   trust anyone from MIT.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.260]   You don't need to be one of them.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.100]   You could just buy this cheap hardware, you plug into a laptop, there's scripts.
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.220]   It's like really easy for people to steal your data.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.980]   And look, there's a reason they want to do it too.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.980]   You can get up to $1,000 on the black market for the data these hackers steal.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.740]   If you have ExpressVPN, they can't do it.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.520]   If you have ExpressVPN, what happens is your data gets encrypted on your machine and on
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.420]   breakable code.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.000]   Your traffic gets sent to a VPN server, which unencrypts it and then talks to the site and
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.620]   service that you're trying to communicate to on your behalf, encrypts the result, sends
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.860]   it back to you, and then your computer unencrypts it.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.720]   So the people who are nearby you in the coffee shop, all they can see is you have encrypted
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.140]   traffic to a VPN server.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.380]   They learn nothing about you.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.860]   They cannot get your information.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.820]   Why I like ExpressVPN is that it's easy to use, right?
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.640]   You fire up the app, you click a button, it's on, and you just use everything like normal.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   Real easy to set up.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.400]   It could be on your phone, it can be on your laptop, it can be on your tablet.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.240]   It's rated number one by top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.880]   You need a VPN, and ExpressVPN is what I recommend.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.760]   So secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:54.500]   That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-p-n.com/deep, and you will get an extra three months free, but only
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.420]   when you go to expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.220]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.680]   Who do we have first?
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.220]   First question is from Pete.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.780]   I've watched your time management video a hundred times on YouTube.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.940]   For whatever reason, I can't make it stick.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.860]   It just feels like I have this insurmountable backlog of stuff that is forever in my inbox.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.580]   Running beyond a single day feels impossible.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.100]   Why can't I succeed with your time management system?
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:24.940]   It'd be funny if we looked up our time management video and it had like 105 views.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.100]   It's just all Pete.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.740]   And there's like 20 comments all from Pete.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.140]   That would be depressing.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.420]   Actually, your time management video is pretty popular.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.180]   Yeah, it's very popular.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.180]   It's a great video.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.180]   All right.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.180]   Well, Pete, I appreciate the question.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.180]   A couple things here.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:45.380]   Okay, so first of all, let me start philosophically, then we'll get tactically.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.380]   Okay.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:51.420]   Philosophically, when you say you have a hard time planning beyond a single day, I'm not
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.180]   quite sure what this means, right?
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.260]   So my system does not necessarily have you building detailed plans for multiple days
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.820]   in the future.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.060]   You'll build a plan for the current day.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.300]   You'll time block plan, make the most of the time you have available that day.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.700]   You might have a weekly plan, but a weekly plan probably does not mean you're making
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.420]   detailed plans for your week.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.980]   It's you're checking in on your week.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.020]   What days are open?
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.020]   What days aren't?
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.900]   Do I need to move anything?
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.620]   Your weekly plan is where you might be.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.200]   You're looking at your quarterly goals.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   You might say, "You know what?
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.300]   I want to make time this week to make progress on some bigger non-urgent goal I have."
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.340]   And maybe you schedule some time on your calendar for that.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.520]   But this idea that you're doing a lot of detailed planning to the future is not necessarily
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.660]   something that you need to be doing with my system.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:41.460]   The thing that I think might be affecting you here is that you don't have a good capture
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.460]   board.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.740]   When you say stuff is forever in your inbox, I'm suspecting what you might be trying to
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.820]   do is just answer all and do all the stuff in your inbox.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.340]   Like once I handle the thing in this message, I take it out of my inbox.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.140]   In most knowledge work jobs, that's going to be impossible.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.820]   It's going to be impossible to keep up.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.160]   Your inbox is just going to grow longer and longer.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.260]   So I want you to get your obligations out of your inbox and into some sort of capture
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.940]   system.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.660]   And the one I recommend is using these sort of role-based status boards.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:18.540]   So you should have a different status board for each of your professional roles.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.020]   So if you have multiple hats you wear in your job, have a separate board for each.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.740]   I use Trello, but you could do this in another tool.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.700]   You can also do this in a shared document.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.900]   You could do this with a stack of index cards in your desk if you wanted to.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.260]   I'm sort of tool agnostic here.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:38.540]   For each role, you have a column or a stack for the different statuses of things you need
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.540]   to do.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.060]   So this could be like backlog, like non-urgent, but stuff I might need to get to.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.020]   You can have a stack here that is working on this week.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.140]   You can and should have a stack that says waiting to hear back.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.020]   It's a critical one.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.420]   I sent a message to this person.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.980]   I'm waiting to hear back.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.820]   When I hear back, here's what I have to do next.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.940]   You need that to exist somewhere.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.300]   It should exist in your waiting to hear back stack.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.980]   If you have regular meetings with people at your organization, have a stack for things
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.460]   to discuss at the next meeting with that person.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.780]   I'm the director of undergraduate studies for Georgetown Computer Science this year.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.820]   I have one of those stacks for my associate DUS for our weekly meetings, and I have a
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.580]   stack for our department chair that we have monthly meetings.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.840]   So I put stuff on there to remember to discuss it at our next meeting.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.300]   You want to get everything into these boards.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.340]   So you don't have to do the things in your inbox, but you do got to process them out
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.420]   of your inbox into one of these status-based boards.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.660]   Now you don't have the problem of, I can't keep my inboxes overflowing.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.140]   I'll never get to everything in my inbox.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.300]   When people say, I'm just going to have to declare email bankruptcy, I say, oh, you don't
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.320]   have a capture system.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.140]   Your capture system is your inbox.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.340]   And the thing is, so many things that show up, if you look at your status boards, especially
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.060]   these like backlog or things to get to one day, those things grow really wrong, right?
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.600]   You don't empty these boards out.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.540]   Like the stuff that you actually need to be working on is relatively small compared to
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.580]   the full amount of stuff that comes in.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.720]   So if you're just storing your task in your inbox, that thing is going to grow.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.020]   It's going to continue to grow.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.420]   So you got to get into these status boards.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.780]   Now because they're role-based, so you have a different board for each different role,
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.940]   this allows you now to avoid higher level context shifts.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.220]   You can say, okay, here's one of my roles is like I'm in charge of the hiring committee
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.220]   at my company.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:34.340]   And I have a board that just has the tasks for that and that's piled by their statuses.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.620]   When I'm working on hiring committee stuff, I just see hiring committee stuff.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.740]   My mindset is in hiring.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.380]   I've given myself two and a half hours to work on hiring committee stuff.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.780]   All I'm doing is looking at the task on this board and my mind is in it.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.020]   And you will find after like 10 or 15 minutes, you're able to make progress through these
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.380]   things much faster.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.020]   And then maybe after lunch, you're like, I'm working on my other role as like a copywriter.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.060]   And now I go to that board and my mind is only focused on doing copywriter stuff.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.260]   And it could be a long deep work session or I could be churning through tasks, but they're
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.180]   all related to the same role.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.760]   That makes it much easier.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.380]   If you instead just have all this stuff mixed together in your inbox, and it's an archive
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.220]   that's growing longer and it's mixing urgent stuff with non-urgent stuff and backlog stuff
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.900]   with stuff that maybe you're waiting to hear back from someone, and you're trying to go
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.140]   message by message, you're shifting from role to role, task by task, and your brain just
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.740]   says enough, and you get exhausted.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:31.020]   The final advantage of having these task boards is that over time, you'd appreciate stuff
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.060]   out of there.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.700]   Stuff you put onto these like backlogs.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.340]   I often also have a stack called to process where I don't even know how to turn this into
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.340]   a task yet.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.660]   So let me just put this here as a stake in the ground so I don't forget it.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.820]   But I might just say something pretty vague, like new website.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.940]   This was come up in a meeting, I don't even know what this means, but let me just not
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.100]   forget this, I'll put it over here.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.180]   Over time, you're going to take stuff off this.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.380]   You're like, you know what, this has sat here forever, no one has brought it up again, I'm
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.140]   taking this off.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.540]   This thing over here.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.540]   I'm going to write the person involved.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.380]   Like, look, I know we talked about this.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.500]   I really don't have cycles for this right now.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.660]   It doesn't seem too urgent unless, and this is a key terminology, unless I hear otherwise
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.860]   from you, I'm just going to put this on hold for now.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.500]   And when people hear, unless I hear otherwise, they say, great, I don't have to reply.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.060]   And so you get to take these things off, right?
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.040]   So it's the other thing, it allows you to sort of over time, clear stuff out of your
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.760]   obligations in a really systematic way.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.060]   This doesn't happen when everything just exists in your inbox.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.020]   It just grows and it grows.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.160]   And then you feel like you have to declare email bankruptcy and just delete everything.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:45.180]   But the problem is, in that stack of 1600 emails is probably like 200 that you probably
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.200]   do need to keep track of, and you probably still need to have that information somewhere.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.100]   So it's a really stressful situation.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.860]   So get your inbox empty, not by doing everything, but by getting things into these role-based
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.100]   status boards.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.340]   It really makes a big difference.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.900]   I mean, I really, I really have to push people towards that.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.900]   It really makes a big difference.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.820]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.500]   Next question is from Matthew.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.540]   I'm an electrical engineer and I'm able to work from home a lot.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.340]   The phone foyer method is effective, but I still enjoy staying up to date on things like
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.740]   my Substack, YouTube feed, and other distraction machines.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.940]   I'm looking for ways to effectively slow down the consumption of this content, especially
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.780]   using RSS aggregators to facilitate the way content is delivered.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.140]   All right, well, Matthew, I tend to care more about the how you consume content than the
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.380]   when, right?
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.260]   So a couple of things I would suggest here.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.980]   Let's tackle these distractions category by category.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   I like newsletters.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.500]   I think email newsletters are great.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:48.460]   You can effectively create a custom magazine for yourself of just writers you like, just
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.820]   writing about stuff you care about.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.180]   That's the way I think about newsletters.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:57.020]   You need to see yourself now, like, okay, these aren't email correspondence.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.220]   I am an editor and these are my writers.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.300]   And they're sending me these pieces that I'm going to put together into an awesome issue
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.260]   of a magazine that I'm then going to sit down at some point and read.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.060]   So collect all of your Substacks or other email newsletters you subscribe to, collect
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.740]   them in a folder or a Gmail label, and then semi-regularly, you want to get these out
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.980]   of your inbox into another form to sort of read all at once.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.280]   Again, use the magazine metaphor.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.800]   One of the cool tools I like that's out there right now is called Newsletters, the Kindle.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.140]   You can Google that and you can find it.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.300]   It makes it easy for you to take these email newsletters and to get them onto your Kindle.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.860]   Now what you can do is like have a set time.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.860]   All right, what I do is on like Friday mornings or something.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.980]   I go through my folders, I send all the interesting looking emails to my Kindle and I go to a
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.020]   coffee shop and I take an hour and I have some coffee and I get a cinnamon roll and
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.420]   I'm reading these newsletters with zero distraction on my Kindle and it's great.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.300]   And it's like this awesome magazine that I wish existed in the nineties and now I have
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.820]   it and it takes me an hour to read.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.340]   It's not some, I'm not engaging with these newsletters exactly as they arrive and just
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.620]   seeing it as like part of like my flow of my work.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.620]   It's a magazine and I don't read magazines in the middle of my work day and I'm not going
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.860]   to read these newsletters in the middle of my work day.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:16.460]   When it comes to something like YouTube, I think video is the future of independent generated
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.460]   media.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.460]   I've said this before.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:24.140]   I'm also very suspicious of algorithmic recommendations and the idea of using YouTube as a distraction
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.140]   machine.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.100]   So let's be really careful about how we use YouTube.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   Have the channels you like, treat them like shows like you would again, 20 years ago,
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.060]   like shows you like watching, right?
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:45.520]   In like 2006 there would be shows you liked watching and you would TiVo them, right?
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520]   Whatever it is.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.740]   I like to watch the office on NBC.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.940]   I want to watch the amazing race.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.340]   I'm trying to think of shows that were around there.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:40:01.020]   There was a show in 2005 or six that was called kid's town on Fox or it was, there's like
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.620]   a town, it was like a kind of like an old west town and they put a bunch of kids in
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.700]   it and said, okay, you guys got to just like run this town by yourself and it was like
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:16.740]   the kids had to just run the town and I guess there's camera people there.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.060]   But it was like, okay, that's a great idea.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:22.340]   But anyways, you would TiVo your shows, PBS shows, whatever.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.820]   And then like you would have times you sit down to watch like, yeah, we're going to make
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.900]   dinner on a Thursday night.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.100]   We're going to watch kids town and amazing race, right?
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.780]   That's the way you should think about YouTube.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.540]   And I would use bookmarks even, right?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.740]   I mean, I would even like bookmark the channels I like.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.660]   So you bookmark my channel.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.940]   You bookmark the like hardcore kids town fans for 20 years, been trying to bring that show
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.940]   back.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   Whatever, right?
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   Bookmark these things.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.300]   And in fact, you should learn, like, I kind of know when the new episodes come out, like,
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.100]   you know, Cal episodes come out on Mondays or whatever.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.380]   And then you can have like appointment viewing, like on your iPad, instead of watching TV,
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.260]   I'm going to sit down and watch like the latest episode of XYZ or I'm going to load the YouTube
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.380]   app on my TV and I'm going to watch it on my TV while I eat dinner.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.660]   Treat YouTube like you would TV in 2006.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.660]   That's fine.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.860]   What you shouldn't do is say in the middle of the workday, I'm going to open up YouTube
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:13.320]   and I'm just going to rock and roll down those recommendation letters, right?
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:19.060]   Because you start with kids town clips and then, you know, 20 minutes later, you're either
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:24.340]   in unboxing videos or you're like watching people's videos about like we should imprison
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.740]   kids in towns.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.460]   And they're like trying to make a case for like, we basically should, you know, whatever.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.620]   So that's the way I would suggest doing YouTube.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.740]   So you just have to have care about how you do these things.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.020]   In my book, Digital Minimalism, I said, look, if it comes to a social platform, if there's
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   a specific value you get out of it, and there are specific values you can get, have rules
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   around it.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.740]   I talked about artists, for example, reducing their Instagram feeds to just other visual
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.740]   artists.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.520]   And on Friday nights, they sit down with like a glass of wine and they look at the art they
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.700]   posted and they get inspiration and that's valuable.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.240]   And that's the only time they mess around with that app the whole week.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.340]   Another important use for YouTube for some people is exposure to positive portrayals
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.220]   of a goal they're pursuing.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:12.720]   So you're getting really into rowing, like, okay, I want to follow some of these rowing
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:18.060]   feeds because it's like seeing the workouts and the success of these rowers like motivates
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.060]   you.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.060]   That's great.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.300]   Like make that your feed, have a set time you look at it.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.860]   Ten minutes before my workout, I'd look at these videos.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:31.000]   So you got to understand the value you're getting out of these things, put smart walls
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.920]   around it that preserves the value and gets rid of everything else.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.080]   And they're no longer distraction machines.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.680]   They're just one of other sources of sort of like valuable, interesting information.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.560]   Like that's how you have to navigate the world of information.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.480]   And if you time block your workday, then you really don't have to worry about this stuff
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.000]   intruding on your workday, because unless you put down a time block for, you know, mess
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.760]   around on the internet, you're not going to do it.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.360]   You know, if you really want to end your day early, if you need to, and put aside 90 minutes
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   to mess around the internet, but time blocking will keep this out of your workday, but put
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.320]   walls around it, put fences around it.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.840]   All right, who do we got?
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.920]   Next question is from Giacomo.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:14.080]   As a UX designer, I find it to be cognitively demanding to emphasize with and persuade others.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.600]   Is preparing for and attending reviews about my designs deep work?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.240]   Yeah, there's nothing about deep work that demands it be solitary.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.960]   It's one of the big misconceptions.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.040]   I tried to dispel it in the book, Deep Work, I call it the whiteboard effect.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.800]   I talked about the advantages of doing deep work with other people.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.600]   It's not by definition, a solitary activity.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:43.120]   The things that define it, if we go back to the original definition, cognitively demanding,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.480]   and you're doing it with no distraction.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:50.200]   So it requires you to concentrate, and you're not context switching.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.240]   If you're context switching, you're looking at email, you're looking at your phone back,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   it's not deep work.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.100]   It could be cognitively demanding, but it's not deep work.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.280]   If you're giving it your full attention, but it's filling out forms, that's not cognitively
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.000]   demanding, that's also not deep work.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.480]   So there's nothing about being in front of an audience, for example, that makes it not
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   deep work.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.960]   So yes, if you're pitching to an audience, and it's requiring you to empathize and try
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.440]   to understand what people are saying, and integrate that information real time to try
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.960]   to adjust your pitch or update your ideas on the fly, that's deep work.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.920]   I consider, for example, if I'm teaching or lecturing, that's deep work.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.080]   I'm in front of an audience, I'm trying to synthesize complicated information, I see
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.760]   that as being deep work.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:38.680]   Yesterday, I spoke on a panel with a bunch of digital legal experts, that's deep work.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.840]   I had to be thinking about what they were saying, I had to adjust my stuff to fit into
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:46.120]   the context, I had to respond to the questions, we're in a room with 100 people, that's as
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.560]   much of deep work as when I'm sitting alone with a computer.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.920]   So I think it is good to think about anything that's cognitively demanding that's getting
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.400]   your full focus, like that is deep work, and deep work is important.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.840]   So yeah, what you're doing is deep work, even when there's other people around.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.680]   All right, what do we got?
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   We got from Lindsey, "My son has just entered high school, my goal is to help him think
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.520]   through the kind of lifestyle he would want in the future, rather than simply encourage
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.120]   him toward arbitrary college and career goals.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.320]   I want to ensure that his academic and career choices are intentional and aligned with his
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.960]   personal values and interests."
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.040]   All right, so I'm going to give you book recommendations.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.920]   Right now, with your son in high school, I'm going to recommend that you both take a look
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.760]   at my book, How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:39.560]   This follows a collection of high school students from the early 2000s, who got accepted to
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:45.220]   good colleges, but had interesting, non-stressed high school careers.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:49.600]   The terminology I use in the book is I call them relaxed superstars.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.260]   And I deconstruct how did they do it, right?
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.280]   In particular, there's a chapter in here on what I call "interestingness".
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.560]   How is a high school student to become an interesting person, and why this is like a
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:08.020]   much more important goal than becoming a highly "accomplished" person, why this is a more
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:13.640]   important goal than having the most crowded possible resume, that there is a huge power
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.920]   to becoming interesting.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.360]   And this is something that you can systematically cultivate.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.840]   I give ideas for how to do that.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.400]   So in high school, that's what I would look at, this relaxed superstar model.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.440]   It's a great preparation for what's going to come next.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.580]   Once you're in college, I would then recommend that your son read my book, So Good They Can't
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.580]   Ignore You.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:39.660]   And this is going to change the way that they think about the career world, and it's going
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:45.040]   to push them away from this idea of like, you got to choose the right job right now,
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.800]   and there is a right job, and it's about matching that job to you.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   It's about following your passion or finding the job that you were meant to do.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.840]   And if you get that wrong, you'll be miserable.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.080]   And it changes that and says, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.600]   Your working life is a part of your bigger life, and you cultivate it to be good for
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.160]   you and interesting and resonant.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.580]   And how do you cultivate it?
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.840]   You build up what I call career capital, which you build up by becoming good at things that
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   are valuable.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.080]   And as you become good at things that are valuable, you get more control over your career
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.600]   and you can shape this into something cool.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.720]   Whatever cool means to you, and it can mean a lot of different things.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.240]   So interestingness in high school, so you avoid getting caught in the trap of just more
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.520]   is better, professionalizing yourself at too young of an age, and then career capital training
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.280]   in college.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.620]   Those two things together, A, your son is going to enjoy and find life interesting in
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.620]   high school.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:37.540]   He's going to enjoy and find life interesting in college, not going to be in this grinding
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.520]   mindset of sacrifice now for some unspecified future later.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.940]   He's also going to be able to craft a really cool life in college and beyond.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.060]   So I care a lot about those issues.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.060]   I wrote those two books.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   I recommend them.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.060]   All right.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.620]   What do we have, Jesse?
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   We have our corner.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.060]   Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:05.220]   Let's hear that theme music.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:10.400]   So every episode, we like to have one question that connects to my most recent book, Slow
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.020]   Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.900]   If you have not read the book, you should.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.380]   It's sort of like a cheat sheet for so many of the ideas we talk about on the show.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.100]   You can find Slow Productivity anywhere books are sold, including an audio version, which
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.100]   I recorded.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.740]   So you can hear the dulcet tones of Cal Newport.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:35.660]   The Slow Productivity theme music, interesting fact, plays nonstop during the audio book.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.480]   Six hours of just that theme music.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.980]   We recorded it with a live band.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.300]   So for six hours, we had a live band.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.020]   There's like a guy on a guitar doing arpeggios and someone doing ... I'm going to demand
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   that for my next book.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.020]   All right.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   Enough nonsense.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.520]   Let's hear the Slow Productivity Corner question this week.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.520]   All right.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.520]   It's from Jonathan.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.220]   I've been getting close to launching a new business.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:00.700]   I've been reading Slow Productivity and applying your lessons to get rid of every extraneous
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.460]   project and minimize time suck when possible, but I still find it difficult to give each
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.740]   endeavor the intention it deserves to grow.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.300]   How do I find time?
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.660]   Well, Jonathan, what you got to do here is like we sometimes use this phrase on the show,
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.420]   you have to face the productivity dragon.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:22.180]   Now face the productivity dragon is deep question speak for confronting the reality of how long
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:27.140]   things you want to do take and how much time you actually have.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:33.940]   We often write fairy tales where we can just go get the proverbial gold and we don't realize
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.140]   that there's an actual dragon there.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.640]   So be really clear, like what needs to be done for this business to launch successfully?
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.380]   How hard is it to do those things?
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.940]   How much time and energy is required?
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.780]   You might find the answer is this is going to take a lot of time.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.220]   There's more here than I thought.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.780]   There might be some of these things are going to be sort of ambiguously long.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.660]   Like I have to find a partner to do this.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:02.420]   And what I'm going to recommend from a Slow Productivity perspective is to say, that's
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.420]   cool.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.380]   It's going to take longer, right?
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:13.420]   The Slow Productivity mindset is if you're willing to relentlessly stick to something,
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.940]   you can make its footprint in your life reasonable and sustainable.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:23.500]   You can trust what we call the compounding interest of accomplishment, that if I stick
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.300]   with it, let me do this thing, then this thing, and it's going to take me a month.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.420]   And this is at the time I have free, this might take me a couple of weeks and it might
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.500]   be four months to get this done.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:36.780]   As long as you don't stop and you keep making deliberate progress, intentional progress,
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.460]   not just going through the motions, but intentional progress, it's okay to say this might take
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   two years.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.900]   I'm going to aggregate up the, again, the compound interest of accomplishment.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.780]   I'm going to aggregate up these steps and this is going to lead to this and lead to
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:48.780]   this.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.460]   And it might be two years later and now I'm ready to pull the trigger and it's not at
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.740]   all risky or weird.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.780]   Everything's in place.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:54.780]   All the pieces are here.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.020]   I have my first clients.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.060]   We've done these test things.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.900]   We have a fallback option.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.940]   And if you do this right, when you flip the switch to like switch over to the new company,
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.900]   it's not even stressful.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.860]   A Slow Productivity mindset says it's okay if this stuff takes time.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.700]   In fact, many accomplishments that you see that are very impressive took people a really
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.140]   long amount of time.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.700]   I do these stories again and again in Slow Productivity, the book, "Hey, you know this
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:27.340]   famous thing from history, Newton's Principia, Galileo figuring out the laws of pendulum
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.340]   motion.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.120]   It took decades.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.580]   They worked on it regularly.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.460]   They didn't give up, but they weren't burning the midnight oil.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.660]   They weren't going in some sort of frenzy.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.300]   They just let the compound interest of accomplishment accrue.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.660]   And over time they produced these things which are awesome and we remember them for that.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.780]   And we have no idea how long it took.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.860]   The issue is our culture right now, especially the internet culture, and a lot of this again
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:54.820]   is shaped by this fool's goal that the social media and influencer community puts out there
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.540]   to try to get more engagement.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:03.100]   This culture gives you this idea that inspiration plus the ability, the willingness to just
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.780]   like get after it and be frenzied for a few days is like how stuff happens.
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.820]   That you're like, "I'm going to make this YouTube channel work," and you just sort of
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.580]   like get after it and record these cool things crazy.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:17.060]   You're like Mr. Beast for a week and then it just works.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.700]   That like I have these pithy things I'm sending on Twitter and then I'm just like a famous
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.740]   influencer, right?
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.980]   That's not how most useful stuff happens.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   It takes time.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.820]   So Slow Productivity is about that's fine.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.180]   That's the slow piece of it.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.180]   Be fine.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.320]   Life is long.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.740]   Life is long.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.340]   Enjoy the day, right?
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.540]   You want to enjoy each day and you want over the years to have done stuff that's pretty
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.540]   cool.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.700]   So maybe this is just a matter, Jonathan, of just being okay once you face the productivity
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.020]   dragon and be like, "It's going to take a lot longer than I thought," but that's not
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.020]   a bad thing.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:50.540]   It's not a bad thing because I'm making progress on it every day, but each of these days is
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.540]   sustainable.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.040]   So just got to slow down.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:53:02.940]   Let's hear that music one more time, Jesse.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.940]   All right.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:04.940]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.940]   We do.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   Oh, let's hear this.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   Hey, ETL.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.280]   My name is Brom and I'm from Maryland.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.460]   So I have a nonfiction book idea that I'm working on.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:21.080]   So far, I've only written one chapter that captures the core of the idea.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.180]   I also don't have social media or a blog.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:31.520]   What would you recommend as a way to test the demand or to see if it's useful to people
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.720]   before actually writing the full thing?
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   Thanks.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   All right.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.960]   Well, I got two pieces of advice here.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.800]   One is just tactical book writing advice, and then the second is specific to your question
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.120]   about social media or blogs and writing careers.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.140]   My tactical piece of advice, stop writing the book.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.520]   That's not how nonfiction works.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.040]   You do not write the book in advance.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.280]   Having written the book in advance is a big negative hit against you.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:04.420]   In nonfiction, you sign an agent based on the potential of the idea and the potential
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.740]   of you as a writer.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:09.680]   The agent helps you write a proposal, which you then sell to a publishing house.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.920]   The publishing house then gives you an advance for the book, and then you go write it.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.200]   The editors want to be involved in shaping the ideas.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.320]   Your agent is going to want to be involved in shaping your ideas.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.120]   Do not try to get around this system.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.720]   Everyone has like, "Well, I'm going to get around it by writing my book, and I'm going
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   to do this and that.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.120]   I'm going to make an in run around the system."
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.320]   The system works.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.360]   Everyone's desperate for good stuff to publish.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.520]   No one is trying to hold you out of this system, but it's also a really good checkpoint.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:44.040]   You don't have to do that much work to approach an agent, but your idea plus you gets a really
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.240]   good early screening.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   You've got to convince an agent.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.120]   If an agent is convinced, then they have to convince a publisher, so you've got to follow
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   the real process.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:57.320]   I wrote a blog post about this a long time ago, I think just two books into my publishing
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   career.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.720]   I wrote this blog post at calnewport.com.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   You can find it with Google.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   Google calnewport.com, and I think it's called "How to Get a Nonfiction Book Deal."
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.640]   I go through, "Here is how this world works.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.160]   Don't write your own rules.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.920]   Follow the real rules of the world.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.440]   If you're afraid to follow the real rules of the world because you think you're going
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.920]   to get rejected early on, that's useful feedback."
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.000]   Good.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.840]   How do we make sure you don't get rejected?
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.400]   It gives you feedback right away of, "How do I actually make this idea ready to go?"
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   All right.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.080]   Now going to the role of social media and blogs.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.400]   Here's something to remember.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.960]   There has been a nonfiction publishing industry in this country for a long time.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:42.800]   I'm reading a Thoreau biography right now, for example, mid-19th century.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.720]   He is selling Walden to Tickner, right?
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   There's companies.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.720]   They were based in Boston.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.620]   This was big business for at least 200 years.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:02.080]   Social media, blogs, as a widespread use thing, is about 12 years old.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.660]   Just ask yourself this question.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.440]   How did all of the tens of thousands of nonfiction writers who existed before 12 years ago, how
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.840]   were they able to come up with ideas and sell books?
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.160]   There's your answer, right?
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:20.080]   I do not buy the premise that in the last 12 years, the way we did this for 150 years
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.400]   now no longer works and the only way to sell a nonfiction book is to have an online platform
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.720]   or to test ideas out on platforms.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.240]   People have been doing this for a very long time.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   What you're looking for, if we want to be more specific, and this is in my blog post,
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.840]   so find it.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.080]   If you're a nonfiction, and it's pragmatic nonfiction, not journalistic nonfiction, but
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.920]   like, here's a book about an idea, a book about advice.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.800]   This is where non-journalist authors can write.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.440]   It's got to be an idea that people are going to feel like they have to read, and you have
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.720]   to be the right person to write it.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.280]   You get those two things together, and you can prove that you're a not bad writer.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.800]   You don't have to be a good writer, but you have to be a not bad writer.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   It can't be embarrassing.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.160]   Then you've got a shot of selling that book.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.260]   You don't need to test run this on social media.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.400]   You don't need to have a blog, necessarily.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.280]   You just have to be thinking.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   I read a lot.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   I know the industry.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.320]   I feel strongly about this idea.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.040]   I think it is an idea that is hitting my gut, as that people will see that on a shelf and
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.640]   say, "I have to read it, and I'm the right person to write about it."
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.360]   That's what it takes.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.240]   That's how I came up with my first books.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.720]   I didn't have a platform or this or that.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.480]   I think about ideas, and what works and what doesn't, and I trust my gut, and I see what's
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.040]   happening in the market.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   Don't get distracted.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:39.060]   If you want to be a writer, don't get distracted by the platform right now.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:43.900]   We talked about this back in the deep dive, where I said the meanest trick that these
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.940]   online distraction platforms ever played was figuring out how to convince potential creators
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.180]   that these platforms were necessary.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.300]   It's like tricking a professional endurance athlete into thinking that the key to their
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.160]   success is going to involve smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.060]   It's actively making them worse at what they do.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.060]   That is what happens.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.180]   That's what these platforms do so well.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:13.300]   They want to steal this energy you have towards doing something really meaningful, like writing
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.280]   a book that might affect thousands of people.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:23.180]   They want to steal that energy into you doing these sort of ephemeral fake activities that
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:28.420]   they've created for you, to go into their warehouse and to seem like you're being productive,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.020]   which they can just monetize.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   It's like a shame.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.020]   It's like a tragedy.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.340]   Don't let them steal your energy.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.020]   Polish your idea.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.220]   Find an idea that you're the right person to write.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.620]   If you're not a not-bad writer, become a not-bad writer, which means you have to go out there
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.240]   and find places where you can write.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.020]   You have to find magazines, online magazines, newsletters, whatever it is that people let
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.020]   you write for.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.020]   You've got to be a good enough writer.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.020]   All this is hard work.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.020]   That's fine.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.580]   We talked about the 10-year rule during the deep dive.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.580]   That's fine.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:58.060]   It took me 10 years to write my first really good book.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.060]   That's fine.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   Be willing to do the work.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   Get the idea.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.060]   Be the right one to do it.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.060]   Learn how to write.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.340]   Pitch the right way to agents.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.340]   Don't write your own path.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.620]   That's how this all works.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:13.180]   Don't let Instagram or TikTok or Elon Musk's Twitter steal that energy from you.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.940]   They have enough money.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.900]   I was looking at the richest persons, the top 10 in the world list earlier today.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.580]   Musk is number one right now.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.780]   Zuckerberg is like number five.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.040]   They have enough money.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.860]   You don't need to monetize your time on their behalf right now.
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:33.140]   You need to focus on your idea, learning how to write, figuring out the idea where you're
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.900]   the right person to write it.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:39.540]   Go read that post, CalNewport.com and how to get a nonfiction book deal.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:43.900]   If you Google something like that, you'll find it and then get after it.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.740]   Let those guys have their stocks high enough.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.300]   They don't need your help.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:52.900]   With all the literary agents you know, do they get pitched a lot by potential?
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.460]   They do, but not enough.
[00:59:55.460 --> 01:00:01.140]   To me it's just the oddest thing that if you want to be a writer, why not figure out how
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.020]   does the world of writing work?
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:08.140]   Everyone wants to write their own story to that, their own answer to that question.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   They want the world.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.060]   I mean, it's usually the same thing.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:16.660]   They want it to be a combination of like having the right tools and like writing every day,
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:22.780]   like the romantic elements and I have a beautiful idea notebook and I write each morning, but
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:28.460]   I spend 10 minutes each morning, Instagramming a photo of my earthenware mug next to my notebook
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:36.220]   and I'm just going to have this brilliance eventually that it's going to shock the world.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.740]   The world is like, you got to convince an agent.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.460]   What are the agents, what do they care about?
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.620]   If you don't know the answer to that question, don't start yet.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.860]   That is going to be your first step is selling the agent.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.740]   So many people try to go around the agents, write to the publishers because they're worried
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.940]   it's too much of a proximate rejection.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.580]   It's a really quick rejection with an agent.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.900]   It's like, here's my query letter.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   Here's who I am.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   Here's my idea.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.900]   Do you want to find out more?
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.900]   And it's often like, no, that's not quite right.
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.900]   They don't want that rejection.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.940]   It's like, maybe I'll just go and send like a fully written nonfiction book, which is
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.020]   do not do straight to a publisher.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.020]   And why?
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.260]   Because I think it feels like, you know, maybe you never know, like it feels somehow like
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.060]   the rejection won't be so proximate.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.260]   Don't write your own story.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.060]   Learn how the world works, right?
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.220]   When you learn how the world works, it's accessible.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.620]   It might be hard, right?
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:30.460]   I mean, it might take years to get it done, to figure it out right.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.700]   But learn how it works and go for it.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.420]   The other problem that happens, and I see this a lot with writers, is they forever wheel
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   spin.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.660]   Especially like the potential novelists, it's just manuscript after manuscript, they just
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.660]   get stuck into like, I'm writing and I'm editing.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:47.340]   And like, no, get the wheels on the track sooner.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.340]   Like here's this thing.
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.940]   I'm pitching an agent.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.460]   They're telling me it's not right.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.700]   I'm going to do something else and pitch that agent and get like, be in the game as early
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.260]   as you can be in the game.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.820]   Find the easiest way in too.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.060]   Like that's another way to do this.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.860]   Like I got into book writing with student advice guides because it was the only thing
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.100]   I could sell as a 21 year old.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.540]   And they were easy to write, right?
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.140]   We were just, man, those were short chapters.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:17.580]   We were just with my agent and I were talking about my first book, which came out in 2005,
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.860]   I think.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.340]   And we're, we're updating a few, like making some corrections and, uh, you know, there's
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.380]   some stuff in 2005 that doesn't exist in 2025.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:31.660]   So we just had to go through, but I'm like, man, these chapters are like, you know, a
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.060]   page and a half when you print them out.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.900]   But like, that was like a very low friction way for me in the writing.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.620]   Like I could not have written so good.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:44.420]   They can't ignore you, uh, when I was 21, you know, but I was able, I wrote it when
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.620]   I was 29.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.620]   And by then I was ready.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.220]   I'd written three books and done a bunch of magazine writing.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.420]   I was like, I was ready to do it.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.300]   So like find low friction ways in, you know, it's like Michael Crichton.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.780]   He didn't start with Jurassic Park.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:03:01.540]   He started with these Zhongling, uh, pop boiler thrillers, which like back then we don't have
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.340]   this industry today, but back then, because there was no phones, right.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.340]   There was these huge industries of just, there's paperbacks everywhere.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.820]   Cause that's like your entertainment.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.620]   So they're like these like kind of bad paperback.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:14.700]   You buy them in the drugstore, you buy them at the supermarket, you'd read them in three
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.700]   days.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.940]   So today this equivalent would probably be writing online or something like this.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.940]   Right.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.980]   But he was just like, let me get in there and start figuring out how to actually like
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.300]   make writing work.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   You know?
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.420]   So I do have a soapbox.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.940]   I think writing is a great thing, but you gotta, you gotta embrace the reality of how
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.620]   that world works and do not let the social media companies take that energy from you.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.180]   I hate that they steal this from creative potential creatives.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.260]   It's such a target for them because it's a right target because if you're, if you're
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:47.220]   a creator, it is such like an appealing thing to be like, I could be doing this stuff on
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.500]   this platform and it feels productive and I'm checking things off and there's like a
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:57.900]   lottery feel that like something could go viral and it's all brain cycles that could
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.940]   be going to creating something new that matters.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:04.580]   Just being stolen and ossified into the stock price of like a small number of these giant
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.580]   conglomerates.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580]   All right.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.980]   Anyway, it's a good call.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.980]   Got me on my soapbox.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.140]   I went to a case study now.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:14.980]   This is where people send in accounts of how they put the ideas we talked about on this
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.780]   show and in my books into practice in their own life.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:24.140]   If you have a case study of your own, send it to Jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.740]   Today's case study comes from Connor.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:31.980]   Connor said, I played in the Australian football league for nine years.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.880]   During this time, I discovered how to become a straight A student and deep work.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.780]   These books helped me complete my degree in commerce.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.580]   While playing, I began to think about the life I wanted to live.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.620]   I couldn't see myself wearing a suit and being inside all day.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.100]   I wanted to be outside and began to appreciate my love of turf.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.660]   I used my career capital of playing to build relationships with the turf managers.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.380]   This allowed me to start my own lawn and garden business called Blakeley's Backyards.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:05.140]   Unexpectedly, my turf knowledge has also led to another development following my AFL career.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.660]   I started playing cricket at a community level with friends.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.940]   This escalated to where I'm now heading to the UK to play a season there.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.780]   Playing cricket in England will allow me to further my career capital in the sports turf
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.780]   world.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.060]   I will take back the intricacies of the English soil, growing conditions, and other gardening
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:24.340]   techniques to Australia when I'm done.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:30.140]   So Connor is a fantastic example of two career related ideas we talked about on here, lifestyle
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.720]   centric planning and career capital theory.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.820]   These go together real tightly.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.080]   So lifestyle centric planning says you need to work backwards from an image of your ideal
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.980]   lifestyle as opposed to trying to choose the perfect job.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.300]   So Connor here knows, I want to be outside.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.740]   I don't want to go to an office that the rhythm of that type of day feels wrong for me.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.740]   I want to be outside.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.460]   I want that type of autonomy, right?
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.900]   So now he's working backwards from a lifestyle vision.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.340]   There are many, many different ways that could get there.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.420]   He's really maximized his chances of actually finding something that gives him a lifestyle
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.420]   that's enjoyable.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.580]   This is much different than just choosing from scratch your perfect job, which may or
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.080]   may not work out.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.940]   He then deployed career capital theory, which is a fancy term for what we talked about back
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.120]   in the deep dive earlier in the show.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.820]   You want control over what your life is like, get good at something people care about.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.060]   The better you are, the more control you have.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.300]   And so he realized turf is something I could get good at.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.060]   He already had career capital in the sense that he came out of a sports league.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.220]   So he sort of had an entrance to this world.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.180]   He's not a random person.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:40.980]   And he's looking ahead to like his cricket career in England is going to give him even
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.100]   more career capital.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.940]   He's imagining how he can leverage this idea of like, I know about turf, I just spent a
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:46.940]   year in England.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.940]   I'm a professional athlete.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.460]   Like that's going to come together and really probably help what he's doing here with this
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:58.100]   turf business, which itself is a perfect fit for his lifestyle vision, right?
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.880]   So lifestyle centric planning plus career capital theory.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:07.340]   This is how people build deep lives, much more so than the dominant ideas of passion
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.260]   theory or grand goal theory.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:12.300]   I figure out some perfect thing for me to do, and if I succeed, I'll be happy.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.060]   And if I don't, I won't.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:18.180]   So Conor, I appreciate that case study.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.240]   Australian football is no joke, by the way.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.500]   He was writing that from a UK pub, by the way, and he like provided some explanation.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   I emailed him about it.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   What was he drinking?
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.860]   A pint of ale.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.860]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   We still, that's what we are missing.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.420]   We talked before about, you were above a bar here, shout out the Motocat.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:47.100]   We talked about having like a bucket system, but no, I think what we need is a English
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.620]   pub style beer engine, right?
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:55.460]   Because think about it, in the English pubs, they often have the casks in the cellar and
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.380]   then the beer engine, they use just like pressure and hand energy to like pump up from whatever.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.220]   So like we could have a beer engine, I feel like from some cask that they keep for us
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.620]   down at the actual bar down there.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   All right.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   I think we'd get more guests on the show if we did that.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.180]   If there was a beer engine inside the studio.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:18.940]   That would be a great show idea because you probably get people, if the interview goes
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.160]   on long enough and they're pumping that beer, you know, we'd get some interesting truths
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.260]   out of people after a while.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.260]   Like Rogan style.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   Rogan style.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   Let's get people.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:34.020]   Long Rogan style interviews with a beer engine in the room would get like a, I don't know.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.020]   It'd be like Elon Musk smoking marijuana.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:42.300]   Except for we'd have just like a drunk Oliver Berkman, who I'm interviewing soon.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.300]   That's just why I was thinking about that.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.300]   All right.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.020]   So we've got a final segment I want to get to.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.060]   Something cool I found on the internet that I'm going to react to.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.940]   But first I want to talk about another one of our sponsors.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.800]   In particular, I want to talk about Shopify.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.920]   When you think about businesses whose sales are rocketing, right?
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.280]   Like Feastables by Mr. Beast or Thrive Cosmetics or Silicon Valley's seemingly like mandatory
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.340]   weekend uniform supplier, Cotopaxi.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.780]   You think about the products and the brands, et cetera.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.500]   But what's often overlooked is the businesses behind the businesses that make the selling
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.500]   simple.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.740]   And so what is it that helps these famous brands sell like the actual mechanics of selling
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.740]   their products?
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:30.220]   And for millions of businesses, the answer to that question is Shopify.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.940]   Nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:40.420]   It's the home of the number one checkout on the planet and the not so secret, secret,
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:44.580]   which is their shop pay feature boost conversions up to 50%.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:49.940]   People do not abandon their Shopify shopping carts, which means you will sell more.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.060]   I mean, it's what people use when they want to sell things online.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.780]   Of course, they also have point of sales, they have all sorts of other products.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.500]   But like when you're thinking about e-commerce, you have to think about Shopify.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:06.340]   Hopefully our friend Zach who made the VBLCCP hats, which we debuted last week and I think
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.340]   were a big hit.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.700]   He emailed us back as well and he said that he could make it smaller if we want.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.020]   I mean, I thought it looked cool.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:17.620]   But anyways, if he sets up a shop, if we were selling those hats, which maybe we should,
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.100]   actually I am going to ask him, I want that hat with it smaller.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.100]   I'm going to talk to Zach.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   Okay.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.100]   I'm going to get that design perfect.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   Zach's the man.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.060]   But if we're going to sell those hats, not even a second thought, Shopify.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:33.740]   It's going to be the same software that's behind, you know, Cotopaxi, between Thrive,
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.620]   Cosmetic, Feastable, all of that same software, but so easy for us to set up and just going
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:42.420]   to, the conversions are going to be off the charts.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.980]   All the sort of ex-Soviet era bureaucrats that are going to be like, this reminds me
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.580]   of my days as the Commissar of Agricultural.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.940]   That's not a Zach thing, by the way.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940]   That's our acronym.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:54.940]   Just to be clear.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.620]   It's the CCP at the end of our acronym.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.260]   So anyways, businesses that sell more sell on Shopify.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:07.340]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout used by Cotopaxi and MrBeast.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.580]   Sign up for your $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.840]   And you need to type that in all lowercase.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.060]   Go to shopify.com/deep to upgrade your selling today.
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.060]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:28.140]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends at Element.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:32.420]   Elements Electrolyte Drink Mix is something I use every day.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.580]   I am often getting dehydrated.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:35.580]   I do a lot of speaking.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580]   I podcast.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   I do interviews.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:38.580]   I teach.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.980]   I'm on panels.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:47.080]   You lose a lot of moisture speaking and it's DC, which means six months out of the year.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.700]   You essentially live in a sauna.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.120]   I exercise a lot.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.540]   Element is how I rehydrate.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:59.580]   What I do actually is depending on how dehydrated I am, I control how much of the drink mix
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.380]   package I put into my water bottle.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.500]   I usually use like a full Nalgene bottle.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.860]   In the morning if I'm dehydrated, Element.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.540]   The afternoon after a hard day of work, Element.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.940]   After this podcast, Element.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.540]   Right now we're using the lime.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.540]   That's what I have.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.780]   We kind of do one box at a time, which I like.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.780]   The watermelon's good too.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.460]   Anyway, so the drink mix is great because it has the electrolyte balance you need but
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.400]   no junk, no sugar, no weird coloring agents.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.820]   You just know you can drink this and it's nothing bad.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.980]   It's just giving you what you need.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.980]   So I'm a big fan of Element.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.180]   I wanted to mention, however, they have this new product coming out, which you should keep
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.180]   your eyes on.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.100]   Element Sparkling, which delivers the same zero sugar electrolyte formulation you already
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:45.540]   know and trust, but in a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling water so you can just grab it
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.620]   out of the fridge already cold, which I think is really cool.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:57.740]   Now, the Sparkling has not been widely released yet, but if you are already an Element insider,
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:02.660]   you can purchase Element Sparkling right now.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.080]   So there's a good offer here.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:13.020]   You can get a free sample pack with any drink mix purchase you do at drinkelement.com/deep.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:19.320]   That's drinkelementlmnt.com/deep and you'll get a free sample pack with any drink mix
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.660]   purchase.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.980]   And if you're an Element insider, you have first access to Element Sparkling, a bold
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:27.700]   16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.340]   All right, Jesse, let's get to our final segment.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:35.300]   I like to react to things that I discover on the internet or that people send in to
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.620]   my interesting@calnewport.com email address during this final segment.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.740]   This is something cool that someone sent.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:48.220]   It was CS Lewis's advice to a young writer.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.660]   I don't know what this is from.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.620]   It's from some book I suppose he wrote, but I have it up on the screen here.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.340]   So if you are watching, instead of just listening, you'll see it here on the screen, but I'm
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.900]   going to read it.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.460]   All right.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.340]   Here's what he says.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.500]   It's very hard to give any general advice about writing.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.220]   Here's my attempt.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.840]   Number one, turn off the radio.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:18.460]   Number two, read all the good books you can and avoid nearly all magazines.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.480]   And number three, always write and read with the ear, not the eye.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.060]   You should hear every sentence you write as if it were being read aloud or spoken.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.820]   If it does not sound nice, try again.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:32.140]   All right, let's stop here before proceeding because I want to talk about those first three
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:38.060]   pieces of advice because not only is he dead on, but the advice is super relevant to our
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.320]   current digital moment as well.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.540]   Turn off the radio.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.820]   What is our modern equivalent of that?
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.860]   Turn off your phone.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:52.080]   In both cases, what he's saying is you do not want a source of context switching distraction.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.020]   You need every ounce your brain can offer to successfully write.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.260]   And I actually went down this rabbit hole.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.300]   I have a New Yorker piece right now in editing where as part of the piece, I wrote about
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:07.180]   the neuroscience of writing, TLDR.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.340]   It uses like all of your brain is really hard.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.340]   So don't have distractions.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.340]   All right.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.620]   Number two, he says, read all the good books you can and avoid nearly all magazines.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.140]   Yeah, that is true today as well.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.780]   Just replace magazines with like anything on your phone.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.220]   You want to be a good writer, you got to read good writers.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.780]   Don't be sitting watching the sort of hyper palatable distractions on your phone, the
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.060]   stuff coming on social media.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.260]   This is not going to make you a better writer because it's not good writing.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.660]   Back then it was magazines, today it's going to be your phone.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:42.420]   Number three, write and read with the ear, not the eye.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   This is so critical.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:46.100]   This is a big secret of my success.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.900]   And I wanted to point this out because people don't talk about it enough.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:55.860]   The internal rhythms of writing, which is entirely like an out loud thing, how sentence
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:01.160]   rhythm builds, how word sounds correspond with other word sounds.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.900]   Good professional writers care a lot about this.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.540]   And I don't think we talk about this enough.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.740]   My big competitive advantage that allowed me to get into writing earlier maybe than
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:12.980]   other people is that I did comedy writing in college.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.860]   I was the editor of the humor magazine at Dartmouth, The Jack-o'-lantern.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:23.700]   And I talked about this, I think, on maybe one of my recent Tim Ferriss episode visits.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.900]   But the thing about comedy writing is it's all sound and rhythm.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:31.780]   You have to take the same rhythms a standup comedian would have and you're translating
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780]   the words.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.420]   But for comedy writing to work, it's that you have to bring the writer along and set
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.340]   them up and then boom, catch them from off guard.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:44.340]   And so when you comedy write, you obsess about how the sentences sound inside your actual
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.100]   inner narrative.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.900]   It turns out that's what you need to do to write well.
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:53.300]   And so I sort of had a little bit of an advantage because comedy writing forces the matter.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.220]   It just works not at all.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.740]   You can write okay without caring about rhythm and sound.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.980]   You can't write comedy right at all without it.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:06.300]   By the time I got to like New Yorker writing, it's all rhythm and sound and commas and semicolons
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:11.140]   and how does this unfold and how does this word sound next to that word and this word
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.820]   with this word doesn't sound right.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.540]   Anyways, we don't emphasize that enough when we talk about writing, but it's music and
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.540]   you have to think about that way.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.540]   So great advice.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.540]   All right.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:23.060]   Another piece of advice from C.S. Lewis.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.340]   Write about what really interests you, whether it's real things or imaginary things and nothing
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.980]   else.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.860]   Notice this means that if you're interested only in writing, you will never be a writer
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.820]   because you have nothing to write about.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.540]   Yeah, I think this is still true.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:40.420]   We gave this advice to the aspiring writer earlier in this show.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:43.840]   You got to have something to say that people care about and you got to be the right person
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.840]   to say it, which means it's got to be something you care about too.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:54.100]   Interesting point where he says, whether it's real or imaginary, C.S. Lewis was a serious
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:18:00.340]   professor at Oxford and he was writing science fiction and fantasy.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.500]   I think it's really cool that this is what resonated.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:09.260]   His books pre Narnia books were science fiction, early 20th century science fiction.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.740]   And then he writes the Narnia books, which are fantasy.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:17.940]   So I think it's really cool that these dowdy Oxford dons were like, I'm going to write
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940]   fantasy.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   I'm going to write science fiction.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.220]   Like that's what spoke to them.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:25.420]   I talk about, here's another advertisement for my book, Slow Productivity.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.820]   I talk about the group that Lewis, along with his fellow Oxford professor, J.R.R.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.540]   Tolkien formed called the Inklings.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.580]   And I get into how they having this group of writers like help them figure out, find
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.940]   their voice and develop their careers.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.580]   And I talk about how you should do something similar in your own life if you're working
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.380]   on something cool.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.380]   So check out my book.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.380]   All right.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:49.740]   He also says, take great pains to be clear.
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:52.620]   Remember that though you start by knowing what you mean, the reader doesn't.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:57.180]   And a single ill chosen word may lead them to him, to a total misunderstanding.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.020]   All the way on board with this.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.100]   I think about this all the time in my writing.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.940]   How can I not only make this clear, but like perfectly clear.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.380]   And you have to be careful about red herrings and MacGuffins as well.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.380]   All right.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.700]   So what that means is you introduce something that doesn't pay off.
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.860]   You can't do that in nonfiction writing.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.600]   You can't, if I kind of start talking about this, it either has to be a reason I talked
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.580]   about it that I conclude right there, or I have to have a callback later.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:26.580]   It can't just be a non-sequitur.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.220]   It can't just sit there like a red herring or a MacGuffin.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:34.140]   I can't start going this way in the chapter and then shift gears without ever saying why.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:38.180]   The reader's mind tries to assemble as they read everything you're saying into a pattern
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.180]   that makes sense.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:44.580]   So when there's pieces that don't fit quite together, it is like alarm bells go off and
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:50.100]   there is a intuitive discomfort that the reader develops towards what they're writing.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:54.940]   So that's why like nonfiction writers, we obsess about how all the pieces fit together
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.100]   so that you don't notice anything when you read.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.580]   And so you probably under appreciate a piece of nonfiction writing that just explains something
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.300]   and it flows like, "Oh, I know more about that.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.300]   That was good."
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:09.700]   It seems easy and it's not because every piece had to fit with no red herrings or MacGuffins
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.700]   or hanging.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.540]   Everything comes together.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.580]   Same thing with screenplays.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.740]   Everyone thinks they can write a screenplay because they know movies.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:21.580]   Like I could write people talking and yes, you could write a scene that could be in a
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:22.580]   movie.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.900]   If you like movies, you could write a scene that could be in a movie.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:28.060]   You could come up with a plot idea that you can make a movie about, but can you write
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.060]   an hour and a half worth of scenes that all click together?
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.060]   All the characters get developed properly.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.160]   There's nothing just introduced that doesn't pay off.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.940]   There's no too much deuce ex machina, like everything kind of fits and flows together.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:43.860]   No loose strings hanging, nothing that catches the attention as being out of place by the
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.860]   viewer.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:47.460]   Can you do 90 minutes of a movie that has none of that?
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.700]   Well, that's really hard.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.860]   That's what's hard.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.860]   So we convince ourselves screenwriting is easy because you say, I could see myself writing
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:57.780]   that scene, but you can't do 20 of those scenes in a row without any of that friction coming
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.860]   in there.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.260]   So I think this is great advice.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.820]   All right, let's see what else he has here.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:03.820]   C.S.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:11.100]   Lewis also says, when you give up a bit of work, don't throw it away, put it in a drawer.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.340]   It may come in useful later.
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:17.700]   Much of my best work, or what I think is my best, is the rewriting of things begun and
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.380]   abandoned years earlier.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.660]   All right, I'm on board with that.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.380]   When I'm working on a book, for example, I use Scrivener.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:31.620]   I have more words in my cut folders than I have in the final things that I show up in
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   the book.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:37.780]   I save everything I cut, and I often am able to repurpose that later in the book or in
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.280]   later books.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.460]   So I agree with that.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.860]   Save what you're going to save.
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:43.860]   This one's interesting.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:48.260]   I don't know if I fully agree with this today, but it's interesting.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.460]   He says, don't use a typewriter.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:56.020]   The noise will destroy your sense of rhythm, which still needs years of training.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.100]   Here's how I read that.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.040]   Your tools matter.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:06.800]   And having a tool that you feel good about working with is what's important.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.940]   Because in the end, they're all just writing going on paper.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:11.040]   The speed differentials don't matter too much.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.320]   What matters is the tool that's going to produce the best work.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.020]   Don't get caught up with conveniences being all that important.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.060]   Because writing, look, writing takes a long amount of time.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:26.320]   The final step of getting words onto the page, whether you're handwriting or typewriting
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.060]   or using a very fancy word processor, like the difference between those two things is
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.980]   like an epsilon on what's actually required to write.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.140]   So, hey, what works for you?
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.020]   Feel okay with that.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:42.060]   So C.S. Lewis hand wrote, and he felt like the typewriter, like, yeah, I guess it's faster,
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.060]   but I don't like it.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   The rhythm's off.
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:47.100]   Why would I use a tool that's going to make me a worse writer?
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:52.900]   George R. Martin, who wrote, you know, obviously the Game of Thrones books, still uses one
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:57.300]   of the original versions of WordStar, one of the original word processors.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:03.340]   He has an old computer that runs the MS-DOS operating system, and he runs WordStar on
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:07.740]   MS-DOS and saves his manuscript files to floppy disks.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.180]   Yes, Microsoft Word is more convenient.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.180]   Yes, Scrivener is more convenient.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:14.340]   That's what works for him.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.900]   And that's way more important.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:20.740]   So I think that's how I would read that tool is, that rule rather, is the tool that works
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:25.820]   for you is what matters, not trying to have the best possible tool, whatever that means.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.620]   And finally, his last piece of advice, timeless, be sure you know the meaning or meanings of
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.780]   every word you use.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.700]   Yeah, don't try to be smarter than you are.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.860]   Don't think that fancy vocabulary is going to impress people.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.660]   The smartest people are often the clearest, right?
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.740]   They let their ideas shine, they don't try to gussy up the language.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.700]   So anyways, that's a cool piece of advice.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.660]   The link is in the show notes if you want to check it out for yourself.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.500]   But some things are timeless, and I think C.S. Lewis nailed it.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.740]   Everything there I would recommend even today to an aspiring writer.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.580]   All right, that's all the time we have for today's episode.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.340]   Thank you for listening.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.900]   We'll be back next week with another normal episode of the show.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.980]   It's the fall, so we're back in action again.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:10.980]   Vacations are over.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.220]   So we'll see you then, and until next time, as always, stay deep.
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:19.900]   Hey, so if you liked our discussion today about how to get good at things that matter
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:24.500]   so that you can take better control of your life, I think you will also like episode 308,
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.580]   which is called The Power of the Quiet Mind.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:31.380]   It gives you some extra things to think about when it comes to how you produce stuff that
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.660]   matters.
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.860]   Check it out.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:39.540]   And yet, just like with digital knowledge work, we once again have the sinking feeling
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:45.260]   that something is off, that our lives are somehow not quite right in a world in which
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.460]   we're looking at our phones so much.
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:52.260]   We can't say exactly why it's a problem, but people just feel uneasy when they survey the
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:55.300]   crowds around them and see everyone's face looking down.
