[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.740]   I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ lives in me.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.860]   Christ who is our life. He is in His church, not in the building, but He has taken up
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.320]   residence in the people. If you have Christ, you have the Spirit of Christ. Christ cannot,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.480]   will not forsake His true church. When you commune with the true and living church,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.260]   you're communing with the true and living Christ.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.500]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.980]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:01:08.640]   It's been a part of the sadness of ministry to see so much misrepresentation
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.540]   of the teaching of the Word of God, so much bad theology, so much bad practice,
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.240]   so many scandals and all of that in the church. And one would wonder what would be a way that
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.340]   the Lord could just sort of bring judgment on that.
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.680]   Well, in my lifetime, I've never seen anything anywhere near as effective as this COVID situation.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.600]   It has shut down more.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.420]   More bad churches than anything ever could have done.
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:53.320]   Narcissistic leadership. And the Lord has sifted and purged His church. Judgment begins
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.580]   at the house of God. That's not to say Grace Church is perfect. We know better than that.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.500]   But I will say this church is faithful, faithful to the Word of God, because the Word of God
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.580]   dominates our life and our thoughts.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.300]   And our conversation and our conduct and our relationships.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.340]   What really matters in the world is the church of Jesus Christ. And the church needs to be
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.500]   the church. But there were a lot of unfaithful churches that needed to shut down.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.900]   Judgment has come in a lot of ways. I have been far more terrified by false doctrine
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.180]   than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.180]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.180]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.200]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.260]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.280]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.340]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.440]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.620]   I have been far more terrified by false doctrine than I have by any virus.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.280]   Far more damage is done in this world by false teaching, false churches, scandalous pastors,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   bad theology, churches advocating things that blaspheme the name of God.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.720]   And I think it's a separating of the true church from the false.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.560]   Now we know how the Lord cares for His true church.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.260]   Psalm 91.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.240]   Psalm 91.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.640]   We know the Lord is committed to His true church.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.900]   He says to the true church, "I will never leave you or forsake you."
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.960]   He says to the true church, "In the world you will have trouble.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.680]   Be of good courage, I have overcome the world."
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.540]   He says to the true church, "I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.520]   prevail."
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   Psalm 91.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   Psalm 91.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   He says to the true church, "I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.940]   prevail against it."
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.740]   He says to His true church through the apostle Paul, "We always triumph in Christ."
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.120]   What has happened has certainly, among other things, in part been a judgment on false churches
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.700]   and weak churches and unfaithful churches, and it has been a purging time, and it has
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.840]   featured a spotlight on the faith.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.600]   It has been a spotlight on the faithful.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   They have been put under duress, not just us, but many churches.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.500]   Some pastors put in jail for being faithful.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:32.260]   All kinds of constraints, all kinds of assaults, but the faithful have been faithful, and the
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.800]   world has seen it.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.640]   You know, the Lord never hesitates to judge.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.120]   He doesn't judge openly.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.980]   Sometimes you hear people say, "Well, some of these bad things that are happening in
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.180]   the church are really concerning to me because the world is watching."
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.840]   You bet.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.300]   And God is going to judge His church right in front of them.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.380]   He's not going to do it secretly.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.300]   God has always judged an unfaithful people openly.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.440]   His judgment is never hidden.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.460]   And it's still going on as we see scandal after scandal after scandal connected to churches
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.700]   and leadership.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.680]   It's all exposed.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:30.260]   This whole issue of social justice compounded with this epidemic has cast a light on the
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.060]   behavior of churches and leaders.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.240]   But in the midst of it all, it's not.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.360]   We have seen the hand of the Lord in a mighty way, haven't we?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.940]   And the question that I want to direct your attention to today is, "What is the Lord doing
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.360]   in His true church?
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.860]   What is He doing in His true church?"
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.340]   There's no need to speculate on that.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.340]   Open your Bible to Revelation, chapter 1, Revelation, chapter 1.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.040]   This is one of the most magnificent, glorious.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:15.260]   Dramatic, instructive, Christ-exalting chapters in all of Holy Scripture.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.800]   Revelation is, as you know, identified in the first verse, the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.440]   The book of Revelation reveals Jesus Christ.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.840]   When you think of Revelation, you most immediately think of the revelation of Christ in judgment
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   coming in the future and in His return to judge.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.660]   And establish His kingdom, and then the new heaven and the new earth, and the new Jerusalem
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.480]   that wraps up the book of Revelation.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.760]   You think about the future.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.480]   You think about the future.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.740]   But the book of Revelation is not all about the future.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.700]   It's not all about the future.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.060]   The first chapter is, in fact, about the present.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.640]   Suffice it to say, this is a picture of Christ in His church.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.520]   That is crystal clear.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.360]   John is given a vision.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:23.960]   He looks at the seven lampstands, verse 13, and there he sees the Son of Man.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.140]   The Son of Man is described in detail.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.040]   We know who it is.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.440]   It is the living One, verse 18, who was dead and is alive.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.540]   He is alive forevermore and has the keys of death and Hades.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:48.960]   It is the very One named back in verse 5, Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.420]   born of the dead, the ruler of the kings of the earth, the One who loves us and released
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.860]   us from our sins by His blood, the One who made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.240]   and Father, the One to whom we give glory and dominion forever and ever.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   Amen.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.340]   "The Son who is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him."
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.420]   No doubt a reference to the Jewish nation.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:18.000]   "And all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him, so it is to be."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   Amen.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.160]   We have a picture here of Christ in His church.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   This is the only picture in the whole of Scripture of Christ in His church.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   And when you look at the church in the times in which we live.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.360]   I suppose even the apostle Paul did, and everybody between him and me.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.000]   You could be very discouraged and disillusioned.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Paul was.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.280]   He was heartbroken.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:09:00.240]   He was brought to tears by the issues that the church demonstrated as evidence of their
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.840]   disobedience and unfaithfulness.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   Amen.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.080]   And we who shepherd the flock of God are continually burdened by the care of the church.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.620]   This is not administrative.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.960]   This is spiritual care.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:28.740]   We have to give an account to God for the flock that we shepherd.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.640]   So what do we long for?
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.600]   Well.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   We long that people will be saved.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:42.720]   We long that people in the church would have deep fellowship with Christ, not something
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.760]   superficial or shallow.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:59.140]   We desire for people who are the church to see power over temptation, trials, sin.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.440]   We pray for them to be faithful, to be strong, to be victorious.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:11.060]   And, of course, we desire their holiness, their virtue.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.580]   We desire the purity of the church, doctrinally and behaviorally.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:24.800]   We desire that they understand the authority of the Word of God, and that they be sanctified
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.160]   by it.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.240]   We long for godly leaders to set a holy example for God's people.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:43.300]   We desire that the church be protected from unholy, satanic deception that comes from
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:49.060]   false teachers on the inside and the outside.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:59.300]   And we are concerned that the bride of Christ truly reflect His holy glory, so many will
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.040]   be drawn to His beauty and His salvation.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:14.180]   That's what a genuine shepherd cares for: the fellowship of the church, the power of
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:24.680]   the church, the purity of the church, the obedience to the Word of God of the church,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.140]   the example of godly leaders in the church, the protection of the church, and the reflection
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.840]   of the glory of God through the church.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:45.080]   That's what we want to see, because that's what our Lord desires.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:53.260]   Life can be very difficult, and the church can bring immense discouragement.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.240]   We could start with John.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.900]   John's an old man now.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.640]   John is at the end of that first century, maybe around 96.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:13.500]   He has every reason to be discouraged.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:25.740]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed - not exalted, not elevated, but destroyed - and
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.880]   destroyed at the hands of pagan Romans.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   He had lived to see Jerusalem destroyed.
