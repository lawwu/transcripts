[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.120]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.920]   Verses 12 and 13 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.880]   But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.120]   them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.080]   And I want to take with that this morning the fifth and sixth verses in the eleventh
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.680]   chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.240]   By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found because God
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.680]   had translated him.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.600]   For before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.880]   But without faith it is impossible to please him.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.400]   For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760]   diligently seek him.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   Now those who attend here regularly will realize the significance of the juxtaposition of those
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   two verses from the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews with the two verses
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.800]   in the first chapter of the gospel according to Saint John.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.480]   The basic statement is that statement in the prologue of John's gospel, that to as many
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   as received him gave he power to become the children of God.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.600]   And that is our basic theme which we've been examining now for a number of months.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.680]   And we're examining it from the standpoint that there is nothing more important for us
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.720]   in this world than to know that we are the children of God.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.840]   There is that great statement, to as many as received him, he gave that right to become
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840]   the children of God.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.760]   There is nothing higher than that.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   And the most important thing for us therefore I say is to make sure and to make certain
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   that we are the children of God.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   Now we do so for two main reasons.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   We can't enjoy the Christian life unless we have this assurance.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.520]   That's an obvious reason for making certain.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   But there's another, and indeed a much more important one.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.680]   We cannot function truly as the children of God unless we are clear about our title deeds,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   unless we know who we are, and unless we are walking and living in this world as the children
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   of God.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.600]   Now never was there a time when there was a greater need to realize this than just at
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.240]   this present time.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.600]   We live in an evil world, and your business and mine is to show the world a better way,
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.160]   the way of God.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.800]   And our responsibility is therefore a very great one.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.180]   We mustn't just look at ourselves and consider our own states and conditions.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.680]   We must be settled about that so that we can represent God and the Lord Jesus Christ to
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.080]   the world that is round and about us.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.800]   You remember the description given of the Christian by the Apostle Paul in the second
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   He says that we are like lights in the heavens in the firmament, and that our business is
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.840]   to hold forth the word of life in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation of people.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.560]   That is the description of us at this present time, my friends.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.160]   Crooked and perverse generation.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.680]   It is obvious, isn't it?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   Very well, your business and mine is not simply to denounce the crookedness.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.280]   It is to shine forth as lights in the heavens, as luminaries, showing a better way, a more
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   glorious way.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.360]   And to me, the first step in that is to be certain that we are the children of God.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.560]   A Christian who is uncertain is of no value.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.720]   He doesn't represent God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.560]   He is uncertain, as to spend all his time looking at himself and thinking about himself,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.080]   wanting some help for himself, not concerned about his responsibility to the world that
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.240]   is outside.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.160]   I say therefore, the first step is to be absolutely certain that we are the children
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   of God.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.240]   Now then, we have gone into the doctrine of this, we have looked at it, if you like, from
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.200]   the theoretical standpoint, and what we are now doing is we are looking at some examples
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.880]   of men and women like ourselves in this same world, having the same conditions to battle
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:00.280]   with, and oftentimes even worse, but who nevertheless lived triumphantly and gloriously, and bore
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.760]   their witness and their testimony to the truth of the things of God.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   In other words, we are now doing what the author of the epistle to the Hebrews himself
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.280]   does in this eleventh chapter.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.440]   He was writing to give people assurance of salvation, and he has worked out his mighty
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.560]   doctrine in the first ten chapters, but now he says, "I want to help you."
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.640]   And he helps them by giving them these examples and illustrations out of the Old Testament.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.520]   He says, "These men, like ourselves, were the children of God, but look how they lived,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   look how they triumphed.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.160]   And what they did, you can do.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.720]   They did it by faith, you must do it by faith in exactly the same way."
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.600]   Very well, and so he gives us this series of pictures and portraits of some of the notable
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.080]   Old Testament saints.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.320]   Now the thing that he emphasizes about them all is the thing he says in the second verse,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.200]   "By it, by faith, the elders obtained a good report.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.280]   Witness was born unto them that God was well pleased with them."
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.240]   That's his secret, he says, that's the secret of every one of them.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.200]   Now we've already examined this in the case of Abel, and we saw how the truth concerning
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.760]   him is brought out in particular by contrasting him with his brother Cain.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.160]   Now there we saw the importance of being quite certain as to the way in which we approach
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   God.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.720]   There is only one way.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.280]   We have to take the right offering.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.080]   We have to rely only upon our Lord and his perfect atoning work on our behalf.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.560]   Very well, we've looked at that.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.040]   But now we come along this morning and we look at a second case, the second case that
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.800]   he gives us, the case of Enoch.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.560]   I indicated last Sunday morning in dealing with the case of Abel that we mustn't think
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.360]   that every one of these cases is identical with all the others.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.160]   Fundamentally, of course, it's the same thing, it's faith.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.560]   But in each particular instance there is some peculiar aspect or angle of the matter that
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.120]   is brought out in a particular manner.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.600]   And therefore as we come to look at this case of Enoch, we shall find that there is something
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.800]   taught us here which wasn't taught us with the same fullness as we were dealing with
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.240]   the case of Abel.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.960]   Now there are some three main references to Enoch in the Bible.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.240]   Let me hurriedly remind you of them so that we shall be clear about the historical aspect
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   of this matter.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.000]   And indeed it is very important that we should do so if we are to learn the lesson truly.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.160]   The first reference is in the fifth chapter of the book of Genesis in verses 21 to 24.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.320]   And Enoch lived sixty and five years and beget Methuselah.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:05.360]   And Enoch walked with God after he beget Methuselah three hundred years and beget sons and daughters.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.240]   And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.560]   And Enoch walked with God.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.360]   And he was not, for God took him.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.040]   There is the historical detail that we are given with regard to Enoch.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.680]   Then there is this reference here in Hebrews 11 verses 5 and 6.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.280]   And there is furthermore that reference to him which we saw there in the epistle of Jude
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:43.240]   at the beginning in verses 14 and 15 where we read, "And Enoch also, the seventh from
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.280]   Adam, prophesied of these things, namely of the evil that was going to come, that is like
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.520]   the raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame, etc.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, 'Behold, the Lord cometh
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.680]   with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.120]   are ungodly among them of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.960]   all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'"
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:29.320]   Very well, there are the facts as we have given them concerning Enoch.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.440]   Now here is surely a most important case.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.360]   And you see how up to date the scripture is.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.920]   Don't forget that Enoch lived in the terrible, horrible days before the flood, the days of
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:52.760]   Sodom and Gomorrah, the days before the flood rather, these awful, dissolute, evil, sinful
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   days that are described in the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis, and which we hope
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.120]   to deal with, God willing, next Sunday morning in greater detail.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120]   But that was the period.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:11.960]   He lived in that age that led to the judgment of the flood, when men gave themselves to
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.520]   sin and evil and vice of every description.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.920]   Yet what we are told about this man is that he lived and walked with God and was well
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.640]   pleasing in God's sight.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.480]   So much so that we are told that he was translated, that he never saw death.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.400]   He was one of the two men that never died in the usual manner.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.160]   The other is, of course, the prophet Elijah.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480]   He was translated, that he should not see death.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.200]   He was taken by God.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.320]   How we don't know, we are not told.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   But he was.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.440]   He didn't have to die a natural death.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.720]   Obviously his body was changed in some manner that we can't understand.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   But he was taken as he was, as Elijah was taken, immediately to the presence of God
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   and to heaven.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.480]   Now that's not the thing that's going to concern us this morning.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.040]   But it is, of course, a notable and a remarkable thing.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   Incidentally it shows us the importance of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.880]   and that we must never surrender that.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.840]   We don't merely go on as spirits.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.680]   The whole man is to be saved.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.480]   The body is to be redeemed as well as the soul and spirit.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.840]   However, I say that isn't the thing that must keep us this morning.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.720]   The important thing about this case of Enoch is this.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:43.320]   As this man reminds us, that before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.940]   Now that's the thing.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.080]   It is true that Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.520]   because God had translated him.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   But the secret of the man, the reason ultimately why that did happen to him and why he was
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.000]   spared the agony and the suffering of death and all that is involved in the dissolution
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.760]   of the body, the ultimate reason for that is that he had this testimony that he pleased
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.840]   God.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.400]   That was the secret of this man, Enoch.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.560]   Now that is the thing to which I'm calling attention.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.920]   As I say, the common factor to all these people who are mentioned in this chapter is just
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.600]   that.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.920]   They were given the knowledge, the certain knowledge, that they were well-pleasing to
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.320]   God.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.720]   They were given a testimony.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.800]   You remember it in the case of Abel.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.360]   By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.000]   witness that he was righteous.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.040]   God testifying of his gifts.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   That's the thing.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.760]   He was given to know that God was pleased with his gift.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.920]   He wasn't uncertain.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   He was given the assurance so that before he was murdered by his brother, he was rejoicing
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.920]   in this assurance of his relationship to God.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.640]   And in the same way, we are told of Enoch.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:12.720]   Before he was translated, he had this testimony that he pleased God.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.000]   In other words, he is, you see, the second instance and example that this man gives of
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.080]   a man who enjoyed full assurance of salvation.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.880]   And the importance of that for us is this.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.800]   It was because he enjoyed this that he was able to live as he did in his day and generation.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   Amidst the sin and the vice and the evil of that pre-deluge world, this man stood out
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.280]   as a light in the heaven.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.320]   He rejoiced in his relationship to God, and he was a rebuke to all the ungodliness that
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.640]   was rampant, round, and about him.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.520]   Very well, you see the obvious importance of considering such a case.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   Now the first thing that arises, therefore, for our consideration is this.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.640]   How exactly was he given this testimony that he pleased God?
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.680]   We are told that he was given it.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.240]   Incidentally, I would entirely disagree at this point with the interpretation of this
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.360]   by the great Dr. John Owen, who says that the testimony is the testimony that is given
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.000]   to him in the Scripture.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.640]   But the Scripture tells us that the testimony was given him before his translation, and
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.600]   the Scriptures were not written until some considerable period of time afterwards.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.840]   No, no, this is not merely—this testimony is not the mere record of him in the Scripture.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   He was given it, as all these men were given it.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.840]   It is something personal, it is something subjective, it is in the realm of assurance
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080]   of salvation.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.920]   How did he receive this, I ask?
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.400]   How was he given this testimony that he pleased God?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   Well, I have no hesitation in answering that question in this way.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.440]   The answer, I suggest, is found in what we are told about him in Genesis 5, verse 24.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.720]   And Enoch walked with God.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   What does that mean?
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.160]   I am going on to show you later that it means the way, the manner in which he walked.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.440]   But there is something much more important than that.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.960]   And it is this.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.640]   Enoch knew that he was walking with God.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   God gave Enoch the privilege of his companionship.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.160]   Enoch knew that he was walking in the presence of God.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   He knew God.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.440]   God was his companion.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.120]   And God made it quite clear to him that he loved him, that he was well pleased with him,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.000]   and that he was a man after his own heart.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.400]   Now we are told about Abram that he was the friend of God.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   That is over and above believing in God.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.960]   So is walking with God.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.400]   The whole picture is of two companions walking along a road together, each one conscious
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.480]   of the presence of the other.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.560]   That is the very notion that is conveyed.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.840]   And I am suggesting, therefore, that God made it clear to Enoch that he was well pleased
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:14.920]   with him by letting him know that he was with him, giving him intimations of his nearness
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:21.960]   and of his presence, speaking to him in different ways, blessing him in certain manners, giving
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.400]   him this intimate personal realization that he was there.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.520]   I have quoted before, I think, the statement of an old Puritan of the name of Bolton in
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.160]   the seventeenth century.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.440]   He quotes a man who, dying, left this as his dying message to men and women, "God dealeth
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.120]   familiarly with men."
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   And he does.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.720]   That is the story that you get of the patriarchs.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.400]   God came down as it were and spoke to them.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   They knew.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.000]   They had a direct, immediate knowledge which is the height of assurance, as we have already
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.040]   seen.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.080]   And Enoch is a perfect instance of that.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.600]   Enoch walked with God.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:07.880]   Over and above his faith, he had this absolute certainty.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.280]   As God gave the same certainty, you remember, to Jacob that night when he was there at Peniel?
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.600]   So he did to Enoch, and in a much more striking manner, possibly, so that a man is able to
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.040]   say, "This is the house of God.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.960]   This is the gateway of heaven.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.040]   God is here."
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.800]   That is the kind of thing to which I am referring.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.840]   You get many instances of that in the Old Testament.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.720]   Very well, then, I say that he was given this testimony in that manner.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.600]   God let him know that he was pleased with him.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:47.200]   And God did so by giving him these manifestations of himself and these intimations of his good
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.080]   pleasure in him.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.160]   Very well, my friends, the question we ask ourselves, therefore, is this.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.920]   Do we know anything about that?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.360]   Do we know anything about walking with God?
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.720]   Do we know anything of God bearing us testimony that he is well pleased with us?
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.560]   Has he given us these intimations?
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   This is the important thing.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.800]   We can't function, I say truly, as Christians in this evil hour unless we have this very
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   thing.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.840]   Now, you notice my argument.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.080]   I am not here to denounce those who are outside this morning.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.120]   That is a very simple and an easy thing to do.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.440]   But that isn't the ultimate business of the Church.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.640]   The Church is to show and to manifest this other way.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   Mere denunciation of evil gets you nowhere.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.960]   It's obvious, it's easy, it's cheap.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.080]   I've no doubt a great deal of that will be done today, but it will be of no value to
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.880]   anybody at all.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.680]   What the world needs to know is this, that it's possible for a man to walk with God,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.520]   even in this evil world as it is today.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.100]   That's the thing that we must look for.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.520]   We can feel very happy as Pharisees and we say, "Thank God I'm not like that man."
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.200]   But that's sheer Phariseeism, my friend.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.120]   The question for you is this, not are you unlike that man, but are you like Enoch?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.440]   The need of the hour is a Church filled with men and women like Enoch who walk with God.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.160]   That's the way to reform the Church and the world.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   And any concentration on negatives alone will get us nowhere.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.560]   Very well, let's proceed to consider this man.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.600]   What was his secret?
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.120]   The answer is given in the sixth verse, which is of course an obvious commentary on verse
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   five.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.920]   "Without faith it is impossible to please him, to please God."
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.480]   Enoch did please God.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.240]   He was given the testimony that he had.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.800]   But without faith it is impossible to please him.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:47.560]   "For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.280]   diligently seek him."
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.840]   Now then, what were the secrets of Enoch?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:58.120]   Well, the first thing is obviously his faith, his faith.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.720]   This is always vital.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.000]   But it's interesting to notice the way in which this man puts it here.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   He says, "He that cometh to God."
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.560]   Now what does that mean?
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.680]   That's a most important phrase.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.080]   He that cometh to God.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.400]   It's a phrase that this man is not a fond of.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.120]   He's already used it in the tenth chapter in the first verse.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.360]   "For the law," he says, "having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.760]   of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.840]   make the comers thereunto perfect."
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.200]   The comers thereunto perfect.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.360]   He's dealing with the whole question of how a man is to approach God.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:52.720]   How a man has access in worship into the presence of the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.560]   Or, if you like, let me give you another phrase which indicates the same thing.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.840]   Romans 5, 1 and 2.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.760]   "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:20.000]   Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.400]   in hope of the glory of God."
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:28.800]   But the thing is, the access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, that's coming
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   unto God.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.200]   "He that cometh unto God."
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.880]   He who has access to God and is able to stand before him in grace.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.520]   "He that cometh unto God."
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   Now that's the meaning of the phrase.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.000]   It means access to God and his favor.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.800]   It means access or approach to God in worship.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.840]   So he that cometh to God is a man who is anxious to have this access into the presence of God.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.640]   This is the biggest thing in his life.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.320]   He doesn't just come to church mechanically and feel he's done his good day's deed.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   Wonderful.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   He goes to church.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   These other people don't.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   No, no.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   "He that cometh to God."
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.880]   That he may know him, that he may have access, that he may stand before him and have fellowship
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   and communion.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   That's the connotation.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.960]   "He that cometh to God."
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   So you see, this is the first thing we've got to concentrate on.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.160]   That was the great characteristic of Enoch.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   He lived for that.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.760]   That was life to Enoch, coming to God, entering into the presence.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.880]   Is it the chief thing with us, my friends?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   Very well.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:49.440]   We are therefore faced with the question, how does one truly come to God?
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.880]   Really make sure that you've arrived, that you're in the holiest of all, and that you're
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.320]   speaking to God and God is speaking to you.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.080]   You're having this access, this fellowship.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.560]   How does it happen?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.200]   And the answer is given, and it's the most important one.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:11.160]   "He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.080]   diligently seek him."
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.000]   Now, there is no statement in the Scripture, I think, that is more frequently misunderstood
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   than this.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's generally taken like this.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   "He that cometh to God," if a man's going to say his prayers, well, it's obvious.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560]   This is how it's interpreted.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.200]   The author is saying it's quite obvious.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.360]   You can't pray to God unless you believe in the existence of God.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.120]   And you can't really pray to God unless you believe that God is prepared to reward you
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   for your goodness.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.000]   "He that cometh unto God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600]   diligently seek him."
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.080]   Elementary, obvious, first principles.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.840]   Don't pray to God if you don't believe in the being of God.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.040]   Well, obviously, if you pray, you must believe in the existence, in the being of God.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.800]   And you must believe, furthermore, that if you live a good life and please him, God will
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   reward you.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:11.120]   In other words, you see, the popular interpretation today is the popular notion of Christianity
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   today.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.280]   A Christian is a man who believes in God and who believes that if he lives a good life,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.320]   God will be well pleased with him and he'll go to heaven.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.520]   If you believe in God and you believe that God is love at all, there's no more necessary.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Quite simple.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:31.400]   Believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.520]   But it's a very simple thing indeed to show that not only that that is wrong, but that
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.040]   it is an actual blank contradiction of what this man's teaching.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.480]   It's a contradiction of the whole of his epistle.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:47.720]   It is a contradiction of the whole of the teaching of the whole Bible.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.000]   That isn't what it means at all.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   There is a much bigger and deeper and fuller connotation.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   The chapter is about faith, the faith of these men of God, the faith that these Hebrew Christians
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.000]   were to have in the light of all the great doctrine that he's been expanding.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.160]   What is faith?
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.280]   Faith is this.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.760]   Faith is finally an acceptance and a submission to the revelation of God.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.400]   That is faith.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.960]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.400]   How do we know about the things?
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.240]   God has revealed them.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.040]   And you accept the revelation.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.240]   Very well then, so let's go on with a positive interpretation.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   He must believe, faith means first then that a man believes that God is.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.240]   He must believe that God is.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.960]   Now, here is the crucial phrase of course.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.080]   You see, when he says that he must believe that God is, and you can only do that, he
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.720]   says, by faith.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.840]   He is contrasting faith with speculation.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.520]   That's the contrast that's here.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   It isn't speculation.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.320]   Oh, there are many people speculating about God.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   They're writing books.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.440]   God's not up there, not out there.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.320]   God is depth.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.400]   That's sheer speculation.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.040]   Nothing like that in the Scriptures.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.080]   It's his men, modern men, having come of age.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.360]   He now is discovering God, as it were.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   He's giving a new description of God.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.960]   That's sheer speculation.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.520]   That's the antithesis of what we are told about Enoch.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   You see, that was the whole trouble, wasn't it, with those people whom the Apostle Paul
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.560]   was speaking to in Athens.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.800]   You remember how we are told that at Athens he addressed the Stoics and the Epicureans,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   and it's most interesting to notice what he says to them.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.160]   Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said, "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.560]   things you are too superstitious, too religious.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.960]   For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, 'To
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:08.680]   the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you.'"
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   That's the contrast.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.560]   You see, these Athenians, Stoics, Epicureans, typical philosophers, they had a notion that
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.400]   there was some ultimate being behind all their gods and behind all phenomena, and they were
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.000]   seeking, if happily they might seek after him and find him, speculating, putting up
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   his theories and postulates and examining and arguing and debating and wrangling.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.960]   "Look here," says Paul, "you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.880]   Whom ye ignorantly worship, the unknown God, you don't know him, I'm declaring him to
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   you."
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.160]   That's the contrast.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:50.000]   In other words, faith means the acceptance of the revelation that God has given of himself.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.120]   You see, Paul as a Jew was able to say to those Athenians, "I'm a Jew.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.000]   We've got the oracles of God.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.560]   We are not left with speculation and our own reason and understanding.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.800]   God has revealed himself.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   God has manifested himself.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.480]   He's chosen this nation of the Jews to give the revelation, and we have it written.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.240]   We have the oracles of God.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.600]   I'm not theorizing.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:17.680]   I'm telling you what God has manifested concerning himself to men and to the nation and all he's
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.800]   done with that nation and his purpose.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   Revelation.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.560]   That's what it means.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.760]   But that is only the beginning of what it means.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.280]   He that cometh to God must believe that he is he.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.160]   Now, surely there is a very profound and deep meaning here.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:45.520]   This is surely a reference to that peculiar revelation which God gave of himself to Moses
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.240]   and through him to the children of Israel.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.520]   Let me read the relevant passage to you.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.640]   God had been giving revelations of himself to all the patriarchs.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:05.840]   We've seen it already to Adam even, then to Abel, then to Enoch, Noah and others.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.160]   But a point came when he gave a very special revelation of himself to Moses.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.240]   Let me read to you therefore out of Exodus chapter 3, where I read this in verse 13.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.000]   "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.560]   say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say unto
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.760]   me, What is his name?
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.520]   What shall I say unto them?
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:41.920]   And God said unto Moses, I am that I am.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:49.200]   And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   you."
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.280]   I am.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.000]   Then let's notice the commentary which is given us on that in the sixth chapter of
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.320]   the book of Exodus.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.560]   Beginning at the second verse, "And God spake unto Moses and said unto him, I am the
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.120]   Lord.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.720]   And I appeared unto Abraham, and to Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:21.920]   But by my name Jehovah," that's to say, I am that I am, "was I not known to them."
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.760]   Now here is a very peculiar and special revelation of God as he gave it to the children of Israel
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.720]   just before he was going to lead them out of the captivity of Egypt and take them to
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.160]   their promised land.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   He reveals himself as, I am, that I am.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.840]   If you like, I shall be what I shall be.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   It's everything.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.880]   I always was, I always shall be.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.360]   I am.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.560]   God is.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:55.080]   And this is the peculiar name Jehovah that he always uses about himself when he wants
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.720]   to bring out his covenant relationship to his people.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.400]   That's why he did it at that particular juncture.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:08.600]   "Tell them that I am, hath sent me, the God who has pledged himself to you, the God
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.120]   whose people you are, the God who is going to bring you to your promised land."
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   Now then, what we are told here, therefore, here is this, that the first element in faith
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:26.800]   is that it believes that God is, that he is the everlasting and eternal God, the God who
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.400]   has revealed himself to his people in covenant language and in covenant form and with a certain
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.440]   purpose with respect to them.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.400]   Faith believes that, it submits to it.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.960]   It says, "I'm not interested in what the latest philosopher has said or the latest
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.600]   speculation of some clever fellow.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   No, no.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.360]   All I know about God is what I have in this book.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.040]   Here is God's revelation.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.960]   I submit utterly, absolutely."
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.200]   That's what Enoch did.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.760]   And that is what all who have faith must of necessity do.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.320]   So that you see, the man of faith doesn't say, "Oh, well, of course, now we are in
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.960]   1963.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.520]   We no longer believe in God up there, Father.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   That's Victorian.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   No, no.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.800]   Now we, of course, we've got to think now in scientific."
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.960]   The moment a man speaks like that, I don't hesitate to say about him, he is not a man
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   of faith.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   He is a speculating philosopher.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.560]   He may call himself a Christian.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.000]   We can't stop him doing that, but he is not a Christian.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.960]   A Christian is a man of faith.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:34.040]   He believes that God is what he has revealed himself to be.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.760]   He knows nothing apart from this revelation.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.800]   That's the first thing.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:44.720]   But then he adds to that, that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   What does this mean?
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.960]   Well, again, it doesn't just mean that God is loving, that God is kind.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.720]   He is that, but it means much more than that.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   You see, here in this phrase is again the whole content about the way of salvation.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.920]   He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.160]   You get adumbrations of this in the Old Testament.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:14.320]   "With thee," says the psalmist, "there is mercy that thou mayest be feared."
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   How did he know that?
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.840]   Did he just sit down and say, "God must be a God of love.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.600]   I can't conceive of a God who isn't prepared to forgive everybody and send everybody to
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   heaven at the end."
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   No, no, that's speculation again.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.840]   "With thee there is mercy that thou mayest be feared."
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   How does he know it?
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.800]   He knows it because of the revelation.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.400]   "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   How do I know that?
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.440]   Is it because I think it must be true because God is love?
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.280]   No, that's not the basis.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:50.520]   It's because God has said so.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.400]   All these statements of the Old Testament with regard to God's character, that's
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.920]   what we have before us here.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.800]   He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.240]   This is the great theme of the whole of the Bible.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.040]   This is the thing that the men of the Old Testament lived by.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.960]   They didn't see it as clearly as you and I should see it.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:19.240]   "Abraham rejoiced to see my day," says our Lord.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.440]   He saw it afar off and was glad.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   We are told that indeed about all these men at the end in verse 39.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.640]   These all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:36.200]   Indeed, we are told very specifically about them earlier in this chapter, that these men
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.600]   didn't see these things.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.280]   These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.920]   and were persuaded of them.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:53.680]   In other words, all these Old Testament saints had believed the revelation that God had given
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.440]   concerning his purpose of salvation.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.160]   That's what this means.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.960]   I reminded you last Sunday how he first announced it in the Garden of Eden.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.560]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   "It's all right," he said.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   "There is going to be a conflict.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.440]   Seed of the woman, seed of the serpent.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   Life's going to be difficult.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   Thorns, priors, troubles, struggle.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   It's all right."
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   "But," he said, "I'm giving you the promise.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   It's going to involve his being bruised in his heel.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   There's the great promise, the purpose of God in salvation."
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   And he goes on and on.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   Life's going to be difficult.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   Thorns, priors, troubles, struggle.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.440]   It's all right.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.440]   There's the great promise, the purpose of God in salvation."
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.120]   And he goes on unfolding it.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.280]   We saw in the case of Abel, the blood sacrifice had been revealed.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   And there it is again.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.960]   And on and on it goes.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:42.800]   Now that's the thing that is meant by that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.960]   him.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:51.040]   In other words, God at the very dawn of history made a proclamation.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.700]   He gave a revelation.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.080]   He addressed men in sin the moment he had fallen, and he gave him a kind of preview
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.480]   of history.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.320]   And he said, "You know, there's going to be a great division."
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.000]   God pronounced judgment upon sin.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.520]   He says he's a holy God and that he cannot wink at sin.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.560]   He denounces sin, he's going to punish sin.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.320]   Perfectly clear.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.000]   But he then gives this offer of salvation.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.660]   He announces his purpose of redemption.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.780]   And the two things run right through the whole of the Bible.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:30.460]   Now we have that specific statement of Jude to the effect that God had made this quite
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.500]   clear and that Enoch believed it.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:39.340]   Listen, "Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these things, saying, 'Behold,
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:45.580]   the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:51.300]   convince all that are ungodly among them of their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.020]   committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'"
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.380]   Enoch believed that statement of God.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.740]   He believed that God is going to judge the world in righteousness and punish sinners
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.460]   by banishment out of his sight eternally, everlasting destruction from the presence
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.460]   of the Lord.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.260]   He also believed the message of salvation and he gave himself to it.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:22.580]   He believed that God is this covenant God, this God of the promise, this God of the purpose,
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.460]   this God of the way of salvation.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:30.500]   He believed the two sides, judgment and redemption, and he submitted himself to it.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.140]   That's what he believed.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.240]   That's what faith means.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:41.060]   He must believe that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:48.020]   He submits himself utterly, absolutely to the revelation of God and his gracious purpose.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:53.180]   He trusted God's word utterly and based the whole of his life upon it.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.100]   That's the first thing.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.860]   But you notice that he adds to that.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:05.140]   He talks here about his diligently seeking God.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.580]   Without faith you can't begin.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.380]   Nothing can be done at all.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.780]   That's why the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   Didn't exercise faith.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.860]   It didn't believe the revelation.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.860]   Faith is the beginning.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860]   It's essential.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.740]   But in addition there were these further things about this man Enoch that he is a rewarder
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.780]   of them that diligently seek him.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.300]   Now our authorized translation here is right.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   It's good.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:40.580]   The New English Bible so called puts it that God is a rewarder, if I remember rightly,
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.220]   of those who search for him.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.580]   It's much more than searching for him, diligently seeking.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.940]   There's something special about this.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:55.900]   There is the whole notion of taking trouble to find him out and to be constantly doing
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   so.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.940]   You see, the Christian is not just a man who says, "Oh yes, I believe in God.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   I've always believed in God.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.540]   I've always brought up to believe in God.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.540]   Of course I believe.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.340]   I'm not a place of worship but if I believe in God I say my prayers."
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.340]   That's not Christianity.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.820]   Diligently seek him.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:17.820]   He not only knows how to seek him, but he goes on doing it.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.700]   The whole secret of Enoch in a sense was just this.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.420]   That while so many were godless and vile and evil, rounded about him in that ancient world,
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.500]   he believed in God and lived a fairly good life.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.420]   That's not Christianity.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.180]   That's not the child of God in any age or dispensation.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.460]   No, no.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.580]   He diligently sought him.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.300]   He didn't just say, "Of course I couldn't dream of doing things like that.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.300]   I can't join."
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:52.140]   And then just live a nice little quiet respectable life and say, "I believe in God and this
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.500]   is my kind of life."
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.540]   No, no.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.580]   He diligently sought him.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:05.780]   He sought God because he enjoyed God, because he wanted fellowship with God.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.620]   He didn't dismiss God in five minutes in the morning, reading a little portion of scripture
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.540]   and a comment on it and a little prayer and say, "I have done my daily portion.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.540]   I'm right with God."
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.620]   And then go on and think no more about God.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.620]   No, no.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620]   He sought him.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.460]   He wanted to realize his presence.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:25.540]   He was diligently looking for him, always, everywhere, at all times.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.560]   This was the big central thing in his life.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.700]   He diligently sought him.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:37.980]   He wasn't happy when he lost the sense, the conscious sense of the presence of God.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   My friends, that's what we are to enjoy.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.420]   To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, the children
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   of God.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.860]   And the child has access to the Father's presence when servants are not allowed.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.540]   He's always ready to receive the child and the child wants to be there and he wants to
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:02.140]   be near his father and he isn't happy when he's away.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.020]   Diligently seek him.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.300]   This was the big thing in the life of Enoch.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:14.260]   He wasn't happy when he wasn't enjoying this active, full, conscious presence of God.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.100]   So he sought him out diligently.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.020]   He was always seeking him.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.500]   He was always turning to him in thought, in meditation and in prayer.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.100]   It was the whole tenor of his life.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.060]   And then the third thing we are told about him is that which I've quoted from the fifth
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.600]   chapter of Genesis, "He walked with God."
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.660]   You see, the full life of faith is described here.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.580]   You get the whole basis in faith.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:49.220]   You get this devotional aspect, this experimental aspect, in experience, experiential aspect,
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.220]   I should call it.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:56.660]   And then thirdly, you get this practical outworking, "Enoch walked with God."
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:03.300]   Over and above his enjoying the companionship and having the intimation, it tells us a great
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.860]   deal about the type of life he was living.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:12.660]   You see, the fact about Enoch was that he always realised that he was walking in the
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.860]   presence of God.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.900]   And that is what walking with God means.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.540]   Let me divide it up to you as John actually divides it for us in his first epistle and
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   in the first chapter.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.260]   John, again, you see, writes to these people to give them assurance.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.220]   He says, "These things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.740]   Well, how are you to get this full joy?
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:42.380]   Listen, "This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you,
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:53.980]   that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:43:01.540]   So the man who walks with God is the man who is always reminding himself of that.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.420]   He is a man who says, "Wherever I go, God is.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:11.540]   I can never go out of the presence of God, work it out in terms of Psalm 139, if I go
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.740]   to heaven, take the wings of the morn, make my bed in hell, it doesn't matter, depths
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.420]   of the sea, God is everywhere."
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:23.020]   The man who walks with God is a man who reminds himself of that and is conscious of that.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.540]   Of course, he can go and do things in secret and men and women won't see him.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.820]   His wife won't see him, his cabinet colleagues won't see him.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.660]   God sees him.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:39.220]   And he knows that he is always everywhere in the presence of God.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:49.460]   And he knows that God is light and that in him is no darkness at all.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:57.300]   So he is a man who walks, I say, in that consciousness, and his chief desire is to please God, to
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:04.220]   keep God's laws and thereby to be well-pleasing in God's sight.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.500]   He knows that God has told us that "He it is that loveth me that keepeth my commandments."
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.820]   That love is not an empty sentiment.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.700]   Love is that which keeps the commandments of God.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.980]   If you love a person, you want to please that person.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.540]   If you love God, you want to please God.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.740]   You please God by keeping his commandments.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.980]   The man who walks with God and who wants to do so is a man, therefore, who does his utmost
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.700]   to keep the commandments of God.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:34.580]   Or to put it negatively, he avoids everything that displeases God.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.740]   Listen to John again, 1 John 1, 6.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:47.980]   If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.980]   truth.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.780]   You can't say that you are walking with God if in the meantime you are walking in darkness,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.780]   the thing is impossible.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.140]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.380]   So if you are walking with God, you are not walking in the darkness, you are walking in
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   the light.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.780]   If you say that you are in fellowship with him and walking in darkness, you are a liar.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.780]   You are deceiving yourself.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.620]   You are not deceiving God.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.060]   You are deceiving yourself.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:15.100]   And if you are a true man of God, you don't want to do that.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:21.660]   Or another way, as John puts it in the second chapter, in verses 15 to 17, "Love not the
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.220]   world, neither the things that are in the world."
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.580]   We know what they are, don't we?
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.500]   They have been plastered before us this last week.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:37.420]   Papers, television, "Love not the world, the clever world, nor the things that are
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.420]   in the world.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:43.300]   If any man loved the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.940]   For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:56.580]   pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.820]   And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.660]   But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever."
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.780]   Very well, he avoids these things.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:15.260]   He hates the world because he loves God and he wants to be well-pleasing in his sight.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:23.340]   Then should he inadvertently fall into sin, he is grieved, he is heartbroken.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.060]   Do you heal yourselves lightly when you fall into sin, my friends, or does it grieve you
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.380]   that you have sinned against this God who so loved you as to send his only Son to die
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.620]   for you?
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.460]   Does it grieve you, does it get you down?
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.900]   It should, but you don't remain on the ground.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:43.300]   You go on and say in 1 John 1, 7, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we are
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:50.860]   fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.480]   all sin."
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.660]   He believes that.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:59.580]   He believes further that if we confess our sins, he who is, is faithful, and just to
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.220]   forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.140]   So he doesn't say, "I have ceased to be a Christian.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   I might as well give up."
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.740]   He says, "No, I'll go back to him.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.980]   I'll go to my Father," and he confesses it, and he accepts and believes that he is completely
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.500]   forgiven and cleansed anew and afresh.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:23.620]   And he gets up and he goes on walking with God in the light.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.020]   That was the secret of Enoch.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:36.020]   As it has always been the secret of every child of God in every age and generation,
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.740]   is it ours, my friends?
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.500]   Do we know God?
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.940]   Do we know what it is to walk consciously with God?
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.380]   Is this the height of our ambition?
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.420]   Is this our greatest concern?
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.860]   To enjoy his companionship, to be well-pleasing in his sight?
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:58.300]   Whatever the world may do or say, this.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:07.260]   That was the whole secret of this man Enoch.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:12.740]   And it was because he was like that that God translated him.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:17.940]   I rather like the way an old Welsh preacher used to put this.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.820]   His way of putting it was like this.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:28.700]   Here was this man Enoch, he said, walking with God.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:35.780]   Every day he'd go and look for God, and they'd have a walk together.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.900]   And then God would say, "Well, I must leave you now.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.280]   You go home and sleep.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.260]   Get up in the morning and do your work, and I'll look out for you again tomorrow."
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.620]   This was the life that Enoch lived.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   This was his greatest delight.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.980]   He had his work to do, of course, but the thing he always looked for was when he could
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:58.580]   specially give himself utterly and absolutely to taking a walk with God and enjoying his
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.220]   companionship and fellowship.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.300]   And he'd been doing this, as we are told, in the record, for several hundred years,
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.820]   and he was enjoying it every day.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.860]   And one day he went as usual.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.580]   He'd finished his work, and he went to the meeting place, and there was God waiting for
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.580]   him.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.820]   And they walked together, and it was wonderful.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.720]   God had never been so loving.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.340]   God had never been so kind, and Enoch had never been so happy.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.540]   But the time came, the usual time, for God to say, "Very well, I must leave you at
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.180]   that for today, and we'll meet again tomorrow."
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:33.100]   But God didn't say that on this occasion.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:39.940]   He said, "Enoch, we've been doing this now so long together.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.860]   You enjoy it.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.860]   I enjoy it."
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:50.320]   "I'm not going to say to you tonight what I've generally said.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.240]   Go home and rest and sleep and get up and do your work and look for me tomorrow."
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.120]   Enoch, he said, "Come with me.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   Don't go home.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   Come with me."
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   So he took him.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.040]   He was not.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.800]   God took him to his everlasting habitation.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.080]   The perpetual fellowship was to be absolute.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.240]   There was never to be another break or another intermission.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:20.480]   All right, it was an old preacher's imagination, but you know, there's a profound truth in
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.100]   it.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.880]   You and I should have such an intimate knowledge of God that it really more or less comes to
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.920]   that.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   And what is death?
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.160]   Well, then death, you see, just becomes this, that God says to us, "All right, I'm not
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.560]   going to leave you in this old world any longer.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   Come along.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.080]   Come to me permanently.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:46.440]   Come into the everlasting habitation that my beloved Son has prepared for you.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.440]   Come home.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:56.160]   Come with me and be with me for the remainder of eternity, for everlasting life, for endless
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.520]   living in my presence.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   Come home."
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.880]   Very well, my friends.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   What a life.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.120]   What a glorious life.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:11.680]   The secret of death, to live like death and to die like death, is to be like this man
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.960]   Enoch.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:24.760]   You walk by faith with the God whose presence and companionship you seek above everything
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   else.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:32.720]   And he'll let you know that you are well-pleasing in his sight, that you are his child, and
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:39.520]   that sooner or later he will just take you home.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.360]   And then you'll say forever with the Lord, "Amen."
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.760]   So let it be.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   Amen.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.680]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
