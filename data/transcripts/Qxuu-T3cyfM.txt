[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   As I was thinking about Father's Day, I couldn't get past one particular portion of Scripture
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.420]   because it has so much to say about the most important Father, and it is the passage in
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.040]   Matthew 6.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.340]   So open your Bible, if you will, to Matthew 6, and I want to read what is a very familiar
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.940]   portion of Scripture, often called the Lord's Prayer, when in reality it is the disciples'
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.940]   prayer.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.040]   But you'll recognize the truth that's here.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   Matthew 6.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.760]   Let me read starting at verse 5.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.100]   I just want to have the framework of this in your mind, and then we'll particularly
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.860]   focus on a narrow but critical priority in this passage.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.860]   Verse 5.
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.860]   When you pray.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.580]   You are not to be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.240]   and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860]   Truly, I say to you, they have their reward in full.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.480]   But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.380]   who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.180]   And when you're praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.460]   that they will be heard for their many words.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.080]   So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.580]   Pray then in this way: "Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.380]   Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   Amen."
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.840]   "Bless this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   debtors.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.240]   And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.380]   For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.480]   Amen."
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.940]   Thinking about Father's Day, again I was drawn to this passage because it repeatedly addresses
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.340]   God as Father.
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.900]   "The Father is the Father."
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.680]   That's what we need to understand in its most full sense, the relationship that we
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.120]   enjoy with the eternal God.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.420]   He is our Father.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.660]   In what sense?
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.660]   Well, we could say He's our Father in the physical sense.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:55.420]   In the natural sense, Malachi 2:10 says, "Do we not all have one Father, has not one God?"
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.340]   "One God created us."
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.580]   So He is our Father in the sense that He is the source of life for all of humanity and
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.020]   all of creation.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.700]   But He's Father also in a covenantal sense with one nation, Israel.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.080]   You remember that the Jews understood Him to be their Father, Isaiah 63:16, "You are
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   our Father, O Lord."
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.940]   So He is our Father in a natural sense.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.520]   He is the Father to the nation Israel in a covenantal sense.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.080]   But importantly, He is the Father of all believers in a spiritual sense.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.100]   And they understood that in the Old Testament.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.140]   Psalm 89:26 says, "You are my Father."
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.300]   That's personal.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.460]   "You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation."
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.940]   Although it isn't fully developed in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament,
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.780]   an Old Testament-believing Jew would have understood that God was to him not only a
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.640]   physical Father in terms of creation, not only a national Father in terms of covenant,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   but a personal Father in terms of spiritual life.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.820]   This is picked up, of course, in John 1, which says, "To all who believe and received Christ,
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.180]   He gave the right to be called the children of God."
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.880]   To all who believe, to all who receive Christ, He gives the right to be called the children
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.600]   of God.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.280]   Believers are the children of God.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.200]   Nonbelievers, said Jesus, are the children of the devil.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.940]   So I want us to look at the aspect of God's fatherhood, obviously, in the spiritual sense.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.340]   And we are to understand it in the most intimate way.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340]   In Galatians 4, it says that, "God is a Father."
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.120]   God is our Father in such an intimate way that we can address Him as Abba, which is
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.180]   an endearing term like Papa or Daddy.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.100]   We can have that level of intimacy and familiarity with God.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.660]   Since God is our Father and we are the beloved children whom He has literally given spiritual
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.860]   life and in His family invited us so that we will be forever His both adopted and His
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:33.700]   regenerated children, we need to understand this aspect of prayer in its most full sense.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.680]   So when you look at the prayer itself, just going down to verse 9 through 13, "Here we
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.540]   are told to pray this way: 'Our Father who is in heaven.'"
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.380]   That should, therefore, embody the gospel.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   "Our Father who is in heaven."
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   That's the word that we use.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.060]   So we go to one who has designated himself as a father, and a father is the one who has
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.220]   all the resources we need, who provides everything that we could ever want or ever need.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.660]   And we have a right to ask him for those things that are urgent and important and necessary.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.020]   And you're familiar with the three requests at the end of the disciples' prayer: "Give
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.660]   us this day our daily bread."
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.900]   You go to your Father for your physical sustenance.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.980]   Physical sustenance for what you need physically.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.280]   And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.800]   And you go to your Father to provide for you what you need spiritually.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.320]   And then thirdly, "Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.560]   You go to your Father to seek for protection from your enemies.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.420]   So those three categories.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.000]   What we need physically, what we need spiritually, and protection from our enemies.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   Those are the requests, those are the categories in life that we literally fill up with our
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.020]   specific requests.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.360]   They have to do with physical life, temporal life, spiritual life, and even that evil reality
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.900]   that surrounds us that can be such a threat to us.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.420]   Now, I don't want to talk about those categories.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.420]   They're obvious.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   I'm familiar with them.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.900]   But what I want to do is talk about what comes before that in this prayer.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.240]   That's why I've titled it "The Worship of Prayer," because if you go back to verse
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:01.220]   9, and just look at verses 9 and 10, our Lord said, "Pray then in this way: 'Our Father
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.900]   who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.300]   Your kingdom come.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.540]   Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'"
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.300]   Prayer starts with God's name.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.220]   God's kingdom, and God's will.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:26.040]   In John 14, we read that when we come to the Son of God, who will go to the Father on our
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.700]   behalf, and He will answer all those prayers that are according to His name, it says this:
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.700]   that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.180]   So we start our prayers with a recognition that the priority is God.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.820]   The priority is for God to be glorified.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:59.200]   We want His name, His kingdom, His will to be the priority so that His glory is the priority,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.440]   that God may be glorified.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:10.060]   I don't think that it's common to understand that prayer is primarily for the glory of
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.060]   God.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.180]   Now, the disciples had heard Jesus pray regularly.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.100]   Obviously, they were with Him all the time, and in the 11th chapter of Luke, in the first
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.560]   verse, they said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray."
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.260]   How should we pray?
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:36.920]   He taught them that prayer was personal, intimate communion with their Father, and He gave them
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.820]   a model for praying.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.940]   Yes, there is a place for going.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.560]   Going to God with your physical needs, going to God with your spiritual needs, and going
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:55.140]   to Him for protection from the evil that surrounds us.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:01.380]   But before you ever get to those categories of request, you have to find your way through
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:10.020]   the priority in prayer, which is that God's name be hallowed, His kingdom come, and His
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.820]   will be done.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:21.380]   Bread, symbolic of our physical needs; forgiveness, symbolic of our spiritual needs, leading us
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:27.040]   not into temptation, a cry for protection.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.160]   But what comes first is the filter through which all of that has to be viewed.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.820]   Now, it's a common sin in praying, and this, I think, is obvious to most of you.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.700]   There's a common sin in praying that's pretty popular in evangelicalism.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.200]   It's a common sin in praying that's pretty popular in evangelicalism these days.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:53.120]   It's thinking that God has to deliver to you what you want, that somehow God is obligated
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.720]   to give you what you want or what you desire.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.820]   In fact, it reaches pretty massive proportions when you think about the breadth and length
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.740]   and height and depth of the Charismatic Movement in particular, which basically says, "Name
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.580]   it and claim it.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.980]   For the Lord, He is bound to give you.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.040]   If you identify it and name it and claim a right to it, He has to deliver."
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.160]   This is often called positive confession.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.760]   You confess something positively, you literally activate its reality in your life.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.220]   You don't want to ever say anything negative because you will activate a negative reality
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.340]   in your life.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.300]   You have the power, the creative power, to create the world that you want to live in.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.460]   You create it by your positive confession.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:49.060]   Some call it the spirit of supernatural or spiritual attraction.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.840]   You literally attract to you the reality that you desire.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.600]   You create what you want.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.760]   You do it with faith words.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.120]   If you have enough faith, if you believe hard enough and long enough, and you articulate
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.340]   it openly, you will literally create the world that you want.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:19.520]   Prayer becomes a mechanism for people to get what they want, what they desire.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:29.940]   I want to show you one scripture that deals a death blow to that notion, and it's found
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:37.440]   in the book of James in the fourth chapter and the third verse.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.220]   Listen to what James writes.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:50.620]   Verse 3, James 4: "You ask and do not receive.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.340]   You ask and do not receive."
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.720]   Why?
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:06.140]   Because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.740]   Here is a guarantee.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.100]   If you ask God, "I want to do this."
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:18.880]   You ask for what you want, you're going to get a "no."
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.900]   That's what it's saying.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.940]   It's really the opposite of the prosperity message.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.060]   You want to guarantee that your prayer is not answered?
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:37.700]   Then just ask for what you want without regard for God.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.980]   Now this kind of self-centered praying is a good thing.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:48.780]   Self-centered praying is a product of self-centered evangelism, superficial, shallow, false gospels.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.480]   You come to Jesus because of something you want.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.640]   You come to Jesus so you can get what you need.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.580]   You come to Jesus so you can have whatever you want out of life, so that you can have
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.640]   the best that life has to offer.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.860]   When evangelism is selfish, you create an environment in which selfishness is elevated.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:19.000]   So you came to Christ because you wanted Him to give you what you want.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.540]   And now that He has supposedly taken over your life, you're going to begin the list
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:30.180]   of requests, and you're going to roll them out as a regular routine in your life.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.300]   And what you're going to find is if your prayers are all about what you want, you have a promise
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.640]   in James 4:3 that you're not going to get the answer you want.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.740]   So in reality, it's the answer.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.340]   It's the opposite of what people are told.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:54.400]   The Lord is not just going to give you what you want, and no sensible father would.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.920]   This idea that you can demand things from God, this idea that God has sort of boxed
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.960]   Himself into a corner from which you cannot escape, and He trapped Himself into becoming
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.620]   subject to you, and He's sort of like the genie in the bottle that you call on for whatever
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:17.520]   you want, this is a mockery of God.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.380]   But when the gospel is not God-centered and salvation is not God-centered, then prayer
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.860]   is not God-centered either.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.980]   And I just want to show you the difference between that kind of praying and the kind
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:40.500]   of praying that we're taught here that begins with your name being hallowed.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:46.280]   "Your kingdom coming, and Your will being done."
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.560]   Now there are a lot of prayers in the Bible that illustrate this, but I'm going to pick
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:58.060]   a few, and it'll be obvious to you, but I just want to use them for the powerful illustration
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.060]   that they are.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.420]   Go back to the book of Nehemiah.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.880]   Back to the book of Nehemiah.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.380]   Nehemiah is a leader who is being used by God.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:19.880]   God in the restoration of the people of Israel when they've come back from captivity.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   And Nehemiah prays a prayer in chapter 9.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   Having read the law of God, he then hears people confess their sins and worship the
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.260]   Lord their God, verse 3, Nehemiah 9:3.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.720]   Then the Levites come together, and they cry out with a loud voice to the Lord their
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.240]   God.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.440]   They want the nation rebuilt, the city rebuilt, all of those things.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:17:02.840]   But listen to their prayer, starting in verse 5: "O may Your glorious name be blessed!"
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:10.140]   They began exactly where the disciples' prayer began: "Hallowed be Your name!
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.280]   O may Your glorious name be blessed!
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.120]   And exalted above all blessing and praise!"
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.680]   Now follow this, how it continues to be the theme through this whole prayer: "You alone
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.140]   are the Lord.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.580]   You have made the heavens," etc., etc.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.760]   Verse 7: "You are the Lord God."
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.020]   Verse 8: "You found Abraham's heart faithful before You, and made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   Verse 9: "You are the Lord God."
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.020]   Verse 10: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   Verse 11: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.020]   Verse 12: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.020]   Verse 13: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   Verse 14: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   Verse 15: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   Verse 16: "You made a covenant with the Lord.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   You made a covenant with the Lord.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.020]   You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.020]   Verse 17: "You made a covenant with the Lord.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020]   You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.020]   Verse 18: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   Verse 19: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   Verse 20: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.020]   Verse 21: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.020]   Verse 22: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.020]   Verse 23: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   Verse 24: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   Verse 25: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.020]   Verse 26: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.020]   Verse 27: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   Verse 28: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.020]   Verse 29: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   Verse 30: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   Verse 31: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   Verse 31: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.020]   Verse 32: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   Verse 33: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   Verse 34: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.020]   Verse 35: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   Verse 36: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.020]   Verse 37: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   Verse 38: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   Verse 39: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020]   Verse 40: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   Verse 41: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020]   Verse 42: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020]   Verse 43: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020]   Verse 44: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   Verse 45: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   Verse 46: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   Verse 47: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.020]   Verse 48: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.020]   Verse 49: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.020]   Verse 50: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.020]   Verse 51: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.020]   Verse 52: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.020]   Verse 53: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   Verse 54: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.020]   Verse 55: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   Verse 56: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   Verse 57: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.020]   Verse 58: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.020]   Verse 59: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.020]   Verse 60: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   Verse 61: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.020]   Verse 62: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.020]   Verse 63: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.020]   Verse 64: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020]   Verse 65: "You made a covenant with the Lord."
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.620]   Verse 66: "So you made known to them your holy Sabbath, and laid down for them commandments,
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.620]   statutes, and law through your servant Moses."
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.960]   Now, look, do you think God knows this?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.260]   Do you think He knows all this?
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.020]   Yes, of course He does.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.720]   Of what benefit is this to God?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.920]   A very minute benefit to God in one sense that He doesn't need the information, but
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.020]   it is massively beneficial to the one who prays.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:20.160]   To pray like this, because you are establishing God's character and God's power as displayed
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.320]   in history.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.940]   This strengthens the heart of the one who prays.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.800]   You provide in verse 15 bread from heaven.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.120]   You brought forth water from the rock.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.520]   You told them to enter in order to possess the land.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.020]   And you, down in verse 17, you're a God of forgiveness, gracious, and compassionate.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.080]   Slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.480]   This is what worship is.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.920]   It is rehearsing the nature of God and the work of God.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.240]   This is who you are.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.780]   This is what you do.
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.040]   This is who you are.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.000]   This is what you have done.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.780]   Verse 19: "You in your great compassion guided them on their way."
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.140]   Verse 20: "You gave your good spirit to instruct them.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.820]   You gave them manna."
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.020]   Verse 21: "You provided for them in the wilderness.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.980]   And they were not in want."
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:20.000]   Verse 22: "You also gave them kingdoms and peoples when they came into the promised land."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.440]   Verse 23: "You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.960]   You brought them into the land which you had told their fathers to enter and possess."
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:36.700]   Down in verse 27: "You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.700]   them.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.020]   But when they cried to you in the time of their distress, you heard from heaven.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.400]   And according to your great compassion, you gave them deliverers who delivered them from
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.780]   the hand of their oppressors."
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:53.260]   Again, he says it in verse 28: "When they cried to you again, you heard from heaven.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.800]   And many times you rescued them according to your compassion.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.060]   You admonished them."
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.000]   This is just constant rehearsal of what the Lord has done.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.020]   Kind of wrapping it up, verse 30: "You bore with them for many years.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.980]   You admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.200]   Yet they would not give ear.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.780]   Nevertheless, in your great compassion, you did not make an end of them or forsake them,
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.740]   for you are a gracious and compassionate God."
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:35.920]   This is really an incredible rehearsal of the things that God has done with Israel from
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.020]   getting them out of Egypt to getting them into the promised land, detail by detail by
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.840]   detail.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.500]   These men are saying to God, "We know who You are.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.580]   We know what You have done."
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.260]   This is worship.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260]   This is worship.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.860]   You don't even find a request.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:05.960]   It's just this unending flow of worship.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.020]   It's very similar to another Old Testament prayer.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:17.920]   Turn over to Daniel, chapter 9, and I think this will be enough to make the point, although
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.860]   there are others I could show you, and this one's a little more brief.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:32.320]   But Daniel is also praying for his people, and he starts his prayer in Daniel 9, verse
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:41.020]   4: "I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed and said, 'Alas, O Lord!
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:48.540]   The great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.260]   love Him and keep His commandments.'"
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:56.580]   Again, this is prayer as worship.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:07.520]   He is extolling God, honoring God, adoring God for who He is and what He has done.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.020]   In contrast to the people, verse 5, "who have sinned, committed iniquity, acted in
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.980]   wickedness, and rebelled, and turned aside from Your commandments and ordinances."
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:24.200]   In verse 7, "Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame."
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.940]   Part of worship is understanding this contrast.
