[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.760]   >> You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.080]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840]   Today, Jesse, Troy, and I talk about
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   our experiences with difficult managers,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.880]   what we did about it, and what we learned from it.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.720]   All right, let's get started.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.920]   Dealing with difficult managers.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.660]   We've all had them, maybe you're one.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.160]   If you're self-aware, you know.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.720]   Have you guys had experiences with
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.600]   just really challenging managers?
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.320]   >> No, they've all been perfect.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.640]   >> They've all been perfect? Everyone listening?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.560]   >> No mistake. Not irritating, micromanaging.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   >> Yeah. Jesse and I are freelancers for a reason,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.760]   I think. I think I've
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000]   definitely had some experiences and
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.120]   some are further up the needle in terms of challenging.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.520]   But you have to think about it in terms of it's a relationship,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.880]   not unlike any other relationship that we have in our lives.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.520]   If there's challenges there,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.640]   you're a part of that.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.240]   I think with all of these challenges that we're talking about,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.760]   my advice is try to lean into it a little bit,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.880]   and embrace the discomfort.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.560]   I know that in the moment,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.440]   that's a lot easier said than done.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.040]   But the more you can embrace it,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.720]   the more you can try to understand it,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.520]   and understand what's put yourself in your manager's shoes,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.440]   what's driving the way they're working with you,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.920]   and then of course, try to take a step back for yourself,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.000]   and understand what is it that's tying you up and not.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.600]   Sometimes it's not the surface level thing that you think it might be,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   if you take a second to think back.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.360]   I had a manager at the same company that I mentioned before,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.680]   I interviewed with her and was blown away.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.840]   Loved her personality.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   She had incredible credentials.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.200]   Interviewed with her team, everybody seemed fantastic.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.240]   Early on, I got in,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.880]   I brought what I thought was a lot of diverse experience to that role,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   and I sent an e-mail about an area that I was not directly responsible for,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.120]   but affected the area that I was responsible for,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.160]   and immediately got a very stern e-mail back,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.320]   effectively saying, "Stay in your lane."
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.920]   Honestly, I feel like my relationship with that manager spiraled from there.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:27.720]   I think her managerial style was to create clear autonomy for folks,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   and I tried to salvage that.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.000]   I felt really insecure about the whole thing afterwards.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.400]   I probably didn't fully consider what was happening,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.000]   but I learned a lot from it in terms of I prefer to work with teams
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.040]   in a slightly less structured way where everybody can bring ideas and expertise,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.160]   even if it crosses over the boundaries of what people are directly responsible for,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.200]   at least be considered.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:15.000]   I took from that the way I reacted super insecurely to the whole situation.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.360]   I had some work to do internally to not take that personally.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   It wasn't a personal statement about my abilities,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.720]   but it definitely shaped how I responded to her moving forward,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.000]   and I'm not proud of that.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   Yeah, I had one manager – actually, I've had a few bad managers,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.480]   and they happened to, unfortunately, be all female.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.280]   There was a time in my life where I fundamentally distrusted just female leadership.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.000]   Thankfully, that changed over time.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.600]   But this first one – I was still earlier in my career,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.800]   but this is on the agency side still,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.640]   and I've had three to four years of incredible success up to that point.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.720]   My confidence and my ability was really, really high.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   When I went to this other agency, they brought me in to do account management,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.520]   and the nature of that job, which was different than my previous agency,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.920]   was I was both the account manager and the project manager, right?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.120]   So I'm in this cycle where the more successful I am at bringing in business,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   the more scope I add to my own plate for work to manage, right?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.720]   And so there's that dynamic I was wrestling with,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.320]   and what happened was they brought me in to manage their largest accounts,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.920]   and then within a month, she went on maternity leave, right?
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.000]   And so I was managing the best that I can
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   and my escalation path for raising issues and concerns
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.120]   because I was under the belief that I was capable.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.000]   I didn't raise my hand enough. That's probably my own fault.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.600]   But what happened was when she came back,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.800]   the amount of business that our primary client gave to us
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   was not as high as what she'd expected.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.400]   And her managerial style was both directly aggressive
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.680]   in the words she would use and very, very passive-aggressive as well.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.400]   And so I was constantly dealing with self-doubt,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.200]   and she would pull me into her office and use very direct language towards me.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.400]   Now, if that would have happened now, I would have responded differently
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.000]   or maybe take more time to ask questions,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   to understand the truth behind everything she's saying.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But I didn't have the knowledge to do that.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.400]   I didn't probably even give myself permission to do that.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.000]   I think her level as a GM really intimidated me.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.400]   So I really struggled, you guys.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   I remember, there's a back in the day where cassette tapes were the thing.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:05.000]   My dad had a 10 cassette tape deck of self-help video and audio books.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   And every day when I left work,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   I would sit in the parking lot, pop in a tape and listen to it.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   And then every day before, I like how Zoom just give me a thumbs up there.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   And then I'm glad Zoom agrees with that decision.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Oh, a celebration.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Look at you. You're a star.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   That was perfect for an audio-only audience.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   But then before going to work,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   I would also have to sit in the car and listen to self-help books
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   because I was at that point where my sense of value was so low
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   that I had to seek that.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   Otherwise, I would go do work and I would break down.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   And it was just really emotionally tough for me at the time.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   And I never really handled it well.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   I ended up getting let go.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   I remember actually, when I got let go,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   that was the first time in probably a year that I actually felt relief and joy.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   My journey through unemployment after that was a little bit rough.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   But yeah, that was really, really tough.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   And it was hard for me at that moment to identify the positives out of that.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   And I think the lesson I learned in hindsight is
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   I wish I was more proactive in finding mentors to walk me through it, right,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   in absence of therapy,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   to help me understand what I could do differently,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   or maybe even help me separate the things that truly were my fault
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   versus things that were out of my control.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   But everything I attributed to my own failure.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   And so that really, really took me for a loop.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   I've been listening to you, Troy, and to you, Tim,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   talk about dealing with difficult managers.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   It makes me try to articulate how -- I want to articulate how --
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   some of this is dependent on -- my experience, anyway,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   has been dependent on my role.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   And sometimes it's been dependent on my level of experience.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   And when I was much more junior,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   I remember working for this awful import/export company
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   where I was the copywriter.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   And we worked in this warehouse.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   We were in a building in Los Angeles where they had a front area
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   with a reception desk.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   But then you walked into the team space.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   It was literally in a warehouse.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   And there was a cage, like a wire link cage,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   around the spaces where we sat in our desk.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   And then behind us were these rows and rows of large stacks of product.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   And they sold, like, vitamins and all sorts of crazy stuff.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   And we were creating marketing.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   I was creating marketing material for it.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   And the manager had actually been someone I went to high school with
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   but didn't know.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   And then inherited a large -- not a large business,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   but inherited a business.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   And he was sort of like -- everything about him made me sort of just want
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   to leave the job force forever because he was flashy.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   He was arrogant.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   It was sort of this arrogant confidence.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   And then when it came to him -- and even though he was the CEO of,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   like, a very small company, he would review all the marketing materials
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   and everything I'd written.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   And invariably the work would come back.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   Like, everything changed.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   You know, basically every sentence had, like, some sort of edit on it.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   But in retrospect, that was one of my very first jobs as a copywriter.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   You know, maybe they were appropriate edits.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   And I just took it as, like, a total and absolute criticism
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   and demonstration of how I wasn't ready.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   And maybe I needed that.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   And I needed also to know that in some cases, you know, I think you said it,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   Troy, it's about the relationship.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   And I could have -- and I don't know if I necessarily did it.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   Eventually I got laid off.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Or not laid off, but fired.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   And I remember my boss coming to me and said it was sort of like the weakest
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   link thing, which always stuck in my head as an awful way to say you didn't
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   quite make the grade.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   But, you know, I didn't somehow -- I had the connection with the CEO
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   because he had been at my high school.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   But I didn't know how to build the connection with him.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   And it's been the case in lots of different roles where, you know,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   whether or not I've been an individual contributor or a manager or, you
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   know, a partner at some of the -- I started two boutique agencies where I
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   was founder or partner.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   And so I was working directly with founders, other founders of startups,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   you know, managing directors of large companies.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   And so my boss -- they were my clients.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   And, you know, not necessarily -- it wasn't necessarily the case that any
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   of them were difficult.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   It was just they presented different challenges.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   So as an individual contributor, as I moved up, it was about understanding
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   if the feedback I got from whoever was reviewing my work, you know, how did
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   I interpret it?
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   How did I then revise?
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   How did I work with the other, you know, creatives to get the work to a
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   better space?
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   How did I assert solutions to, you know, ongoing trends in the work?
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   How did I come up with new ideas?
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   And I think as I did that, I became more successful as a contributor.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   So then when I was in a managerial role, I think I was better able to reflect
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   that back to folks I was managing and help them understand that in the best
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   case when the business is, you know, somewhat on solid footing and we're not,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   you know, losing cash or, you know, getting ready for a layoff because of,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   you know, who knows why.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Lots of different reasons for layoffs.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   And I had to understand then when I was a manager that there's a couple of
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   really important things to convey to the folks that reported to me.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   And that was, one, that I didn't think they were perfect.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   They had strengths and weaknesses.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   I wanted to lean into their strengths and help them grow over time.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   I had a manager at Logitech where we all worked, Nancy Morrison,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   who's now retired.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   And I very much remember the first week I was there, and she was describing
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   my role and expectations.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   And she said something that blew me away.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   She said, "The first year, Jesse, I want you to focus on this."
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   And I was not quite -- I was in my 30s.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   I had a lot of jobs before that.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   No one had ever said anything that suggested I would be around for that long.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   Like, not that I -- that wasn't the expectation,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   but it was never articulated so assertively.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   And it was such a positive statement, I still kind of tear up when I think
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   about it, how generous that was for her to say that.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   And I was there for a few years, and, you know, I had some -- you know,
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   and it also kind of reminds me of, in the case of Logitech,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   that sometimes it's my manager's manager that is the problem.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   And such was the case there.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   And I've been at other places where I've been in agencies where, you know,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   I've been in the rank and file, but the account folks are trying to sell stuff.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   And so they're sort of semi-managing in a sort of dotted line way to the
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   creatives because they're bringing us work.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   But often they would, you know, have, like,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   hallway conversations with the client on a Friday afternoon and say,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   "We got this great idea, and we're going to spin it up for you by Monday
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   morning," and the creatives work all weekend.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   I remember in one case this happened.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   We put together a presentation, and then Monday morning meeting comes with
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   the client, and he leans over to the account person and says,
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   "That thing I said on Friday, yeah, that was stupid.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   I hope you didn't do anything about that."
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   Meanwhile, the creatives have worked all weekend.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   So it's just -- it can be a mixed bag in terms of how to distinguish between
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   managing both your clients' and your managers' expectations.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah, you know, there are two instances,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   at least that I'm aware of because it was brought to my attention,
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   where I was the difficult manager.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   Interesting.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   The first one was actually that agency I was talking about.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   So I was able to finally get help.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   I got a project manager.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   And you would think that the project manager now, like,
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   that with half my responsibility taken off my plate,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   I should be able to thrive, and I did not.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   And she really struggled working with me.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   And she wasn't on my direct report,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   but this is the first time I had a true dotted line.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   And what I learned after the fact --
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   so she and I never had a conversation while I was employed.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   And that's, I think, mistake number one.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   As a manager, I didn't have open channel of dialogue,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   nor was I open to my own vulnerability,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   nor was I openly transparent with her.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   And I never realized that my issue was delegation.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   Like, I didn't know how to delegate work.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   And I kept stuff close to my chest.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   And maybe that was maybe in response to my fear of losing my job.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   So I wanted to hold stuff
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   to maybe increase the company's dependency on me.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   But she really struggled.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   And as a project manager, if you're not given information
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   or if you're removed from meetings with the client,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   then, like, you can't succeed as a project manager.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   And I didn't set her up for success for that one.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   And actually, I've since reached out to her afterwards and apologized
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   because that was not good.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   And I didn't realize how terrible it was for her.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   When we finally reconnected on it, she was, like, crying.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   And I had no idea that I was impacting her that much.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   The second one was maybe at Rubrik,
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   which is only two companies removed from where I am today.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   And I thought I was a good manager.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   You know, by then, this is post-LinkedIn.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.600]   I've learned all I could about compassionate and empathetic leadership.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   And I thought I was a good manager.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   And the feedback from a few folks on my team confirmed that.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   And there's this one person I brought on to run search engine marketing.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   And, you know, she replaced a previous employee.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   And she really struggled.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   And what I realized prior to her choosing to leave the company,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.600]   she told me that I didn't allow her to make decisions.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.600]   And that really boggled my mind because I was like,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   "I thought I was an empathetic leader where I'm –
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   I thought I'm empowering my individuals."
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:18.600]   And what I realized was I was drawing goals and outcomes
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   that she had no control over.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   So I was defining some benchmark that was, in hindsight, very unrealistic.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   But I wasn't – like, search engine marketing is not my primary wheelhouse.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   Like, I know enough to manage it,
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   but I definitely do not know it well enough to run them by myself.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   And the problem was I wasn't self-aware enough.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   I thought I could skate by by my knowledge of the industry.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   So I would draw goals that just did not make any sense.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   And she really struggled.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   And on top of that, she didn't have the right assets to convert with.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   So, again, I'm equipping her with the tools to succeed in paid search, right?
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   And then the metrics, the day-to-day metrics, also didn't make sense.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   Like, the benchmarks just didn't make sense.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   But, again, I thought I was bringing her in to contribute to the goal setting.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   What was happening was, in part, she was trying to scrounge together goals
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   to try to meet those KPIs, but ultimately she was set up to fail, right?
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   And it was chipping away at her sense of value
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   because she felt like she wasn't performing anymore.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   And I wasn't self-aware enough to notice that.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   And even though I was the interpersonal leader at the time, I did not do well there.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   And so when she left, similarly, she was like, "This is the hardest job I've ever had.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   And it's probably one of the worst situations she had."
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   And I was the director of all of that, right?
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   And so I learned a lot about trusting your team and knowing your limitations
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   and you're hiring people for a reason because they know something you don't, you know?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   So lead and guide, but let them do what they're good at.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   Hey, guys. Thanks again for watching and listening.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   Next week, we'll be talking about dealing with career low points.
