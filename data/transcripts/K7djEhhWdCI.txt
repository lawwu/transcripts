[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.360]   All right, let's do one more question.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.600]   We got one more question here.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.960]   This one comes from Dave.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.200]   Dave says, my wife and I have a 13-month-old child
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.400]   and would like to have another.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.920]   We're both working professionals who
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   have built substantial career capital.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.720]   So they're both mid-career professionals.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.120]   I find myself increasingly drawn to being a stay-at-home dad
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.200]   for the next five years or so while my children are young.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680]   While acknowledging that this would cause a drastic change
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.280]   in my career trajectory, do you have any advice
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.480]   on how I can continue to stay engaged and build or maintain
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.160]   career capital while taking such a long time away from work?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.040]   All right, that's an interesting question.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.520]   I wouldn't really sweat career capital maintenance,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.960]   at least at first, if you're going to shift
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.800]   to be a stay-at-home parent.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520]   That's where your focus is.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.480]   I would say in today's professional landscape,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.720]   this is much more understood than it used to be.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.280]   So if you say, I did this, this, this.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.680]   I was at this point in my career.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.800]   I have a lot of career capital.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.040]   Three years, I disappeared.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.560]   And then I came back onto the scene.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.040]   To say, yeah, I disappeared for those three years
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.580]   because I was taking care of my kids,
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760]   this is way more understood.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.000]   You don't really need a more elaborate explanation
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.760]   than that.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   Now, if you're talking about a five-year period--
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.280]   and by the way, I'm pulling these timelines out
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120]   of thin air, so don't take this too seriously.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.620]   But roughly speaking, I think if you're talking about maybe
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.520]   a five-year period, maybe around year three
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   is when you bring back in-- or year four,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   maybe you bring back in the part-time consulting,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   whatever it is, the limited engagements,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.240]   just to get your foot back in the door,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.160]   to pick up on the newer skills, to get your name back out
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.480]   there, more importantly, to help you start sniffing out
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.040]   the different opportunities so you're not just
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   trying to go for-- if you go from zero to 60,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.400]   now I need a full-time job, you might end up
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   landing in a job that's not the right setup for what you're
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.640]   looking for.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   So it allows you to get your foot back in the door,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.080]   see what's going on, test the water if you do
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   want to go back to work.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.040]   And if you do, where do you want to fall
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.600]   on the spectrum of doing your own thing as a consultant
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720]   or going back and working for a firm?
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.240]   You get a lot of good insight.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.280]   But I think for the first three years, if you can be at home,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   be at home.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.120]   And your focus should be on that.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.200]   Also, remember the whole point of career capital,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.880]   the theory laid out in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.600]   is that the whole point of career capital
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   is that it gives you something you
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   can invest to get in return traits in your career that
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   resonate.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.560]   So you have this general vision of a lifestyle
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920]   that is very appealing.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.720]   Oftentimes, the things that makes lifestyles appealing
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.040]   are themselves valuable.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.760]   So you have to have something valuable to offer in return.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.200]   So you build up rare and valuable skills.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.720]   This gives you more career capital.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.040]   You invest that capital to get more control and autonomy
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.960]   over your career.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.080]   But the whole reason you do that is
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.480]   so that you can shape your career
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.520]   towards a lifestyle that resonates.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.440]   Well, if what's resonating with you right now
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.200]   is a lifestyle where you're home with your kids,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   you've jumped to where we're trying to get.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.600]   The career capital is a means to the end of,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.120]   I have autonomously shaped a lifestyle
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.240]   that resonates with me.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   It's one of the things you can use to get there.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.600]   But if this lifestyle resonates, I
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.040]   want to be there in my kids' life
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.680]   during this young period of their age
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.000]   and be more engaged in family life and what have you,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.440]   then you are already at the end.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.840]   So you don't have to worry so much about career capital.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.960]   And then when it comes time to come back to work,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.520]   if you want to go back to work, you
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.600]   should be doing this from a lifestyle perspective.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   Oh, is there a lifestyle I have in mind here
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.680]   that work now plays a role again?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.120]   But I want to be surprised in your situation
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600]   where you're saying, I really like this lifestyle where
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.480]   I'm with my kids.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   And maybe now they're getting a little bit older.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.860]   They're in school most of the day.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.240]   And so I don't want to just be at home.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.120]   But I want to maintain a lot of the aspects
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.040]   I like of this lifestyle.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.240]   I like to be there in the mornings.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.520]   I like the fact that I can pick them up after school
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.160]   when they're done.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.700]   And I think this is really important.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.520]   But I also want something else to do.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.880]   This may lead you to a very different type of career
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.240]   trajectory than if you were just
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.280]   trying to stay on the trajectory you're on now.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.600]   Maybe this is a trajectory you're
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.360]   saying, I'm not trying to be the partner at my engineering firm.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.840]   I want 10 hours a week of consulting work
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.440]   that is interesting to me.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.240]   And because I was pretty good before I
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   put what I was doing on pause, I get a pretty good hourly rate
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.260]   for it.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.000]   And that's nice.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   And it helps me to make things a little bit more
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.680]   flexible in the household.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.480]   But it also gives me a lot of flexibility.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.440]   I mean, your whole vision might be different.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.720]   So what I'm trying to say here is
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.080]   the goal for all of this type of thinking
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.400]   is autonomously crafting a lifestyle that resonates,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.000]   that you had an idea and you made that actually happen.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.760]   That's the whole ballgame here.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   So in the professional world, if there's a particular trait
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   you want in your job, I want very flexible hours
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.900]   or a lot of money or this or that,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.780]   then career capital is really important to it.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.400]   But you're playing a bigger level here
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.840]   where job fits in there here.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.480]   But there's other things also going on.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.040]   So work backwards from the lifestyle that resonates.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   I'm reading your long elaboration here.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   You're very good at what you do.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.880]   There will be economic opportunities for you.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   If you want to get back to it after three years,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   start doing something so that you
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.280]   can get a sense of what do I really want to do.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.920]   But don't really sweat career capital in the sense of this
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.320]   in itself is the end.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.240]   Your goal is not in life to have as much career capital
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.840]   as possible.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.560]   Your goal in life is to have a life that
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.880]   is shaped as much as possible towards what you really
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.040]   care about.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.280]   Capital is one of many tools that you can deploy.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.080]   So I say go for it, man.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.880]   Get home, be there with the kids, do cool things with them,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.640]   get weird hobbies that they get involved with you with,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.520]   get to know the teachers at the school, whatever it is.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.280]   Go over the top and decorating for holidays,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   all the cool stuff you get to do when you actually
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.320]   have some time.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   And just enjoy that resonating for a while.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.200]   And then if you need to bring work back into it,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.600]   bring work back to it.
