[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   I'm now going to tell you a tool that you can use
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.060]   when you're feeling less than energized,
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.700]   less than motivated, and when you need to exercise
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.340]   and you don't feel like doing it,
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.320]   and when you want to leverage exercise
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   as a way to improve brain function and plasticity.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.080]   It all involves the vagus nerve,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   and it involves an aspect of the vagus nerve
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.200]   that very few people are aware of,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.380]   but in my opinion, is one of the coolest aspects
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.340]   of the vagus nerve.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.800]   It's at least as cool as vagal control
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.440]   over heart rate variability and auto-regulation,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.740]   and it goes like this.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.680]   There's a beautiful set of findings
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.060]   from a guy named Peter Strick at the University of Pittsburgh,
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.460]   who used these really cool methods
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.120]   for tracing connections between the brain and body
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.260]   to ask the question, what areas of the brain
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.840]   are communicating with our adrenal glands?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.480]   Our adrenal glands are two glands
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.600]   that sit atop your two different kidneys,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.680]   so one atop each kidney and release, as the name suggests,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   adrenaline.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.140]   Adrenaline is also called epinephrine.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.500]   Your adrenal glands also release cortisol,
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.420]   but for sake of this discussion,
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.320]   let's just think about adrenaline released from your adrenals.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.780]   What he found through a bunch of experiments done
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.660]   in non-human primates, and that seemed to correspond very well
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.920]   to what we observe in humans as well,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.260]   is that there are three general groups of brain areas.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.640]   Motor activation areas, so what we call upper motor neurons.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.860]   So these are the neurons in the brain that control the lower motor,
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.900]   neurons in the spinal cord that control the muscles of the body,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.100]   as well as neurons within our brain that are involved in cognition
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.220]   and planning, and areas of the brain that are involved in emotion,
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.260]   that can communicate with the adrenals
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.160]   and cause them to release adrenaline.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.100]   Now that's great, but it sort of points to a pathway whereby,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.540]   okay, you know you should exercise,
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.220]   you tell yourself you should exercise,
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.700]   you're emotional about it,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600]   and your adrenals release adrenaline and you exercise.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.740]   Now that's interesting, but what's perhaps far more interesting
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.740]   is that the data from Strick Lab and other labs as well,
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.120]   shows that when we move the large muscles of our body,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.360]   the adrenals release adrenaline, epinephrine.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.460]   Now epinephrine has an activating sympathetic nervous system,
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.740]   stimulatory effect, right?
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.380]   It tends to make the tissues of the body that are associated
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.080]   with movement and with so-called fight or flight,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800]   although again, fight or flight is kind of an extreme example,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.300]   it tends to activate the organs of the body
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.440]   and make them more likely to be active.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   It increases the probability that movement will occur,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   overall body movement.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.700]   So when we move the large muscles of our body,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.920]   our legs, and in particular our trunk muscles,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.960]   we release adrenaline,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.600]   that adrenaline activates the organs of our body
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.080]   and further makes it likely
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.780]   that we're going to move our musculature more.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.980]   But get this,
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.460]   adrenaline, epinephrine doesn't cross the blood brain barrier.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.700]   So how does it increase our level of alertness in our brain,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.540]   right?
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.480]   You don't want your body to be super active
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   and your brain to be kind of sleepy.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.040]   That's not good.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.760]   That's not adaptive.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.340]   It turns out that when the adrenals release adrenaline,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.540]   it binds to receptors on the vagus nerve itself,
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.060]   those sensory axons that extend into the body.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.220]   There are receptors on those wires, right?
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.000]   Not all the receptors are at one end or the other,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.620]   they're also on those axons.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.020]   The adrenaline binds to the receptors on those axons
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.640]   and the vagus nerve in turn releases glutamate,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   an excitatory neurotransmitter in a structure in the brain
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.540]   called the nucleus tractus solitaris.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.580]   The neurons in what I'm just going to call the NTS
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.160]   for simplicity, in turn, activate neurons in a brain structure
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.300]   called the locus coeruleus.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.720]   The locus coeruleus contains neurons that release
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   what's called norepinephrine.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.020]   And the neurons of locus coeruleus send their axons out
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.980]   very extensively across the brain
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.960]   in kind of a sprinkler system-like organization,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   such that when you move the large musculature of your body,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.140]   you release adrenaline.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.480]   That adrenaline activates the tissues of your body,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.840]   makes them more likely to move,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.080]   also binds to receptors on the vagus.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.220]   The vagus nerve in turn releases glutamate,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.640]   an excitatory neurotransmitter in the NTS.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.780]   The NTS then passes off that excitatory signal,
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.900]   like a bucket brigade off to the locus coeruleus.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.500]   The locus coeruleus dumps a bunch of norepinephrine into the brain
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.740]   and increases your levels of alertness.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.780]   What this means is that the vagus nerve is central to the process
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.700]   of using physical activity to make your brain more alert.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.780]   And we know that activation of locus coeruleus makes the brain areas
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.260]   that are involved in motivation and the propensity to move more
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.580]   higher in levels of activity.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.620]   In other words, if you're not feeling motivated to exercise,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.080]   or you're not feeling alert enough,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.560]   movement of the body that includes especially the legs,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.840]   the large muscles of the legs,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.720]   the quadriceps, hamstrings, et cetera,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.020]   as well as the trunk muscles of the body,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.700]   stimulate this pathway in a kind of dominoing effect
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.920]   that makes the likelihood and believe it or not,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.560]   the desire to move much more likely.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.380]   This I've personally found to be an immensely useful piece
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.540]   of information because sure,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.720]   I knew that sometimes I would go to the gym
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.880]   or I'd head out on a run and I wasn't feeling motivated,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.340]   or I'd sit down to do some work and I'd feel kind of sleepy,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.320]   despite the fact that I had slept pretty well the night before
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.500]   and eaten just fine and the room wasn't too warm, et cetera.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.560]   And I feel kind of lethargic.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.660]   And I was like, what's going on here?
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.120]   And yes, I had the experience of sometimes, you know,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.540]   doing a bit of a warmup, maybe some light calisthenics,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.060]   maybe a few warmup sets or jogging for a little while,
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.600]   and then finding that my levels of alertness increased.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.500]   But I've also had just as often the experience of not feeling
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.100]   that motivation for physical activity
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.420]   or for cognitive activity come online,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.320]   especially if I wasn't extremely interested in that activity
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.200]   or that thing that I was supposed to learn.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.820]   You know, it's very easy to be excited
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.200]   when we want to do the activity or we want to learn the thing
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   that we're supposed to be learning at a given moment
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.660]   or reading at a given moment.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.620]   This pathway is immensely useful to understand
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.940]   because it explains why it is that even when you're not feeling motivated,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.880]   if you do some activity that, yes, is preceded by a bit of a warmup.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.800]   So maybe, I don't know, you do some light calisthenics
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.600]   or you go on the treadmill for a few minutes walking,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.580]   then maybe a little bit faster,
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.780]   that it can increase your levels of alertness and motivation.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.740]   But it especially explains how if you put in some effort that at the moment feels like a big exertion,
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.240]   your entire body and brain state shifts in a way that levels of motivation and energy to do more physical work
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.680]   or more cognitive work or both increases dramatically.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840]   And these are not small effects when they've been measured.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.360]   In fact, for all the talk that's out there in kind of pop psychology and in kind of pop neuroscience
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.640]   about the vagus being a calming pathway, all the neurophysiologists out there,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.840]   and I know there aren't very many, but I'm friends with a lot of neurophysiologists,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.340]   they'll all tell you that if they're doing a surgery or they're doing some sort of brain recording
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.760]   and the animal or person that they're doing the brain recording from
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.420]   is starting to drop into a state of deep parasympathetic activity,
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.360]   they're falling asleep or they need to be more alert, what do they do?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.980]   They stimulate the vagus.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.920]   They stimulate the vagus nerve in order to wake up the brain.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.240]   In fact, stimulating the vagus has been used to save people's lives
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.920]   when they are drifting too far down into deeper and deeper planes of anesthesia.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.120]   So stimulating the vagus wakes up the brain.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.700]   And the way to stimulate the vagus is by way of these receptors on the vagus nerve itself.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.600]   And the way to do that without an electrical stimulator, right?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.180]   Because we're not talking about clinical conditions here,
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.700]   in order to increase levels of motivation, alertness, and focus for physical activity
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   or cognitive activity and learning, et cetera,
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.500]   or simply to overcome lethargy and brain fog,
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.640]   is to do some sort of physical activity that includes the large musculature of your body.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.680]   These could be things like jumping.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.700]   These could be things like actual resistance training.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.640]   This could be running.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.900]   This information really points to the idea of, of course, after a good warmup,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.820]   doing more sprinting type activity, more strength type activity,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.020]   you know, six repetitions or less where you're getting close to failure,
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.160]   this sort of thing to wake up the brain and body,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.420]   as opposed to doing long rhythmic activity that's below the threshold
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.040]   of what would activate a lot of adrenaline from the adrenals.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.540]   So the idea is to get those adrenals to release adrenaline into your system.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.060]   It won't cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.800]   but your vagus nerve provides this beautiful link
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.920]   between the body and brain to match levels of excitation
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.980]   from the body to the brain, and you can leverage that.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:38.040]   So the idea is to get those adrenals to the body.
