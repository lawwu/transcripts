[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220]   If you'd been sitting in that time and you had known the Industrial Revolution was coming,
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.980]   or you had thought it might be, and you had asked yourself what you could be doing, one
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.780]   answer you might have given is you might have said, "Gosh, if this happens, whatever country
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.140]   it happens in might be just like disproportionately influential."
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.940]   And what would be great is if I could help transform the thinking and the culture in
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.400]   that country to have a better handle on human rights and more value on human rights and
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.980]   individual liberties and a lot of other stuff.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.180]   And gosh, it kind of looks like people were doing that.
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.780]   And it kind of looks like it worked out.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.940]   It's like someone's thinking through, "Hey, I'm thinking about this sort of esoteric question
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.240]   about what a government owes to its citizens or when a citizen has a right to overthrow
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.860]   a government or when it's acceptable to enforce certain beliefs and not."
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.620]   And it's like the other person in the dialogue is just like, "This is the weirdest, most
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.720]   esoteric question.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   Why does this matter?
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.060]   Why aren't you helping poor people?"
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.180]   But these are the questions that the Enlightenment thinkers were thinking about.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.380]   And I think there is a good case that they came up with a lot of stuff that really shaped
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.380]   the whole world since then.
