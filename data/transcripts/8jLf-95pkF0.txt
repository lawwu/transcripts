[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:10.840]   I and many listeners of this podcast are obsessed with dopamine and what is dopamine? How does it
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.200]   work? We all hear that dopamine is this molecule associated with pleasure. I think the term
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.740]   dopamine hits, like I'm getting a dopamine hit from this, from Instagram or from likes or from
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.380]   praise or from whatever is now commonly heard. What is dopamine and what are maybe some things
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.700]   about dopamine that most people don't know and probably that I don't know either?
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.320]   So dopamine is a neurotransmitter and neurotransmitters are those molecules that
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.580]   bridge the gap between two neurons. So they essentially allow one neuron, the presynaptic
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.260]   neuron to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron. Dopamine is intimately associated with
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.320]   the experience of reward, but also with movement, which I think is really interesting because
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.980]   movement and reward are linked, right? If you think about, you know, early humans, you had
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.360]   to move in order to go seek out the water or the meat or whatever it was. And even in the
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   most primitive organisms, dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment. For
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.460]   example, C. elegans, a very primitive worm. So dopamine is this really powerful, important
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.380]   molecule in the brain that helps us experience pleasure. It's not the only neurotransmitter involved
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.240]   in pleasure, but it's a really, really important one. And if you want to think about something that
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.000]   most people don't know about dopamine, which I think is really interesting is that we are always
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.580]   releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate. And it's really the deviation from that baseline
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.440]   rather than like hits of dopamine in a vacuum that make a difference. So when we experience pleasure,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.400]   our dopamine release goes above baseline. And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.140]   And then we experience a kind of pain. Interesting. So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.420]   dopamine, how frequently we are releasing dopamine in the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food or
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.860]   experience just sitting, being, is that associated with how happy somebody is, their kind of baseline of
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.600]   happiness or level of depression? There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed may indeed
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:48.000]   have lower tonic levels of dopamine. So that's a really reasonable thought. And there's some evidence
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.680]   to suggest that that may be true. The other thing that we know, and this is, you know, really kind of
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:04.240]   what, what the book is about, is that if we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.260]   repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway, that we can change our tonic
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.840]   baseline and actually lower it over time as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.880]   which is more really than we were designed to, to experience.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.180]   Interesting. And is it would, is it, um, the case that our baseline levels of dopamine are set by our genetics,
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.120]   by our heredity?
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.060]   Well, I think, you know, if you think about sort of, you know, the early stages of development in infancy,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.900]   certainly that is true. You're kind of, you know, born with probably whatever is your baseline level,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.780]   but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact on where your, your dopamine level ultimately settles
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.180]   out. So, um, if somebody's disposition is one of, um, constant excitement and anticipation or easily excited,
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.760]   these are, I think about the kind of people where you say, "Hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos?"
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.200]   and they're like, "Yeah, that'd be great." And other people are, um, a little more cynical, harder to budge,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.400]   like my bulldog Costello, um, very, very stable, low levels of dopamine with big inflections in his case.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:27.480]   Um, is that, do you think that's a set in terms of, um, our parents and obviously nature and nurture interact,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.920]   but is that, is dopamine at the core of our temperament?
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.480]   I don't really think we know the answer to that, but I will say that people are definitely born
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.280]   with different temperaments and those temperaments do affect their ability to experience joy. Um,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.920]   and, and, you know, we've known that for a long time and we described that in many different ways.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.800]   One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era is to use psychiatric nomenclature,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.320]   like this person has a dysthymic temperament, or, you know, this person has chronic major depressive
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.520]   disorder. Um, in terms of looking specifically at who's vulnerable to addiction, um, that's an
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.280]   interesting sort of mixed bag because when you look at, uh, the research on risk factors for
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   addiction, so what kind of temperament, uh, of a person makes them more vulnerable to addiction,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   you see, um, some interesting findings. First, you see that people who are more impulsive
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.720]   are more vulnerable to addiction. So what is impulsivity? That means having difficulty, um,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.040]   putting space between the thought or desire to do something and actually doing it. And people who have
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.600]   difficulty putting a space there who are, who have a thought to do something and just do it
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   impulsively are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.280]   Interesting. Could I, uh, in terms of impulsivity, is this something that relates literally to,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.320]   um, the startle reflex? Like I, for instance, as a, uh, lab director, I'm familiar with walking around
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.800]   my lab. And, um, when I decide deciding I'm going to talk to my people, of course, when they knock on my
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.560]   door, it's always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now? Even though I love to talk to them,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.320]   but I walk around my lab from time to time and some people I notice I'll say, um,
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   do you have a moment? And they'll slowly turn around and say, yeah, or no, in some cases.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.200]   Um, and other people will jump the moment I say their name, they actually have a,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.320]   uh, a kind of a heightened, um, startle reflex. Right.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.520]   Is that related to impulsivity or is what you're referring to, um, an attempt to, uh,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.920]   withhold behavior that's very deliberate under very deliberate conditions?
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.120]   Yeah. So I don't think that that startle reflex is, is necessarily related to impulsivity. That,
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.240]   that can be related to anxiety. So people who are high anxiety, people will tend to have more
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   of a startle reflex. Impulsivity is a little bit different. And by the way, impulsivity is not always
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.600]   bad, right? Um, impulsivity is, is that thing where there's not a lot of self editing or worrying about
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   future consequences. You know, you have the idea to do something and you do it. And of course we can
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.080]   imagine many scenarios where that's absolutely wonderful. Um, you know, there can be a sort of,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.520]   uh, let's say intimate, um, interactions between people where you wouldn't really want to be super
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.880]   inhibited about it. Right. You would want to be disinhibited and, and impulsive. Um, there, I can also
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.440]   like imagine like sort of, um, fight or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios, right. Where, where it would
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.720]   really be good to be impulsive and just go, rah, you know, just where hesitation can cost you your life.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.120]   Yes, that's right. That's right. But you know, and I think this brings up a really,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:48.840]   something that I've come to believe after 25 years of practicing psychiatry is that what we now
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:59.160]   conceptualize in our current ecosystem as mental illness are actually traits that in another ecosystem
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.240]   might be very advantageous. They're just not advantageous right now because of the world that
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.760]   we live in. And, and I think, you know, impulsivity is potentially one of those, right.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   Cause we live in this world that's sort of like, you have to, um, constantly be thinking
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:24.440]   sort of rationally about the consequences of X, Y, or Z. And it's such a sensory rich environment,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.280]   right. That we're being bombarded with all of these opportunities, these sensory opportunities,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.840]   and we have to constantly check ourselves. And so, so, so impulsivity is something that
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.080]   right now, um, can be a difficult trait, but isn't in and of itself a bad thing.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.880]   I see. Yeah.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.360]   Yeah. And it's, I, I'm beginning to realize it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:54.760]   Yeah.
