[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Hysteria, cynicism, scandal, and tweet storms.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   American politics right now is a hot mess.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.120]   Political clashes are public, polarized, and prolonged.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.600]   But if it feels like we're living through an ideological civil war, this experience
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   is not unique to our time or to this country.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.940]   But many younger Christians have been spared this cultural experience until now.
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.260]   So what does it mean for the church?
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.680]   How do we walk careful not to fan the flames of political animosity?
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.280]   If we get embroiled in heated political debates online or even in face-to-face conversations
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.840]   with others, what is the cost on our evangelistic priorities and our culture?
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.400]   More generally, perhaps we should ask, are Christians too deeply embedded in American
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.320]   culture already, as some have recently suggested?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.600]   I pose these questions to Dr. Don Carson, co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   from his home office.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   He shared with me his thoughts.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   Here's what he said.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.280]   Well, that's a good but complex question.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   You're right, first of all, to point out that this has happened before.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.780]   This is a particularly intense one.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.440]   For example, during the first year and a half or so of the Second World War, before America
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.200]   was involved, after Pearl Harbor, there was huge division in this country between those
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.240]   who thought that we should get into the war and those who thought we should not.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.920]   And if Pearl Harbor hadn't happened, it's hard to imagine how America would easily have
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   got into the war.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.320]   And there have been other times that have been equally polarized, with no restraint
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.480]   whatsoever on the name-calling and so on.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.800]   So from a historical perspective, this is not unknown, but it is particularly intense
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.600]   now partly because of some of the personalities involved and partly because the diverse political
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   opinions are so convinced that each is right.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.800]   There is very little sort of even-handed weighing of things and tradition now of polarization
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.200]   in Congress that means there are only winners and losers.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   Whereas when Reagan was in power, for example, although he was pretty much on the conservative
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   side, he knew how to work with people from the opposite party.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.920]   And that sometimes assured that he was considered a compromiser by people on the right.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.440]   But in fact, he got many things done and steered a whole country precisely because he knew
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.320]   how to win people.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.920]   Whereas as long as both sides are thinking almost exclusively in terms of winning and
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.880]   losing, then what you generate is self-righteousness, fear, hatred, a conquest mentality, and not
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.640]   the kind of political compromise that actually gets things through both houses of Congress.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.300]   So you combine that with any sort of narcissistic attitude and it's really hard to find leaders
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.040]   who are simultaneously strong and humble.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.320]   That's part of the background in which we find ourselves.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   So what would I say then to Christians?
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.780]   First, it really is very important to remember constantly that Christians don't live here
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.980]   or we live here but don't belong here.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.240]   This world is not my home.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.560]   I'm just passing through.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   And the old Negro spiritual, I'm just crossing over Jordan.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.880]   Some people have charged those spirituals with a kind of escapism.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.120]   I don't think it's escapism.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   I think that that view of the eternal realities that await us position us to relativize the
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.680]   absolutes of our day and position us to endure and grow strong.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   If all you have to live for, if all that is valuable takes place in the political world
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   right now, then you understand why it becomes absolute.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.800]   But if political issues are important because people are important and you want to do what's
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   right and what's good and what's best for the country and for the world, for the people
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   that you govern and so on, yes, that's right.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   But if you also have this larger perspective that you want to get people ready to meet
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.480]   God and that this life is not all there is, then that relativizes the intensity with which
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   you have any right to invest your energy into the political process.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.280]   I think that one of the good things that could come out of this is that some Christians,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   both on the left and on the right, have identified their Christianity with a particular political
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.160]   party.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.840]   On the right, often in terms of freedom, in terms of a certain vision of prosperity, in
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.720]   terms of the primacy of God-centered fear and so on.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   On the left, in terms of concern for the poor, in terms of concern for social justice.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.600]   Again, on each side, as each side understands those terms.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.640]   If you identify your whole being with those ideals and then produce policies that you
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   think will bring them about, then the political voice that is heard from both sides is, "Follow
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.400]   my policies and we'll bring you to the promised land.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.680]   Follow my policies and we'll have at last peace and justice and accord and maturity
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   and so on."
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.400]   And when each side talks of learning to cooperate with me, what they mean is, "Capsize your
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   own views and just follow me."
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.360]   And it's much more mature in a two-party democratic system to recognize that for the devout Christian
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.160]   whose ethical and moral cues are taken from Holy Scripture, no matter which party you
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200]   align with, there are going to be some things you like and some things you don't like.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.880]   Even in the best of times, you sort of hold your nose a bit at this particular element
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.120]   of the party versus that particular element of the party.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.920]   And if you don't hold your nose, then probably your cue is being taken from the party rather
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.040]   than from Scripture.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.880]   Scripture stands over against all parties.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:27.440]   And now because of the shape of the argument today, it's probably easier to see that Christians
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.880]   to participate in the political system means that there is a little bit of holding your
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.080]   nose while you try to pursue the stance of the party that you think is going to do most
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.560]   good and least harm and try to nudge the party toward a position that is more honorable and
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.760]   more God-fearing and so forth.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.720]   The next thing that needs to be said is that as the culture itself becomes more distanced
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.000]   from any sort of Judeo-Christian heritage in the past, I mean, when I was a boy, everybody
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.240]   knew the Ten Commandments.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.000]   When I was a boy, Bible teaching at school was not uncommon.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.440]   That was in Canada, which is now more secular than most of the U.S.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:19.960]   And today, the notion that your subdivision had a lot of Christian values in it, it seems
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.040]   quaint, archaic, out of touch.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.120]   And as a result, people have been advocating something that is increasingly called the
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.580]   Benedict Option.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.600]   It's named after Benedict, who started an order, a monastery, and so on, a kind of withdrawal
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.700]   from society to live differently.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.100]   And there is a sense in which every local church that is trying to square with Scripture
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.960]   is pursuing the Benedict Option, although it's not named that particularly.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.060]   That is to constitute a culture that is a bit different.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.300]   So we shouldn't be thinking exactly the same thing as the world around us about iPhones
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.460]   or Oscars or economics or almost anything.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.780]   Social, sexual mores, what you do with your money, what advancement looks like, what success
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.380]   looks like, what human flourishing looks like, what kind of jokes you listen to.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.220]   There is a sense in which instead of having a Judeo-Christian heritage all around us in
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:21.560]   which we're playing a slightly more righteous part and preaching the gospel, we're increasingly
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.260]   dealing with, especially in the most secular parts of the country, an essentially alien
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.260]   society.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.180]   And then it's important for not just the individual Christian, but for the Christian church, the
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.340]   Christian community to live differently.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:42.060]   And that needs to be thought through and worked out much more systematically than it has been.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:48.700]   And then beyond all of that, the place of evangelism in all of this just cannot be lost.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:55.220]   You cannot evangelize people you don't love, whether they're from the opposite party or
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.700]   from the opposite gender or from a different race or from a different religion, including
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.700]   Islam.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.500]   We have to relearn the ability to disagree with people and still do it in such a way
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.460]   that we're not simply being rude and obstreperous and hate-mongering.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:22.420]   And that which we learn in evangelism needs to be suffused through all of our human relationships,
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.260]   including our political relationships, so that we are honorable people.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.500]   We are not merely name-calling people.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.980]   People, when we disagree with them, need to be aware that the Jesus who can denounce some
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:41.940]   people, as in Matthew 23, because of the damage that they are doing, yet ends up at the end
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.980]   of the chapter weeping over the city.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.660]   We must be known as people who weep over our Jerusalem.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:54.260]   And that means a certain humility of mind, a certain compassion, a certain eternal view,
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:00.460]   absolutely convinced that the most good that we can ever do to anyone, any family, is to
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.380]   lead them to Christ Jesus.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.020]   And even if we win all the political debates and lose that, all we're doing is guaranteeing
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:13.980]   a self-righteous community that is on the brink of hell in any case.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.540]   So first things first, first things first, and still maintain clarity and commitment
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.460]   to the gospel and to the Christ of the gospel.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.940]   Yeah, very good.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.940]   We live here.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.940]   We belong here.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.940]   I love that.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.940]   Amen.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.420]   Briefly, I'd like to underline something that you said or seemed to imply in what you just
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.540]   said.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.180]   We have a form of the Benedict Option in play for us already.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.700]   It's called the local church.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.100]   It's a place where Christians pull away from the world for a time to gather as a society
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.740]   of fellow believers, there to be recalibrated by God's Word and to be spiritually recharged
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.180]   in order that we might re-enter the world on mission.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.500]   Is that essentially what you implied?
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.220]   I mean, there's a sense in which the Benedict Option is being treated as something new,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.220]   but it's not.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.420]   Even at sort of the social level, quite apart from distinctively evangelical commitments,
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.020]   there's a sense in which the Benedict Option is precisely what the Amish did, but they
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:20.140]   did it in certain ways that look to most of us like escapism or so withdrawing from the
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.780]   world, that you're not doing the world any good.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:29.940]   Whereas what we need are churches that are not following the dip-tat of the world and
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:37.740]   its agenda and culture and entertainment modes and how you use cell phones and whatever,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.760]   but at the same time is engaged with the world.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.060]   We need to be different from the world, but engaged with the world.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.940]   And that's not comfortable, but it seems to me essentially Christian, and it's what Christians
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.340]   have to do in the first century, the second century, the third century.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.700]   It's what Christians have done whenever the world has stood over against it, but the churches
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.700]   maintain the commitment of the gospel and to evangelism.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.500]   Yeah, essentially Christian.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.500]   Amen.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.980]   Thank you, Dr. Carson, and thanks for listening to this special episode of the Ask Pastor
