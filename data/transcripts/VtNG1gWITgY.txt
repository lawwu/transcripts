[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.880]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720]   I think your reading habits are super inspiring.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.760]   And I'm glad to say I've been able to adopt them
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.680]   in my own life.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.280]   I am currently on my fifth book of the month, which
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.880]   is really satisfying.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.560]   But one practical health-related question--
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.160]   I went to the eye doctor recently.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.600]   And the first thing the doctor said was, oh, do you read a lot?
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   Because it was apparent in the physiology of my eyeballs
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   that my eyes are pretty strained.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.640]   And so I know that you like to read during your breaks
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   from work, which suggests that you spend a lot of time
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.400]   reading, both for work and then for pleasure or otherwise.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.280]   So how do you keep your eyes healthy while still reading
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.520]   at such a great clip?
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.040]   Thanks.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.720]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.080]   Even if you're reading five books a month,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.480]   the amount of time you're looking at a book
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.000]   compared to the amount of time you're looking at a computer
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   screen for your normal job, assuming you're a knowledge
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.680]   worker type, it's still minuscule.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.960]   And the strain of looking at a computer monitor or a phone
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   is much greater than the strain of looking at a matte-printed
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.680]   ink on paper.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.640]   So partially, I'm going to say, don't worry about reading
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060]   is going to be the thing that is going to cause the issues,
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.900]   because it's probably much more strain the seven hours a day
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.920]   you probably have to look at computer screens
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.360]   than it is reading.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   That being said, the two rules that help with reading is--
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   well, actually, let me add a third.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040]   Number one, do it on paper when you can.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.120]   Don't do it on your phone.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.040]   Don't do it on tablet.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.640]   The backlight screen is more straining on your eyes.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   I count Kindle as paper, by the way.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.760]   It is paper.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.120]   The technology in Kindle, just from a physiological
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.480]   experience of reading, is the same,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.840]   because the technology in Kindle is not a screen,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   like you would have on a laptop.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.140]   It's not pixels that have light go into them.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.300]   That's what strains you when you look at a computer,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.600]   is you have all this-- it's light.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.340]   It's pixels that have light, and the light
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.200]   is a particular color.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080]   The e-ink technology in a Kindle is actually
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.880]   a bunch of little disks.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.560]   And one side's black, and one side is white, give or take.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.520]   And they shock it.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   You can put a little bit of electricity to the disk.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.960]   You can flip it over.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.760]   But once you've take the electricity away,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400]   it's a physical thing.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.760]   You're looking at physical little pieces of plastic
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.000]   that are black on one side and white on the other that
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.620]   have been arranged, flipped in a pattern that looks like words.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.560]   So it's actually, from an eye physiology perspective,
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.640]   the same as looking at words printed on a piece of paper.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.440]   You can put a light on your Kindle like you would on a book,
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040]   but you're looking at just a physical surface that
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400]   has some black and some white pieces.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.280]   So a Kindle is not going to strain your eyes
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.520]   any more than a book.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.920]   Number two, have enough light.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   You strain your eyes if you read low light.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.680]   And three, use reading glasses if you feel the strain.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.760]   Those of us who have lived an intellectual life,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.480]   we typically do need reading glasses earlier.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.360]   I'm 39, but I still have to--
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.640]   in low light situations, I have to use reading glasses.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.760]   So use reading glasses.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.520]   Have lots of light.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.560]   Stay away from backlit screens when you read,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.360]   and you'll be fine.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   But in general, I'm going to say I'm
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.320]   letting reading off the hook here, because the seven
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.360]   hours you're on Zoom has got to be worse than the one hour you
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.600]   spent that day reading and rereading my books, which
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.160]   I assume, by the way, is what you're doing.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.920]   That's what I recommend.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.540]   You just go through my books in order,
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.200]   just a cycle again and again.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680]   All right, let's see here.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.240]   Am I old?
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.440]   You don't wear reading glasses, do you, Jesse?
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   I don't wear reading glasses, but I got LASIK.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.960]   So I used to wear glasses when I drive at night.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.560]   But now I don't really have to do that.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.680]   Does LASIK work for you?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.600]   Yeah, it worked great.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   I should do that.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.480]   And my father job paid for it.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.160]   Here's my question about LASIK.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.680]   How do people do without it?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.480]   How do people do long-term camping or adventure outdoor
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.680]   trips or something like this?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.480]   I occasionally get invited on these things,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.560]   like let's go hike the whatever, Machu Picchu
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.520]   or something like that.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.840]   And how do you do these long trips
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.240]   if you have contacts or glasses?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.880]   It seems like it would be impossible, right?
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   I guess you could have glasses you could wear.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.240]   But anyways, I should do LASIK because I've
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.080]   thought about that.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.200]   I can't do long-term camping trips or this or that
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.000]   because I wear contacts.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   I can't deal with contacts in the woods.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.720]   I'm sure a lot of people do those trips
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.960]   or in the same boat as you.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.120]   And they probably haven't figured it out.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.280]   So you probably figured that out.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.240]   But in terms of getting LASIK, I thought it was great.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   And it's seamless.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   It's like a 10-minute procedure.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.600]   I should do that.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   I should do that.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.080]   Or wear complicated glasses, like blue plastic,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.040]   awesome Warby Parker glasses.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.880]   I think that would be--
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.920]   - Rec specs from back in the day, like NBA games?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.520]   - Yeah, I'm gonna wear, who was it that used
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.000]   to wear the rec specs?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.280]   It wasn't Magic Johnson, was it?
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.480]   It was, someone classically wore those.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   - Kareem?
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.640]   - Kareem, yes.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   I'm gonna wear Kareem rec specs on air,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.760]   just so people think I'm more athletic.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   And a sweatband.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.960]   Be good.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.200]   - All right, where are we at?
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.840]   That's four, do we have another call?
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.760]   - That's all the questions we have for today's show.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040]   - All right, well, excellent.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.520]   So we end on a high note.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.560]   I'm gonna start wearing rec specs and a sweatband
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   so that everyone thinks that I am more athletic than I am.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.160]   Or complicated blue plastic glasses
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.080]   so everyone will think I'm smarter.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.560]   I can just depend on what I'm trying to go on.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   Have you seen, not to go on this thing,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.960]   but if you live in a city and you're around 30-year-olds
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   who are overeducated and aren't beaten down
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.520]   by having families yet,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.480]   there's so much care in glassware and facial hair
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.400]   at this point that there's an arms race
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.080]   of who can have the more complicated, weird glasses.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.760]   - Yeah, glasses are a big thing.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.880]   There's so many different styles.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.720]   I see them all the time.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.560]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.800]   But what I can't stop thinking about
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.760]   and I'm laughing about is,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.680]   you were talking about Zuckerberg
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.800]   and his master plan to have everybody
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.240]   having all these devices and glass.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.720]   And I can just see you're already wearing
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.640]   Rex-Mex going forward.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.600]   - Yeah, but this is the technological threshold
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.400]   that has to be passed for this to be the case
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   is the glasses have to look good.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.680]   All right, so this was the problem with Google Glass
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.840]   is that if you walked around in those Google Glass,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.280]   otherwise very respectable people,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.840]   you know, it's an elementary school teacher
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   on the way back from church,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.680]   it just would feel the urge to punch you.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.000]   You just see someone with those things on,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.960]   you're like, I just wanna knock this guy over.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.080]   This is crazy.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.120]   You are like a dork goblin and like you should be injured.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.560]   So like the technology has, these have to look better,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.120]   but we'll cross that.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.520]   I think we'll cross that bridge.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.080]   Like they're gonna miniaturize these more and more.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.240]   It's gonna look better.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.360]   But it is inevitable 'cause it is just so much cheaper.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.640]   I just don't see how we're gonna avoid a future
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.840]   in which almost all of our interactions
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.280]   with visual technological interfaces will be virtual.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.120]   It's gonna be, I mean,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.600]   'cause I did this thing for the New Yorker last month
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000]   where I was working in VR.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.040]   And there's this product called Immersed
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   that's kind of winning the work in VR war right now.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.400]   And their whole thing was don't focus on collaboration
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.920]   because people don't wanna put on a helmet
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   to have a meeting.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   They just wanna go on the Zoom.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.920]   Like find a way to make people's everyday work
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.120]   somehow enhanced by using virtual reality.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.400]   And the thing they figured out is that focus
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.200]   on tech type first and give them more screens.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.080]   Tech types love screens, right?
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.680]   They want multiple monitors.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.920]   And so if you use Immersed, you can have five monitors.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.720]   And they're all being powered by your actual machines,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   right, but in the virtual world,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.240]   you can have up to five monitors.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.840]   And I did this, I worked on it.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.200]   They're sharp and they're huge.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.000]   You can drag them, put them wherever you want.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.640]   And you can have like five big screen TV size monitors
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.320]   in this virtual world.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.800]   And it really does feel like you're looking
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.640]   at a big screen TV.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.680]   The resolution is there, it looks fine.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.160]   And now you can have your code over here
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.600]   and your email here and your bug tracker over here.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.480]   And it's literally better than their real world setup
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.280]   because it's more monitors.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.640]   And that is how, see, that's the trend.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.760]   So you can have in this virtual reality world,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.120]   those monitors, so the tech is there.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   So now once you can have those monitors
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.000]   with an unobtrusive Google Glass type thing
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.720]   that does not make nice old women wanna punch you,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.080]   so they get the look right.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.560]   Why buy the monitors?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.640]   Like it's literally gonna be,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.040]   because in the virtual world,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.320]   you have to wear the big headset,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   but the thing you see in the virtual world is like,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.280]   why do I need to own a monitor?
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.240]   You can watch YouTube or movies in the virtual world.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.360]   I don't know if you've done this before.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   It's a movie theater size screen.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.320]   And it feels like it.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.920]   Like here is this giant screen,
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.360]   I'm sitting here and it's in a giant dome.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.920]   And it's like 10 feet away from me.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   And it's huge.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.560]   So again, people don't wanna put a headset on
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.400]   that covers their eyes.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.200]   But if I have my glasses I'm wearing anyways,
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.400]   can put that screen, why would I buy one?
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.680]   Like, I don't think people realize
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.640]   like how close we are to the singularity.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.720]   That like, there's a certain tipping point
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.440]   beyond which basically all these factories
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   go out of business.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.240]   And it's just gonna be one factory
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.560]   that makes these things.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.920]   Anyways, that's another point.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.160]   But I think people don't realize the degree
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.520]   to which our world is about to be a lot more virtual.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.640]   I don't know if that's, there's good parts of that
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.480]   and bad parts to it.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.640]   - Snow Crash.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.320]   - It's gonna be, yeah, Snow Crash,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.240]   but without like as many sophisticated.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.600]   So here's the thing about Snow Crash,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.920]   but you're reading it now, Jesse, I know.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.520]   It's like, because like Stevenson's like a,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.200]   kind of a cool, smart guy,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.800]   all the characters are so like steampunk,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.000]   techno, sophisticated, cool,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   and like having these rat-a-tat-tat dialogues
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.200]   and it's like these interesting artistic figures.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.080]   And in these early metaverse things,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.040]   they're always have like interesting haircuts
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   and it's always, there's a little punk in it.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.680]   And there's, you know, dyed mohawks and weird leather.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.440]   And it's like this really cool,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.200]   I think the author's the one who imagines like,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.520]   yeah, we're gonna be these like cutting edge,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.840]   avant-garde steampunk digital nerds,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.000]   but not, but awesome.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.560]   And it's not gonna be the case.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.520]   It's gonna be, you know, out of shape guys
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.720]   in their American giant hooded sweatshirt
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.440]   that is wanna watch YouTube on a bigger screen.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.640]   (laughs)
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.560]   It's not the reality, avant-garde is not cool.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.680]   Immersed is used by a bunch of programmer nerds
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.000]   who had to work remotely because of the pandemic
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.600]   and said, my monitors are at my office, you know?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.360]   And so they can put on their headset
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.240]   and get their monitors back.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.640]   It's like never as cool as the Gibson or Stevenson's
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.400]   of the world predict it's gonna be.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.040]   (upbeat music)
