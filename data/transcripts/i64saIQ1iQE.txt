[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.360]   the Gospel according to Saint John in the first chapter and the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.920]   The seventeenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:28.400]   "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   Now we've been considering this verse a number of Sunday mornings and we've been doing so
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.400]   for one fundamental and primary reason, and that is that we can only appreciate truly
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.600]   and as we should the benefits and the blessings of the Christian salvation as we realize what
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   it has done to us with respect to our position face to face with the law of God.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.600]   We have seen, I think, quite clearly that it is our failure to understand the function
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   of the law and to experience the work of the law in us and upon us that accounts in very
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   large measure for our failure to thank God and to praise him as we ought for all that
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.600]   he has done for us by grace in and through his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.400]   And in order to bring out that point clearly, we have been dealing with it like this.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.880]   There is a tendency, first of all, to dismiss the law.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.840]   This is particularly the danger confronting those of us who are evangelical Christians.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.520]   We are so concerned about not only believing but safeguarding the doctrine of justification
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.360]   by faith only that we tend to think that the only way to do that is to dismiss the law,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.120]   to get rid of it altogether and to say that now that Christ has come and has done his
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   work that the law is no longer needed and therefore it should never be considered at
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   all.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   We have seen how this happens in evangelism, that there is no interest in repentance, no
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.920]   interest in a law work as the Fathers called it, but that the idea is that you just positively
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.240]   offer Christ to people and the benefits of salvation and that that is all that you have
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   to do and that the only cause of condemnation now is rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.560]   Well, I think we have been able to see the fallacy that is involved in that kind of argument
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.680]   and opposition.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.440]   But that is not the only misunderstanding with regard to the law.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.640]   There are many others.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.280]   So we have been looking at the function of the law and the purpose of the law, and we
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.320]   have seen that the law is given in order that we may know something about the being and
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.880]   the character of God.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.680]   God was revealing himself when he gave the law in this explicit form to the children
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   of Israel.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.000]   Not only that, he was reminding them of the law that he had originally placed in the heart
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.780]   of men.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.440]   He reminds us by the law, in other words, of his demands upon us, and the demands of
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.400]   God are still there.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.840]   The first table of the law and the second table of the law are still God's demand upon
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.860]   the whole of mankind.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.880]   So the law reminds us of that, of what kind of people we ought to be.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:43.560]   And then we have gone on to see that it is the law only that gives us a true understanding
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.640]   of the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.880]   We think we know what sin is, but we rarely do not until the law has done its work in
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.500]   us and upon us.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:03.320]   It is the law of God alone that reveals and manifests the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.360]   And we have considered that in detail.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.000]   And we have also, last Sunday morning, looked at it all from a very general standpoint and
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.720]   have seen how most of what is wrong with the world this morningâ€”indeed, we can go further
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.060]   and say that all of what is wrong with the world this morning can ultimately be traced
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.840]   back to this one single cause, that man is ignorant of the law of God and all that it
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   has to tell us.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.760]   Very well, that is the point at which we have arrived, but still we have not finished with
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   this subject, and for this good reason.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.000]   That there is one further misunderstanding with respect to the law, which we have to
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.720]   consider and that is a very, very vital one.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.140]   Let me put it again in this form.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.320]   Why did God ever give this law to the children of Israel through Moses?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.020]   That is the statement.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.060]   The law was given by Moses.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.940]   What it means is that God gave the law through Moses to the children of Israel.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.220]   And as we were reminded in the reading from Galatians 3 at the beginning, it was mediated
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.380]   through the angels to Moses.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.620]   But why was it ever done?
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.480]   Now we have already had many answers to that question, but I have put the question anew
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.660]   and afresh in order that I may put it in this form.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.000]   The whole trouble, in a sense, with the children of Israel, both in the Old Testament and especially
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.140]   at the time when our Lord came into this world, their whole trouble was due to the fact that
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:52.180]   they misunderstood, misapplied, and abused the law of God.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.420]   That is why, of course, you get so much attention paid to the law in the pages of the New Testament.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.300]   You get our Lord himself dealing with it.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.740]   He says, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.260]   I am come not to destroy but to fulfill."
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.460]   That is why you get discussions concerning it recorded in the book of the Acts of the
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   Apostles.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.020]   And that is why it is the major theme, in a sense, of epistles like that to the Romans
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.420]   and that to the Galatians, and comes in inevitably in many other epistles also.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.700]   It is all due to the fact that they had misunderstood the meaning of the law and the function of
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.580]   the law, and thereby had abused it.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.700]   It was the main cause of their trouble and of their tragedy.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.140]   Well, now, it is to this that I am anxious to call your attention in particular this
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.300]   morning, because it is still of tames.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.420]   And there are many people in trouble about their spiritual experience simply because
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.420]   they are abusing the law or misunderstanding it in some shape or form.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.340]   Constantly one finds in pastoral experience that Christian people who are in trouble are
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.300]   very often in trouble simply because they have gone back again under the law and have
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.580]   been guilty of this abuse, which I say was so true of the children of Israel.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.580]   And there are others who are uncertain as to whether they are Christians or not.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.700]   It is always for this selfsame reason, so that there is nothing that is more important
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.220]   for us than to have a clear conception of the relationship of law and grace, the very
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.340]   thing put before us in this verse.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.700]   Well, therefore, I put it in this form.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:43.700]   The law was never given as a possible way of salvation.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.860]   Now, there I put it in the form of an assertion or a principle.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.340]   The law was never given to be a possible way of salvation.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:03.660]   Now, there, you see, at once we come face to face with this cardinal error of which
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.940]   the Jews were guilty.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.060]   They having misunderstood the function and the purpose of the law, were regarding it
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.020]   as a means and a way of salvation.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.060]   They believed that by the observance of the law and the carrying out of the law, they
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.620]   could justify themselves before God and they could work up a righteousness which would
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.420]   satisfy the demands of God.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.820]   That was their initial and their continuing and their cardinal error.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.460]   Now, there are many, I say today, who are in exactly the same position.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:44.100]   They do not always put it in terms of law, of course, but it is the principle that matters.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.780]   All people who think that they can make themselves Christian are guilty of this same error.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.460]   All people, in other words, who think that a Christian is to be defined as a man who
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.380]   lives a good life or a man who does a lot of good or a man who sacrifices himself for
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.860]   the sake of others, they are all guilty of this particular error.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.380]   Anybody who thinks that he or she can ever satisfy God and be accepted of God and get
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:18.500]   into heaven in the end, on the basis of their own actions and activities, are immediately
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.620]   confessing that they are guilty of this very thing.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:28.580]   Now, that is, I say, to believe that you can justify yourself by the deeds of the law,
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.140]   that you can justify yourself by your works, by your action, by your conduct.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:40.620]   And it is amazing to notice how common this basic error still is.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.100]   There are so many people who do this.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.140]   It is being done so often.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.140]   You notice it in many different forms.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.380]   You will find certain men described as outstanding Christians, for instance.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.980]   But when you come to examine these men and their beliefs, you will find it is this.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.300]   They do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.260]   Some of them even deny his deity.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.700]   But why then are they regarded as outstanding Christians?
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.140]   Well, because of the good work they are doing.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.140]   They have made sacrifices.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.140]   They are serving humanity.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.260]   They are trying to put into practice the ethic of Christ.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.780]   They do not rely upon his death and upon his blood.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.460]   In fact, they dismiss it.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.460]   They denounce it.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.820]   They do not believe it at all.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.620]   Nevertheless, they are regarded as Christians.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.900]   This is just a confession that people who regard men like that as Christians have never
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:38.100]   understood that the law was never given as a possible means of salvation and of reconciliation
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.100]   with God.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:47.460]   All reliance upon living and life and character and action and good works and so on, any reliance
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:54.420]   upon that is immediately to misunderstand the whole point and purpose of the giving
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.860]   of the law.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.260]   Sure there are many today who do that, you see, even as it was done by the children of
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.740]   Israel of old.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:08.860]   But even beyond that, there is a very definite teaching which is sometimes known under the
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:16.700]   name of dispensationalism, which teaches exactly the same thing, which would have us believe
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.260]   that the gospel of the grace of God did not begin until the death and resurrection of
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:28.660]   the Lord Jesus Christ, that during his lifetime he did not speak about grace at all.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:34.540]   He was preaching the gospel of the kingdom, as they call it, a kind of legal doctrine,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.300]   that they were to be saved in that way.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.020]   But it was only when they rejected him as the Messiah that the whole notion of the gospel
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.580]   of the grace of God came in, so that they tell us that if you look for the gospel of
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.660]   the grace of God, you must not go to the Gospels.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.000]   You must go to the epistles, and particularly the epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.740]   and things like that.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.640]   And then they go on and say this, that after our Lord has returned into this world and
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.180]   set up his kingdom, the gospel of the grace of God will not then be preached, but people
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.820]   will then be saved by this gospel of the kingdom again.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.560]   No longer grace, but evidently by some works of theirs and their obedience.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:22.180]   In other words, their dispensational teaching has several types of gospel, and this gospel
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.540]   of grace is only a kind of interim gospel.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:31.700]   Well, now that, of course, is just to misunderstand this whole question of the law radically root
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.280]   and branch.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.140]   It is to indicate that there was a time and will again be a time when men can be saved
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.100]   by their own actions, by their conformity to law, that it is possible for us to be saved
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:51.020]   apart from and without the grace of God in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.940]   They put it bluntly like this, you see, that if the Jews had only believed and accepted
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.180]   the teaching of the Lord concerning his kingdom, well then, the gospel of grace would never
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.820]   have been needed at all and would never have come in.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:11.260]   Now that, to me, is the most basic misunderstanding of this whole matter, which one can even conceive
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.260]   of.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.460]   Very well, sir, you see the importance of looking at all this.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.020]   Well, now, what is the answer to it?
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:26.620]   Well, the answer is that the law was never given as a possible means of salvation.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.060]   We must once and forever get rid of the idea that God, as it were, through the law, was
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.740]   trying an experiment, for that is what it really comes to, according to that view.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.740]   That God said various things to the children of Israel, and then he said to them, "Well,
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.420]   now then, here it is, I'll put it in the form of a law to you.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.940]   And you keep that law and live that law, and you'll be saved."
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.260]   An experiment, but they failed to do so.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:58.220]   That God, in other words, gave it as a possible means or way of salvation.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:04.140]   Now let me give you the evidence on which I make this assertion that God never did that,
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:11.700]   that the law was never given as a possible way or means of salvation and of deliverance.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.700]   Now here is the evidence.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.700]   It is quite abundant.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.660]   Let us take it first of all as it is put to us by the Apostle Paul in his epistle to the
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.980]   Romans.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.700]   He deals with it in chapter 9.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.700]   Of course, he deals with it in the first three chapters.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.660]   That is the point of the first three chapters, where he shows that justification is by faith
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.180]   only.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.540]   He says, "By the law is the knowledge of sin, and by the deeds of the law shall no
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.660]   man be justified in his sight."
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.060]   Very well, but listen, here it is still more explicitly, perhaps, in chapter 9, where he
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.740]   shows this basic tragic error of the Jew, beginning to read at verse 30.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.100]   What shall we say then?
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:00.260]   That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness,
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.060]   in the righteousness which is of faith.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.740]   But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.100]   of righteousness.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.100]   Wherefore?
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.900]   For they stumbled at that stumbling stone.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.420]   They did indeed.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.980]   And that has been the stumbling stone, as I am pointing out to you, ever since.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.940]   There are so many stumbling at it still.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:32.780]   They sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.300]   They stumbled at that stumbling stone, as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.620]   stone and a rock of offense, and whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed."
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.180]   Then he goes on in chapter 10 to work out the same point.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.760]   "Brethren," he says, "my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   be saved.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.060]   For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God."
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.060]   That wasn't their trouble.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.080]   They had a zeal of God.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.960]   They were trying to please God.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.920]   They wanted to be just with God, and they wanted to be blessed by God.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.640]   They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   "For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.920]   have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:29.800]   For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.320]   For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law like this, that the men which
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.640]   doeth those things shall live by them."
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   Well, now, then, there is a perfectly plain statement follows.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   That the whole trouble with the Jews in their rejection of Christ was their misunderstanding
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.980]   of the law.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.480]   They said, "God has given us the law, and by our keeping of that law we are justifying
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.640]   ourselves in the sight of God.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   By keeping this law we are becoming righteous, and therefore we don't believe this teaching."
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   The teaching of Christ was the whole purpose of his coming.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.760]   Everything that he said and did was to condemn them and to say that in him and in him alone
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.000]   was salvation.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.360]   But they saw no need of this.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   Why?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.540]   Well, because they thought their good works, their keeping of the law, was the way whereby
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.120]   they were saving themselves.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.160]   They were going about, as he puts it, to establish their own righteousness, and that is why they
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.520]   wouldn't submit to the righteousness of God.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.860]   That is the misunderstanding of the law.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.280]   But listen to it once more.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.080]   In that great statement of it which we had in that portion of scripture read at the beginning
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:53.220]   in Galatians 3, because there it is put very plainly and clearly, the point that is made
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:02.240]   here quite explicitly by the apostle is that God did not give the law as a means of salvation.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.460]   He had already preached the gospel, as he says, in Abraham.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.780]   Now I do trust that we are all clear about this.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:16.060]   Take that eighth verse, "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:24.660]   through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660]   be blessed."
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.940]   Now there are so many people who say the gospel only starts after the Lord Jesus Christ comes
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.540]   into this world, and some, as I have told you, would even postpone it until his resurrection.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.500]   There was no gospel, they say, until then.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.220]   Nothing about the grace of God until then.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.860]   The answer is, it all begins with Abraham, and it is even before Abraham.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.900]   It was stated explicitly.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.500]   It was preached to Abraham, but it was there before.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.180]   Indeed, it began back in the Garden of Eden, and you will find it in Genesis 3.15.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.180]   Very well.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:04.180]   The scripture, "Foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.300]   before the gospel unto Abraham."
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:14.540]   Grace, the promise of grace as a way of salvation, comes explicitly at the time of Abraham.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.300]   "So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," and so on.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.820]   It is in his seed that this blessing is going to come.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.660]   But the apostle was so troubled by the misunderstanding of this thing, and particularly by these people
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.620]   in the churches of Galatia, that he goes even further.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.300]   And he works it out extensively as an argument.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.940]   Listen to this.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.380]   In verse 15 he says, "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men."
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.500]   What he means there is this.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.620]   He says, "Now, in order to make this plain and clear to you, I am going to use an illustration."
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   That is what that means.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.900]   "I am going to put it in very simple terms.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:58.620]   'Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth or
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.260]   addeth thereto, even when a man makes a covenant,' he says."
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   Well, it is valid in law, and nobody ventures to disannul it or to add to it, even with
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.900]   a human document, a man making a will or making a covenant.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.540]   Nobody dares put it on one side or add to it.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.180]   The man's covenant is a man's covenant, and he has set it, and there it is, and it
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.420]   has got to be observed, and it will be observed.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:31.380]   Now then, he says, listen, "To Abraham and his seed, where the promise is made, he saith
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:38.340]   not, 'And to seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.'"
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.200]   In other words, the promise of salvation in Christ by grace was made to Abraham.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.860]   This difference between seeds and seed, he says, means that their God was telling him
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.960]   that it was through Christ who was to come out of his loins, that this great salvation
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.420]   was to come to all nations.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.060]   "By this I say," he says, working out his illustration, "that the covenant that was
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:10.660]   confirmed before of God or by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.620]   years after, cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect."
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.680]   Now you see the argument.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.100]   Back in the time of Abraham, God had made his covenant, he had made his statement, that
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:28.580]   salvation was to be by grace and by grace alone, and that it was to be through this
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.220]   seed that was to come, which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.500]   Now then, says Paul, that's the covenant.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.740]   I've reminded you, he says, that even with an ordinary human earthly covenant, nobody
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.380]   ventures to disannul it or to add to it very well, how much more so in the case of God.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.500]   If God has made his covenant there to Abraham, the law, which comes four hundred and thirty
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.060]   years after, cannot possibly disannul it or put it on one side or make the promise of
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.060]   none effect.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:04.360]   Then he goes on, "For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise."
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.220]   If God now said, "Look here, I'm going to give you a law, you keep this law and it'll
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.420]   save you," well, it would mean that he was going back on his promise.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.020]   He has already said salvation is by grace and by grace alone.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.660]   If he now says, "Here's a law, keep this and it'll save you," he's disannulling his
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660]   own promise.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.780]   That thing is monstrous.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.700]   If the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise, but God gave it to Abraham
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.700]   by promise.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:32.140]   "Oh, very well," says the Jew, "if you are saying that, what's the point in giving a
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.140]   law at all?
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.620]   Why did God ever give a law?
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.780]   If you are saying that it's not given as a means of salvation, why is it given?
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.220]   What purpose does it serve?
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.860]   Wherefore then, serveth the law?"
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   Here's the answer.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:52.820]   "It was added because of transgressions, because of the sinfulness of the people.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.740]   It was added because of transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise was
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.220]   made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:08.540]   Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.540]   Don't worry about that.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.140]   Is the law then against the promises of God?"
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.340]   Now that's the crucial question.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.180]   Is the law militating against the promises of God?
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.900]   And he says the thing is unthinkable.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.900]   God forbid!
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.980]   Out with the suggestion.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.500]   It's a most monstrous thing to say.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   The same God who had given the promise is the very God who has given the law.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.620]   So it's impossible that the law can be against the promises of God.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.620]   God forbid!
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.300]   "For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.700]   should have been by the law.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.420]   If any conceivable law could have produced righteousness, well then, that would have
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.220]   been the way undoubtedly.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:59.640]   But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.460]   might be given to them that believe."
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.980]   Now then, listen.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:11.020]   But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up under the faith which would
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   afterwards be revealed.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.220]   Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, etc.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.660]   But leave that for the moment.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.940]   Now then, what I'm concerned to establish is this, that the apostle has taken all that
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:32.500]   trouble to tell us that God never gave the law as an experiment.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.900]   He never offered it as a possible means or way of salvation.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.620]   That says the apostle would mean that God was going back on his own covenant, on his
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.420]   own oath, on his own word.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.820]   He had already preached the gospel to Abraham and he has not gone back on it and because
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.320]   he is God he could not go back on it.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.260]   So whatever else you may think about the law, you must never regard it as a means whereby
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.820]   you can put yourself right with God.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.080]   That was the whole trouble with the Jews.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.620]   And it is still the trouble with people who think that by their own actions and deeds
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.800]   they can put themselves right with God in any shape or form.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:22.040]   And of course, to complete the argument, we put it like this.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:29.100]   They not only misunderstood the whole function and purpose of the giving of the law, that
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:35.900]   in turn led to their misunderstanding of the actual demands of the law.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.020]   Hence our Lord's exposition of the law in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.580]   "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old, I say unto you."
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.560]   In other words, the only way whereby the Jews or anybody else can ever persuade themselves
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:57.180]   that they can be righteous and just in the sight of God by observing the law is by paying
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:03.060]   attention only to the letter of the law and ignoring the Spirit.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.700]   You will find our Lord was constantly dealing with it.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.100]   Not only did he deal with it in the Sermon on the Mount, you will find he was dealing
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.860]   with it in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, and a corresponding
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.260]   treatment of it in the seventh chapter of Mark, where he points out to these people,
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.240]   he says, "Look here, you have put your traditions before the law of God.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.740]   You say as long as a man doesn't do this or says that, that he's all right."
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.220]   He says, "That's what you say.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.360]   God doesn't say that."
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:38.660]   They were substituting their own reading of the law for the actual demands and dictates
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.380]   of the law of God itself.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.320]   Very well then, there's my first principle.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:49.800]   The law was never given as a possible means of salvation.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:56.340]   Now then, let me press this home particularly to those of us who are evangelical.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.520]   It is, I say, our desire to safeguard the doctrine of justification by faith only that
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.560]   often makes us as evangelicals say, "The law is no longer there.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   We have nothing to do with it.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.960]   We preach Christ only."
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   You see, that's the mistake.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.460]   You are correcting in a wrong way the error and the fallacy of the Jews.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.840]   That is to misunderstand the whole object and purpose of the giving of the law.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   Very well, let's go on and consider what that is.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.140]   So my second principle is this.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:35.280]   That the law was given very largely over and above what it does to convict us of our sin
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.760]   and to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin, it was given very largely to show the utter
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:47.000]   and complete impossibility of salvation by the law.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.200]   Now I'm not trying to be paradoxical, but I'm putting it like that in order to put
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.520]   emphasis to it.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.720]   Not only was the law not given as a possible means of salvation, it was given in order
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.320]   to show that salvation along that line was impossible.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.160]   Now then, let me give my authority for that.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:20.360]   Romans 8, 3, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:27.560]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   the flesh."
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.600]   Now here's the phrase, "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.680]   Now here's a very important and crucial statement.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.720]   The law couldn't save the men.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.240]   The law couldn't do it.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.880]   And of course God knew that before he ever gave it.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   So that finally disposes of that other idea, doesn't it?
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   God knows everything.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.760]   He knows the end from the beginning.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.640]   Nothing is hidden from him.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.840]   God knew before he ever gave the law that the law couldn't save anybody.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   What the law could not do.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.200]   So why couldn't the law do it?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.480]   Well, he says, "Because it was weak through the flesh."
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.760]   What does he mean by this?
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.960]   Well I think that means three main things.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.920]   Let me just put them before you.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:27.800]   The law couldn't save anybody for this reason, because of the exalted character of its demands.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.440]   You see, the Jews, as I've just told you, they thought they were keeping the law.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.140]   The apostle Paul thought that he was keeping it.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.200]   You remember that bit of autobiography in Philippians 3, "As concerning the law, blameless
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Jesus."
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   That was when he was a Pharisee.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.680]   He really thought he was keeping the law of God.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.400]   All the Jews thought that.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   What was the matter?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.040]   Well, they'd never realized the real demand of the law of God.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.200]   They were reducing everything.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.520]   They'd turned the law of God into something that they could keep.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:05.680]   And that's what every self-righteous, self-justifying, respectable person who doesn't believe in
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.960]   Christ is still doing.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.020]   You see, they set up their own little standard.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.960]   They know they're already keeping that, and therefore everything's all right.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.040]   Yes, but as Paul says, that isn't the righteousness of God.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.660]   That's your righteousness.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.960]   You say, "As long as I don't do this or that, and as long as I do good, I'm surely
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   satisfying God."
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   I know, that's what you say.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.160]   It isn't what God says.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   What does God say?
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.360]   Well, what God says is this, "You've got to love me with all your heart and all your
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   soul and all your mind and all your strength.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.800]   And then, having done that, you've got to love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.840]   Now, that is the demand of God's law, and nothing less than that.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   It's not that he's arguing.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.480]   That's what God has said.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.720]   You see, you may be highly respectable and a very nice and good person, but are you loving
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.280]   God with the whole of your being?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.640]   I can prove to you you're not.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.840]   You're loving yourself because you're pleased with yourself, you're proud of yourself and
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.360]   your actions.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.400]   And you don't see the need of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.360]   You're a terrible sinner.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.720]   You are of all sinners, perhaps the greatest of all.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.360]   There is no greater sin than spiritual pride, self-satisfaction, feeling that the Son of
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.200]   God need never have come, because we've never sinned, we've never done any wrong.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   And why do people say that?
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   Ah, well, you see, they've got their own definition of sin.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.240]   They've never committed murder, they've never committed adultery, they've never got drunk,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.640]   they've never committed sin, therefore.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.040]   Backbiting they don't regard as sin.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.120]   Pride, jealousy, envy, snobbery, they don't regard those as sin.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.760]   You see, they've got their own definition of sin.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   It isn't God's.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   That's how they do it.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.640]   They've never realized the exalted character of the law.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.280]   The law demands that we love God with the whole of our being, and our neighbor as ourselves,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.240]   that we live to his glory.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.600]   It's interested, as we've seen already, in motives and desires, and it puts as much emphasis
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.160]   on that as it does on, "Oh, thou shalt not covet the thing that got Paul eventually."
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   It's in the law, my friend.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.200]   And if you covet, you're a sinner.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.400]   Well then, let me give you another indication of the demands of the law.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.000]   There I put it in general, but Paul has summed it up like this.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.400]   He says in Romans 13, 10, "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor, therefore love is the
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.160]   fulfillment of the law."
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.600]   And if you're not full of love, you haven't fulfilled the law.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.800]   Love is the fulfillment of the law, and nothing less.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.360]   But let's consider some other statements made about this law.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.760]   Listen to Galatians 5, 3.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:45.000]   "I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.480]   The whole of it.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.720]   And if you want a final word, let's turn to James, and he'll give it us.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.040]   And James is the epistle that you ought to make all self-righteous people read always.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.680]   If you're finding it difficult to convince them of justification by faith, make them
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   read James.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.560]   Now that sounds odd, doesn't it?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.720]   But listen, this is what James says in the second chapter, verse 10.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:14.360]   He says, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.800]   of all."
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:23.600]   If you keep 999.999% of the law, it doesn't save you.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.760]   If there is the slightest failure, he says, you failed in the lot.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:36.440]   "Whosoever keepeth the whole law and yet offendeth in one point, he is guilty of all."
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.720]   That's the demand of the law.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.400]   The law demands an absolute perfection of obedience, and nothing less.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.840]   There are no loopholes, there are no qualifications, there are no get-outs, as we say.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   It's all or nothing.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   Very well.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.800]   There is the law, so the law itself, by its own character and by its own demands, shows
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.960]   quite clearly that it was never meant to justify anybody.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.520]   Who can do that?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.360]   Secondly, what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   What does that mean?
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.600]   Well, it means you are flesh and mine.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.080]   The trouble with the law is that it leaves it to us.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.520]   The law comes to us and says, "There it is, that's what you've got to do."
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.840]   And I've got to do it.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   But I'm weak.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.520]   I am sinful.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.880]   Not only that, there is this awful contradiction in me.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.360]   Now there is the great theme of Romans 7, as you remember.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.160]   The apostle says, "We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   sin.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.400]   For that which I do, I allow not.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.420]   For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.120]   If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   And so on.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.880]   He says, "I know that in me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing, for
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.280]   the will is present with me.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.080]   But how to perform that which is good, I find not."
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.720]   You see, we are not simply asked to give our assent to the law.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.280]   We are not just asked to admire it and say, "It's wonderful.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.240]   That's what a man ought to do, and that's how I ought to."
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.400]   I'm not asked to praise the law, I'm asked to perform it.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.280]   The will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.160]   For the good that I would, I do not.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.700]   But the evil which I would not, that I do.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.800]   And isn't that true of every one of us?
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:34.520]   I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:41.240]   For I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I see another law in my members,
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.160]   in my body, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.720]   law of sin which is in my members.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.360]   O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.840]   There it is, you see.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.640]   The law leaves it to us.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.560]   And I say, "Now the law of God, yes, I see it's good, it's wonderful.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   I'm going to keep that.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   I want to keep that."
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.320]   And I begin to try to, and I fail.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.640]   The law in my members dragging me down.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.200]   I want to do that, I can't do it.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.240]   I know that's wrong.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   I know I shouldn't do it.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.680]   That's the very thing I do.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.440]   That's the whole of life, that's experience.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.160]   It leaves it to me.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.680]   And I am such, and am so constituted, that in me dwelleth no good thing, so that there
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.440]   is this perpetual contradiction, and I can never keep the law that I want to keep with
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.480]   my mind, when I look at it objectively.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:38.840]   In other words, the law simply tells me what I've got to do.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.820]   But we've already seen two or three Sundays ago that it even does something worse because
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.900]   we are sinful.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.480]   It actually inflames our passions and makes us sin all the more.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.600]   Not because there's anything wrong with the law, but because there's so much wrong with
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   us.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.880]   "Was then that which is good made death unto me?
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.720]   God forbid, but sin that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good,
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.400]   that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.440]   Very well, then.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.520]   And lastly, the law was never meant to save for this reason, that it never offers us any
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.080]   help at all.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.160]   It says, "There it is," and leaves me to it.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.400]   It gives me no help, it gives me no strength whatsoever.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.240]   To tell a man what to do is not enough.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.180]   Don't we all know that?
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.320]   That's the whole tragedy of life.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.880]   We can't do what we want to do, but we do what we ought not to do.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.320]   The law simply says, "Do this," and I can't do it.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.680]   And it doesn't give me any help whatsoever.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.720]   It leaves me entirely to myself.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.880]   The result is that the law could not do this, because it was weak through the flesh.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.380]   Now this is the thing that the apostles were given to understand.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.920]   So you've got a wonderful statement there in Acts 15 and in verse 10, where it's put
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.920]   like this.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.680]   The apostle Peter is, you remember, at that conference which was held to discuss this
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.720]   very matter in Jerusalem by the early church.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:01.840]   Now therefore he says, "Why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.120]   which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.360]   There were people, you see, were trying to say that these Gentiles who'd become Christians
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.520]   must be put under the law, that they must be circumcised and so on.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.360]   "Look here," says Peter, "why are you tempting God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.880]   which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   Don't do that, he says.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.220]   It's an impossible yoke.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.800]   No one can ever keep it.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:34.840]   So I sum it up by saying that no one was ever meant to be saved by the law.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.560]   Indeed the law was given in order to show that nobody ever could be saved along that
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   line.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.800]   That's the right way.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.720]   So I come to my third and last principle and put it like this.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.340]   I needn't keep you.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.080]   Why was the law then given?
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.120]   What is the real fundamental object which God had in mind in giving the law?
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.640]   Well, it's the next step in my argument of three principles.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   It was not given as a way of salvation.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.140]   It was given in order to show that no salvation was possible that way, thirdly.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.560]   It was given then to lead us to Christ.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.520]   Now you see why I am so concerned about this verse of ours.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.200]   The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.960]   You see why I am so anxious that we should never dismiss the law, condemn it or ridicule
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.460]   it and say it doesn't matter.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.520]   And we must as Christians think nothing of it because we now believe in Christ and grace.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.680]   You see how wrong that is.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:48.240]   The law was given ultimately in order that it might bring us to Christ.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:57.200]   The law was given that we might know our utter and complete hopelessness and our ultimate
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.800]   complete inability, total inability.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.640]   The difficulty with all of us is that we'll never admit we can't do things.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   The reason why a man doesn't believe in Christ and accept his salvation is that he still
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.900]   thinks that he can do it himself.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.560]   And every one of us needs to be knocked down before we can be raised up.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.240]   Yes you remember the statement that was made by ancient Simeon to the mother of our Lord.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:29.880]   This child, he said, is set for the falling and the rising again of many in Israel.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.280]   We have got to become utter paupers.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:37.160]   We have got to realize our utter final helplessness before we'll ever accept grace.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.480]   And the only thing that brings us to that position is the law of God.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.920]   This is the only thing that finally convinces us and convicts us.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:53.720]   The moment we understand the true nature of the law, we see our complete hopelessness.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.400]   Along the lines I've been indicating to you this morning.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.040]   The demands, no one can arrive there.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.480]   A hundred percent obedience, impossible.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.800]   But here am I with this law in my members and my divided self, impossible.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.800]   I might as well give up at once.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.760]   The law, you see, when it does its work properly in me, makes me desperate.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.720]   Makes me see my utter hopelessness.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:26.000]   It makes me cry out saying, "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.400]   Could my zeal now respite now?
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.040]   Could my tears forever flow?
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.120]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:42.800]   Thou must say, and thou alone."
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.160]   But let me put it in the magnificent language of the apostle in Galatians 3.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Listen to him in Galatians 3, 23 and 24.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:42:00.120]   But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith, shut up unto
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.320]   the faith which would afterwards be revealed.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.880]   That's why the law was given.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.840]   That's the end of his argument, you remember.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.160]   He said the law wasn't given to put aside the doctrine of grace that God had preached
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.800]   to Abraham through the gospel.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   Of course not.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   It would have been a contradiction in God.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.620]   Well, then why was it given?
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.360]   It wasn't meant to disannul the promise.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360]   What for then?
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.240]   Oh, it was meant to shut us up to the promise.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.640]   It was meant to come to men and women and to show them that they could never do anything
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.080]   at all to save themselves.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   They're hemmed in.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.120]   They're shut in to this promise of God which was made originally to Abraham, which now
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.880]   has been fulfilled in the coming of the Son of His love and His perfect work on our behalf.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   Shut up.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.720]   Oh, I rather like this translation.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   You know, it's rather good.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.920]   I'd never thought of it until this minute.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.040]   Do you know what the law says to you?
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   Shut up.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.640]   Shut up about your self-righteousness and all your goodness and your great sacrifice.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.360]   Shut up.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.440]   Not only don't try to go on doing things like that to put yourself right with God, stop
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.000]   talking.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.240]   Put your hand over your mouth.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.480]   Get down into dust and ashes.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:16.680]   You most respectable men in the world, the most moral, ethical individual, get down and
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.920]   put on your sackcloth and ashes.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.560]   Shut up.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.600]   But then he adds this further statement.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.840]   Wherefore?
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:34.280]   The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.160]   And the law is still the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.080]   And I assert again that no man ever truly comes to Christ except he be brought by this
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.280]   schoolmaster.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.480]   I don't understand a conversion and a regeneration that says, "I know nothing about repentance."
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.200]   I don't find such a gospel in the Scriptures.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.520]   The law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.440]   If you say, "Oh, I came to Christ because I wanted to be blessed by him.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.120]   I wanted this, that, and the other."
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.000]   If you didn't come to him, if you've never come to him as a desperate sinner, you've
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.480]   not come to him.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:20.320]   The law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.020]   That's why it was given.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.240]   That is the inspired account of the cause of the giving of the law.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   Therefore we must never dismiss the law.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.800]   Don't misinterpret John 1.17.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.320]   Don't kick the law out.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   It's not meant to be.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.760]   That's not his object of purpose at all.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.600]   He is showing that it was meant to be the schoolmaster that brings us to Christ and
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.800]   the glories of what Christ has given us.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.360]   Don't depreciate the law.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.520]   He wants to emphasize the preeminence of Christ and what he has brought to us.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.800]   Very well then, I say that the right reaction to the error of the Jews and to all who are
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:01.360]   trying to justify themselves by their works and by their actions is not to depreciate
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.440]   or to condemn or to dismiss the law.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   What is it then?
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.280]   It is to use the law rightly.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.800]   It is to use the law properly.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.480]   If I preach the law in such a way as to send somebody home thinking, "Very well, all
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.000]   I've got to do is to live like that and I'm going to be a Christian," I have preached
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.600]   the law badly and I have preached it wrongly.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.080]   But if I have preached the law in such a way as to make a man see I am completely and entirely
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.400]   hopeless unless I can be saved by someone outside myself, I am done for.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.880]   I have preached it properly.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.320]   That's the answer to the Jews.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.560]   Not to preach law at all, but to preach law properly.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.180]   The opposite of preaching the law wrongly is not not to preach it at all.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.720]   It is to preach it rightly.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.640]   It is to preach it properly.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:54.920]   Let me again quote the apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 1, 8-11, and with this I leave you.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.480]   He says, "But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully."
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.920]   These people, as he was trying to bring the law back, Paul says, "No, you're doing
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.200]   it in the wrong way.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.880]   The law is good if a man use it lawfully.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.800]   Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.560]   for the ungodly and for sinners and for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.080]   murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.760]   with mankind, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.880]   other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.320]   God which was committed to my trust, that's the right use of the law.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.200]   And that is the way in which we should look at this."
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:44.000]   Oh, I am concerned about this not primarily as a matter of theology.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.760]   I was concerned about this primarily as a pastor.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.440]   Almost every Sunday somebody or another comes to me who is in trouble about this.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.280]   They say, "But you know, my past life, my sin."
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   And the moment they say that to me, I know they've never understood this question of
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.480]   the law properly.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.560]   I say, "You are confessing to me that you are a sinner."
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   "Oh, yes, I'm terrible."
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.760]   "Well," I say, "but that's your very right to justification by faith."
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.640]   "But if you only knew."
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.680]   I say, "It doesn't matter what I know or what I don't know.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.160]   Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.320]   God justifies the ungodly."
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.240]   And while people are hesitating and wondering whether they can be forgiven because of their
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.880]   sin, what it really means is, you see, that they still have got a hankering notion somewhere
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.080]   that if only they lived a better life, that all would be right.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.720]   If only they could get rid of their sin, or if they could stop committing it, all would
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   be right.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.880]   But it means that they're still under the law.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.720]   It means that they're guilty of this initial error of regarding the law as a means and
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.660]   a way of salvation and of deliverance, and it's not that.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.960]   My dear friend, are you clear about this?
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:03.640]   By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by the law is
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.520]   simply the knowledge of sin.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.720]   It'll convict you.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   It'll knock you down.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.800]   It'll shut you up.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.560]   It'll leave you in complete and entire helplessness.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:22.700]   And by so doing, it is acting as the schoolmaster, the pedagogue, to lead you to the only one
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.760]   who can save you, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.000]   The law was given through Moses.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.480]   Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.200]   Amen.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   The closing hymn is hymn number 381.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   381.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:49.640]   Out of the depths I cry to thee, Lord, hear me.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.760]   I implore thee, bend down thy gracious ear to me.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.040]   Regard my prayer before thee.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   Martin Luther was brought to see this, and this is how he expresses it.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:06.040]   Hymn number 381.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   Out of the depths I cry to thee, Lord, hear me.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   I implore thee, bend down thy gracious ear to me.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:50:05.040]   Regard my prayer before thee.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:25.040]   Martin Luther was brought to see this, and this is how he expresses it.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   I implore thee, bend down thy gracious ear to me.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   And I'll fly o'er with thee, my Lord, and love thee by all day.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   I'll hail the Lord with faithful word, to thee, O God, I'll sing.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   I'll be his love before the world, he'll be my love, Lord, and my God.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   He'll have my way with grace, now.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   Luther was risen from the cross, and raised from the dead.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   He's the King of glory, and the King of glory.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   And I am able, tell of thee, to gather the family in thee,
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   of all their children's heart.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   abide and continue with us now, throughout the remainder of this hour's short
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we stand before God
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   in the final judgment, and enter into the glories of eternity.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.040]   Amen.
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
