[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.560]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 7, reading from verse 54 to the end of the
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:23.160]   chapter, to verse 60. Here we come to the conclusion, the grand climax of this extraordinary
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.920]   chapter which has been engaging our attention Sunday by Sunday, apart from two Sundays when
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.480]   I was away, since the second Sunday of last October. It is, as we've been seeing, those
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.180]   who attend here regularly, not only a great chapter but a very vital chapter in the understanding
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.440]   of the Christian faith and of the Christian Church. The great question today is, what
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.120]   is Christianity? It's not surprising the people outside the Church find it difficult to know
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   what it is when there are so many different vices within. The confusion arises from within.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920]   My suggestion is that the most urgently important thing at the present time for all of us as
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.360]   individuals and for the Christian Church as a whole is to know what this thing really
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.920]   is and what it means. And in this chapter I think we are shown that very clearly. Here
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.760]   I say is the climax to this story. It's the story of this first Christian martyr whose
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.440]   name was Stephen. There you read the account of his murder. It wasn't a judicial trial,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.980]   this is murder. And there you have an account of it. But it's the climax, it's the end
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.600]   of the story that is unfolded at the end of the sixth chapter and during the body of this
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   seventh chapter. This man's arrested because he's a Christian and because he's an official
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.240]   in the Christian Church, because of his preaching, because of his miracles. And they put him
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.120]   on trial. They charge him with blasphemy. They say that he's guilty of blasphemy because
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.240]   as they understand things he's against Moses, he's against the law, he's against the
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.160]   temple. He's therefore guilty of blasphemy. And they put him on trial because of it. And
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.000]   having asked him what he's got to say for himself, Stephen addresses them. And in this
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.440]   chapter as we've seen, he takes and makes a kind of review of the history of the children
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480]   of Israel, the thing they were so proud of. And he picks out in particular three persons.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   Abraham, their father Abraham, they were so proud of him. He shows them that they really
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.800]   never understood the story of Abraham. And then he takes up the case of Joseph and there
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.440]   very simply he's able to show them that their treatment of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.680]   nothing but a repetition of the way in which Joseph was treated by his brothers. And then
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.320]   he comes to the crucial case of Moses. Moses, the great lawgiver, they rejoiced in him.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   And he tells them the story of Moses and shows them what Moses had said and what Moses had
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.280]   done. And thereby he works out, as I'm going to show you, the real meaning of these
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.320]   things. And then having done that, he applies his message to them. We were considering it
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   last Sunday night. "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.840]   resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so do ye." And so on. And then this is what
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.640]   happened. When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.720]   him with their teeth. They threw him outside the city and then they stoned him to death.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.520]   Now I say what is of importance to us here is this. It is important that we should know
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.920]   all about this historically. But what seems to me to be of a special value here always
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:09.040]   is that it gives us a very wonderful picture of what a Christian really is. If you want
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.200]   to know what to be a Christian is, what Christianity means, and what it does for a human being,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.960]   well, let's look at this together. Here it is, I say, put before us in a most astonishing
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.600]   manner. We finish now with exposition. We're just looking at something happening. It's
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:36.200]   a very dramatic incident. And here I say as we look at this, this kind of ending to this
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.080]   great speech of Stephen the First, Christian martyr, we have this wonderful picture of
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.160]   what it means to be a Christian. And I want to show it to you in terms of a contrast.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.120]   That's always a good way of looking at something, isn't it? It helps you to contrast it with
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.360]   something. And here it's all done for us. We see this tremendous contrast between the
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.560]   members of the Sanhedrin and Stephen. This is how it's put in the record. When they
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:26.120]   But he, but he, and immediately there is a remarkable and an amazing contrast. The very
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.520]   word "but" puts that before us in a very dramatic manner immediately. You turn to an
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.280]   entirely different atmosphere. Indeed, I never read this great chapter without always being
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.760]   struck by this. Stephen goes through this history and makes his analysis of it. Oh,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   and it's one that is full of unhappiness and of disappointment. What a sad record is
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   that record of the children of Israel. What a miserable people these members of the Sanhedrin
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.360]   are. Then suddenly, it's like passing out of a cloud and a storm into the most glorious
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.440]   sunshine. There's a beam of light and everything is transfigured and transformed. You look
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:14.280]   at Stephen and there you see a Christian in contradistinction to the non-Christian and
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.480]   you're amazed at the difference. Well, that's the first point I want to establish this evening.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.760]   The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is about the profoundest thing in the universe
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.240]   tonight. There is no bigger contrast than that. You know, it's because so many have
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.840]   not realized this, that the Christian Church as she is, as she is today, it's very difficult
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.720]   to tell who is a Christian today. The Church and the world are so similar and that is because
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.880]   the world has come into the Church. There's been a lowering of all the standards in belief,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.120]   in department, in behavior, in appearance, in everything else. This silly foolish notion
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   that you can win people by being like them. It's a complete fallacy. It's a denial
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.360]   of the whole of the gospel. There was never a being in this world more different from
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:20.280]   the world than the Lord Jesus Christ. But he attracted publicans and sinners unto himself.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.160]   Why? Because he was like them? No, because he was eternally different from them. But
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.200]   you see, it's so difficult today. What is a Christian? Nobody seems to know. The standards
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.240]   have been lowered. And as I say, everything has been muddled up together. The lines are
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.720]   no longer distinct. But if you look at this New Testament, this book of the Acts of the
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.160]   Apostles, what strikes you immediately is the amazing contrast between the Christian
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.520]   and the non-Christian. It's an absolute difference. Did you hear it in 2 Corinthians
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   5, 17? If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creation. He's not a man
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.840]   who's been improved a bit, not a man who's been polished up a bit, given a new suit.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   No, no, he's born again. He's made anew. Something entirely different has come into
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.960]   being as the result of the action of God. The difference between the Christian and the
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.120]   non-Christian is held before us here in the contrast between Stephen and the members of
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.960]   the Sanhedrin. Here it is, shouting at you. You say this is an extreme case. It isn't
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.520]   an extreme case. It's a very dramatic one. The whole thing is heightened here. But the
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:49.680]   principles, the elements of the truth concerning this matter are true in every single case.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.480]   The Christian is not just a good man or a better man than somebody else. He is a new
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:03.600]   man. He is a new being. He is a new creation. Very well, here it is, it strikes us at once,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:12.760]   they, he, and the contrast. Well, let's look at it. First of all, let me ask a question.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:19.360]   What is it that makes this tremendous difference? What is it that produces or accounts for the
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.200]   difference between the Christian and the non-Christian? And in here, in this record, we are told exactly
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:34.320]   what it is. And it is simply our relationship to the Holy Spirit. That is what accounts
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.400]   for this difference. Now, the difference, in other words, between the Christian and
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.880]   the non-Christian is not something natural. Nobody is born a Christian. And a man doesn't
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.120]   become a Christian because he happens to have a certain temperament or because he happens
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.400]   to be a certain type of person. A man doesn't become a Christian because he's a good man
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.960]   by nature or there are certain things about him. No, no, that's an entire fallacy. It
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.600]   has nothing to do with us at all. It's in no way dependent upon what we are. Let's
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.680]   thank God for that. If this is only a gospel for good people, well, then I'd stop preaching
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.520]   it. It's a gospel for anybody. It's a gospel for everybody. That's what the wonderful
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.120]   thing about this. If I were here lecturing on music or something else, as I was saying
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.720]   last Sunday night, well, then I'd have to assume a certain amount of knowledge in you.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.200]   This is the glory of the preacher's position. I know nothing about you. I don't need to
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.520]   know anything about you. I don't care what you are nor who you are. All I know is this,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.640]   that you are one born in sin, shaped in iniquity, and that there'll no good ever come of you
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.720]   until the Spirit of God has dealt with you and he can deal with any one of you as well
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.800]   as with any other one of you. That's the Christian position. It doesn't depend upon
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:04.960]   us at all. It is entirely, I say, this question of the Holy Spirit. Listen. Here's the contrast.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.000]   Stephen looking at the members of the Sanhedrin says, "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.360]   in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost." That's why they were what
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:26.040]   they were. They resist the Holy Ghost. But Stephen, but he being full of the Holy Ghost.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.720]   You see the difference? There was no Holy Spirit in them. They've resisted the Spirit.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.680]   They fought against the Spirit. They are devoid of the Spirit. They are natural men, men as
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   he is by nature. No, nothing of the Holy Spirit of God in them. He, the Christian, he's
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.760]   filled with the Spirit. The Spirit of God is in him. He's a man who is dominated by
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.440]   the Holy Spirit. And all that he is, is produced by the Holy Spirit. And he is being led and
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.400]   guided and influenced by the Holy Spirit. Could it be clearer? They resist the Holy
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:14.360]   Ghost. He's filled with the Holy Ghost. Now this is absolutely basic and fundamental.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   You see, it isn't in us. This is an entirely different factor. This is a factor that comes
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.760]   from the outside. This is the activity of God. Now people resent this, and that's
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   the thing that always amazes us, amazes me. We ought to rejoice at this. If I didn't
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.160]   believe that the whole situation depended upon the activity and the intervention of
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.760]   God, I'd have no message to give you at all. My whole message is this, that God hath
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:51.200]   visited and redeemed his people. It is the action of God. God the Father, God the Son,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:58.760]   God the Holy Spirit. And here we're looking in particular tonight at the activity of the
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.880]   Spirit. Well now, what is it he does? Here's my second point. Having seen that what makes
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.560]   the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is our relationship to the Holy
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:18.520]   Spirit, in the second place I say, what is the nature or the character of this difference
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.920]   which is produced by the Holy Spirit? And here I'm going to confine myself to what
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.880]   we have before us in this immediate context. The first thing we notice very evidently throughout
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   this great chapter and here in the climax is that the Holy Spirit makes all the difference
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.440]   in the world to a man's understanding. Understanding of what? Well, understanding first of all
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:53.080]   in the sense that the Holy Spirit makes an entire difference to the way in which we think,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   to the realm in which we think, to the climate of our thinking. Now this is the most glorious
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:05.600]   thing. The Christian not only differs from and disagrees with the non-Christian with
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.920]   regard to certain details. What is much more important I think is this, is that his whole
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:17.560]   thinking is different. The apostle putting it to the Corinthians says, "We have the
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.680]   mind of Christ." That's it. We look out on everything in a different way. All things
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.240]   are passed away, behold all things have become new. If you are still thinking as the world
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.360]   thinks you're not a Christian. The Christian looks at the same facts as everybody else
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.960]   but he doesn't see them in the same way, he doesn't think about them in the same way.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   The whole climate of his thinking is different. But then it works itself out also in details.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.320]   And this is something that comes out in an extraordinary manner in this great chapter.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.880]   These members of the Sanhedrin as we've been seeing were so wrong and especially where
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.520]   they thought they were so right. That's the tragedy of men in sin. He's so proud
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.840]   of himself and yet he's a fool. Here were the members of the Sanhedrin rejoicing in
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.200]   these things, boasting of them, but as Stephen has shown them, they entirely misunderstand
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.680]   them. Where they thought they were so right and so expert. They were ignorant, they were
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.280]   fools, they're completely misunderstood. What do I mean? Well you see, the one way
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.440]   in which there is this difference in the understanding of the Christian and the non-Christian is
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.120]   with regard to the scriptures. These people have their scriptures, some of them wear authorities
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.040]   on it, and they prided themselves on their knowledge, but they haven't understood the
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.320]   scriptures. Paul again says to the Corinthians, "This is the tragedy," he says, "of
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.520]   my fellow countrymen, the Jews, that Moses is read amongst them in their synagogues every
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.240]   Sunday, but they don't understand him. The veil is there." Though he's read and expanded,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:10.160]   by then they don't understand him, the veil. And Stephen brings out exactly the same point.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:17.440]   The natural man can read a Bible, but he doesn't understand it. He reads the words, he reads
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:25.360]   the letters, he may read the sentences, doesn't get the meaning. This is spiritually understood,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.520]   and they can't do it. Now, this isn't criticism, this is simply description. Those of us who
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.560]   have known the two positions know exactly what it means to the natural man that the
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:42.360]   Bible can be the most boring book in the world. To the Christian, it's the book of life,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.640]   it's the manual of the soul, it's the textbook of salvation, it's the most precious thing
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.880]   in the whole universe. But you see, it applies not only to the scriptures in general. These
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.600]   members of the Sanhedrin, as I say, were so wrong in their understanding of the history
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.160]   that was recorded in their scriptures, the very thing they boasted of. They'd completely
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.200]   misunderstood it. They wouldn't have boasted as they did about Abram, Joseph, and Moses
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.440]   if they'd really understood what their forefathers had done with regard to these men and what
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.520]   they themselves were doing without knowing it. So they don't understand history, and
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:28.120]   they don't understand the teaching. And I would take this and put it into a larger context.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.080]   I've said it many times before from this pulpit, but let me say it again. No man understands
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.480]   the history of the world except the men who sees it with the eyes enlightened by this
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:46.120]   scripture. The professional historians are increasingly admitting that they don't understand
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.800]   it. Your scientific humanists, your classical humanists and others, they're admitting
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.560]   they don't understand the history of the world. My dear friends, I'm not boasting
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.520]   when I say I do understand the history of the world, not because I've got some exceptional
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:07.080]   ability, but because I've got the solution here. Here is the explanation of the whole
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:13.800]   story of men, his unspeakable folly in war and fighting, his drunkenness, his immorality,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.440]   his vice, his lust, his passion, the hell he's made of the world. Here and here alone
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:24.480]   do you understand it. And if you're interested in the history of the future, the more you
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.960]   study this book, the more you'll know about it. If you read this book, you won't pin
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.440]   your faith to any United Nations organization any more than you would have in the past in
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:41.360]   the League of Nations. No, no, you'll realize that it's a doomed, a damned, an evil world,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   that it's under the judgment of God and nothing but the return of the Lord is going
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.800]   to produce order out of it. You'll know that. So you won't waste your time with the foolish
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.840]   idealisms of men who think they're preaching the Christian gospel, but who are simply mouthing
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   their own philosophies and their own ideas. Now this comes out here so plainly. But in
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:15.240]   addition to that, these members of the Sanhedrin had completely misunderstood God's purpose
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   for the Jews. Of course, they were very proud of themselves as Jews and their history as
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.880]   a nation, but they'd never seen it, they never understood it. They always materialized
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.520]   everything. They missed the spiritual element. They couldn't see that God was only using
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.480]   this as a temporary planned method expedient to produce a great blessing for the whole
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.360]   world. He had said it to Abraham, he has the first person he takes up and deals with this
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.760]   case, "In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the world be blessed." But
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:54.200]   the Jews resented this. They couldn't understand it. In other words, they'd completely misunderstood
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.920]   the whole purpose of God in the Jews, in the formation of a nation out of this one man,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.040]   Abraham. Complete misunderstanding. But the Christian understands this. He sees it. And
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.960]   then you see it goes on to other things. These men are charging Stephen with blasphemy. They
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.560]   say, "These men have spoken against the law. We have heard him speak blasphemous words
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:24.640]   against Moses and against God. These men cease not to speak blasphemous words against this
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.000]   holy place, the temple, and the law." They thought they understood the law, but they
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   didn't. And one of the great differences between the Christian and the non-Christian
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.440]   is that the Christian understands the meaning and the purpose of the law. The non-Christian
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:47.400]   never does. The non-Christian always believes that God gave the law in order that men might
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.720]   save themselves by it. That's what he always thinks. He thinks you make yourself a Christian
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.320]   by living a good life, by keeping to a certain code of morality and behavior, and so you
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.040]   make yourself and you justify yourself before God. That's what they thought. That's what
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:09.920]   men still think. But the Christian, oh, as Stephen has been showing so plainly and so
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:18.360]   clearly, he sees that the purpose of the giving of the law was to bring us all under condemnation.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:26.320]   The law was added because of transgressions, that sin might be multiplied. The law came
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:33.240]   in on the side as it were what for? To show the exceeding sinfulness of sin. That's its
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.880]   object. It was never meant to save. It couldn't save. What the law could not do in that it
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.200]   was weak through the flesh. It was impossible. Now the Christian understands this. The Christian
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:53.480]   realizes that the main function and purpose of the law is to show us our absolutely lost,
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:01.440]   helpless, hopeless condition, and to lead us to Christ. The law was our schoolmaster
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:08.680]   to bring us to Christ. The law in its commandments and especially in its ceremonial, in its burnt
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.040]   offerings and sacrifices, what's it saying? Is it saying that if you live a good life
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.360]   and you take your offerings and your sacrifices with regularity to God, you'll save yourself?
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.720]   No, no. What it's saying is this, that nothing you can ever do will ever save you. All this
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   is but a picture of how God's going to save you. God is going to provide a lamb. God is
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.040]   going to provide a sacrifice and an offering. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.440]   to everyone that believeth. He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.280]   The Christian understands this. These people are blind to it. They've rejected Christ
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.080]   and they're persecuting and putting on trial this man Stephen who has been preaching this
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.520]   kind of thing. So you see, the understanding is entirely different and it's all the work
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:05.960]   of the Holy Spirit, working in the understanding. And another thing. It is only the Christian
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:13.000]   who understands the true meaning of worship and the purpose and the place and the function
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.640]   of the temple. These members of the Sanhedrin, they were worshipping the temple in the cells.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.840]   They believed that you could only worship in the temple. That's why Stephen in his defense
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.640]   has gone back to Abraham. He said, "How do you think your father Abraham worshipped?
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:35.360]   He hadn't got a temple. He was a pagan living in our other celtes. A pagan. God called him
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.160]   out from paganism. Not through a temple, not through a tabernacle. There wasn't one. This
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.840]   man met with God and he knew him. He was the friend of God and he worshipped him. God dwelleth
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:54.120]   not in temples made with hens. He has demolished this whole institutional idea of the Christian
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.680]   church and he's shown that worship is not something that depends upon buildings or places
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:08.000]   or ceremonial or ritual or a priesthood, but on one thing and one thing only. And that
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.880]   is our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ. Not on temples, not on circumcision, not on
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:24.680]   anything but this. We are the circumcision who worship God in the Spirit and rejoice
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:32.040]   in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. Stephen, if he knew all this, they
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:42.080]   didn't. We read here about Stephen that he called upon the Lord and they stole Stephen
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:50.600]   as he was calling upon and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Now the Authorized
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.480]   Translation has added the word God. It says Stephen calling upon God and saying, "Lord
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:05.080]   Jesus." It shouldn't be there. Stephen calling upon and saying unto, "Lord Jesus, receive
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:12.480]   my spirit." He's worshipping him. He's offering him worship and adoration because he has made
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:19.800]   this grim discovery that there is only one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.640]   Jesus. Because he has believed the words of the Lord who said, "I am the way, the truth
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:32.920]   and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." And he knows this. He doesn't
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.000]   rely upon the temple. You can worship God without it. You mustn't worship it and say
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.760]   it's essential. It's soon going to be demolished. And it was in A.D. 70. But still you can worship
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.360]   God without it because you have this one and only mediator. Well now there you see in this
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:57.520]   immediate context, we see the essential difference that the Holy Spirit makes to the understanding,
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.200]   the entirely different understanding of the Christian from that of the non-Christian.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:09.400]   Notice in the second place, the entire difference that he produces in the spirit of these people,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.760]   the different spirit that is in the Christian from that of the non-Christian. Could anything
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:20.680]   be plainer than what we read here? Listen. "When they heard these things, they were
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:27.720]   cut to the heart and they gnashed him with their teeth. They cried out with a loud voice
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.240]   and stuck their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:41.200]   stoned him." That's their spirit. I didn't dwell upon this, I did last Sunday night.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:49.000]   We saw it in all its horror and all its vileness. That's the spirit of the natural man. That's
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.840]   the spirit of man without, that is the character of man without the spirit of God in him. That's
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.120]   his heart, that's his spirit, that's his nature. What a terrible, what a horrible,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   what a foul thing it is. Utterly unjustified in their actions. Utterly wrong, violent,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:20.800]   insensitive, mad. But look at this other man, but he being full of the Holy Ghost. Oh, what
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:27.680]   a contrast he presents. What is it? He's a humble man. He's a man who's got a heart
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:38.640]   of compassion. He's like his blessed Lord. He's got sympathy. He's got understanding.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:45.760]   You see, our Lord himself had said in his teaching that the people he was going to produce
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.720]   would be people like himself. He'd said to them, "You've got to be perfect as your
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:59.880]   Father which is in heaven is perfect." And here is a man exemplifying this. Our Lord
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.560]   had said unto them, "Blessed are ye when men persecute you and shall revile you and
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.920]   shall say all manner of evil against you." What else had he said to them? Well, you remember
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.120]   he'd said this to them. You'll find it at the end of the fifth chapter of Matthew's
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.840]   Gospel. "You have heard that it has been said, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:28.120]   thine enemy.' But I say unto you, love your enemies. Love your enemies. Do good to them.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   Bless them that curse you. Do good to them that hate you. And pray for them which despitefully
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.880]   use you and persecute you, that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.760]   For he maketh his Son to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.400]   and on the unjust. If you love them which love you, what reward of you? Do not even
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.840]   the publicans the same. And if you salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:02.820]   Do not even the publicans serve? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.960]   is perfect." And listen, here's a man being stoned to death for nothing because
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.560]   he's a Christian. He's done no harm to them nor to anybody else. He's doing great
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.800]   good. He's worked miracles. He's preaching a gospel of love and of salvation. And they
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:22.360]   stone him and mash their teeth. They hate him. Listen, "He kneeled down and cried
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:32.400]   with a loud voice, 'Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.' He's sorry for them
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.880]   though they're killing him. He's got a heart full of mercy and of compassion toward
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.400]   them. He grieves for them. He intercedes for them. He prays that they may not be punished
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:49.880]   for this, that this shall be added to the account that is already against them. He asks
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:57.320]   God to have mercy upon them because he knows that they don't know what they're doing.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:03.560]   He does exactly, you remember, what his Lord and Master had done upon the cross. 'Father,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:11.400]   forgive them for they know not what they do.'" My friends, this is Christianity.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.600]   It not only gives a man a different understanding and attitude, it changes his whole spirit
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.120]   of nature. He doesn't live like a natural man, "You hit me, I'll hit you. I must
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.480]   have my rights." No, no. He's got an entirely different view. There's a new spirit within
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:32.280]   him, a spirit that can enable him even to love his enemies.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:41.640]   But you know the big, the third great difference and one of the most momentous of all between
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:49.520]   the Christian and the non-Christian is the way in which they face death. And when he
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:58.480]   had said this, he fell asleep, even being stoned to death. Now this is a very beautiful
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:07.520]   expression, isn't it? He fell asleep. That's how the Christian dies. We've got an account
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.800]   in the fifth chapter, you remember, about the death of two people called Ananias and
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Sapphira. What a different account we are given of their dying. They cheated, you remember,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.680]   they'd lied to the Holy Ghost. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:29.760]   the ghost. And exactly the same thing happened to Ananias and Sapphira, his wife. Then fell
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:39.080]   she down straightway at his feet and healed her up the ghost. But this man, he falls asleep.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   Now let's be clear about this. You know the ultimate test to apply to every one of
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.400]   us and to any theory of life that we may happen to hold tonight, the ultimate test of it is
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:57.840]   this. How does it help you to face death? It's no use beating about the bush. It's
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.920]   all very well to talk cleverly when you're young and got health and everything's going
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.200]   well with you. Here's the great question. What are you like when you're face to face
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:14.840]   with death? You're all know somebody else's. And this is the special glory of this Christian
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.560]   message, this Christian faith. People think this is some theory. There is nothing in the
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:27.440]   world that is more practical than this gospel and this Christian life. Here is something
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.560]   that enables a man to live, it enables a man to die. Here is the thing that always shines
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:39.720]   out most gloriously and brilliantly in the great crises of life. I'm not interested
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.640]   in a theory that's all right when everything is all right. The way you test any view of
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.800]   life is what's it like in the difficulties, in the crises, in the agony, in the heartache,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:33:01.000]   in the heartbreak. And especially when you face the last enemy, which is death. And here's
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.600]   your answer. Now you see this is the value of history, isn't it? Oh, you may say it's
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.040]   all very well for these men to write eloquently about the Christian facing death. I wonder
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.720]   what they're like when they have to face it. Here's your answer. Here's a man facing it.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.800]   This is literal history. And he's only the first of many, remember. He is the first Christian
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.400]   martyr. But you see what you see in this man, Stephen, is what you see in all true Christians,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.720]   whether they're martyred or whether they die on their beds, doesn't matter. This is how
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.880]   they face it. Here is a perfect picture, as if God sets a great sample, a great example
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:44.200]   at the very beginning. Oh, what a crowd of followed this man. The glorious army of martyrs.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.160]   They come down the running centuries and in different ways and forms, they but repeat
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.280]   what this man Stephen did. What do we find here? Well, the whole essence of the thing
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:34:02.800]   is this. There is no fear. There's no terror. There's no alarm. He isn't excited, frantic,
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.520]   not knowing what to do, turning on to life. Not at all. Oh, how calm the man is. What
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.800]   a calmness he displays in contrast with the gnashing of the teeth and the fury of these
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:19.040]   wretched members of the Sanhedrin. But what is it that enables the Christian to die like
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:25.360]   this? Well, we are told here very simply. The Christian, you see, can face death as
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:34.080]   Stephen faced it because he can differentiate between the spirit and the body. They stoned
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:44.160]   Stephen as he was calling and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." Now here is one
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.280]   of the most fundamental points that you can ever grasp in this life and in this world.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.840]   The whole tragedy about the non-Christian, the natural man is this, that he regards himself
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:01.080]   virtually as nothing but a body. And so, of course, when the body comes to the end, everything's
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.880]   lost. He's got nothing else. If I die, well, I've lost everything. If I'm killed, it's
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.680]   the end. So I'm nervous, I'm frightened, I'm apprehensive. Oh, there's nothing so
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   terrible as death. Death is a horrible thing. The specter of death approaching me. The world's
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:24.120]   terrified by it. It's doing its utmost to forget this. And that is, of course, because
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   he thinks the body is everything. And when the body is killed or when the body dies,
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.120]   it's the end. But the Christian knows that that's the fallacy. That is the error. The
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.720]   Christian knows that when his body dies, there is that within him which goes on, the spirit.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:47.040]   He doesn't say, "Lord Jesus, receive my body." He says, "Receive my spirit." This is the
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:53.560]   biggest discovery a man can ever make. That the most precious, the most valuable, the
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:59.400]   most glorious thing about you is that you've got a soul or a spirit within you which is
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   imperishable and which goes on and on and on without end. You see, this man had believed
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:13.720]   and was obviously exemplifying in his life what his Lord had taught in the days of his
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:20.640]   flesh. This is how our Lord put it. He was sending out his disciples to preach, and these
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:27.360]   are the words that he addressed to them. "I say unto you, my friends, be not afraid of
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:34.120]   them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:40.080]   you whom ye shall fear. Fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:47.120]   Yea, I say unto you, fear him." Don't be afraid of people who can only kill the body, he says.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.040]   They can't do any more than that. They may kill you, but they can't do any more than
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.440]   that. They can't touch your spirit, they can't touch your soul, they can't touch
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.080]   that which is eternal. Don't be afraid of them. There's a limit to what they can do.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.400]   There's only one to fear, the one who can determine the eternal existence of your soul
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:12.440]   and spirit. Now the Christian starts with that, and it affects the whole of his thinking.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.920]   He knows that the most important thing about him is not that he may have a wonderful body
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:24.000]   or a wonderful brain, but that he's got a soul. And although the body be destroyed by
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.480]   men, and it doesn't matter how, whether it be bombs or anything else, it makes no difference
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   to the soul. This is his basic assumption. And then of course that leads him to take
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:40.680]   an entirely different view of life in this world. To the non-Christian this world isn't
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.040]   the only world, it's everything. And to go out of this world it's the end of all things.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.520]   And of course he's terrified therefore. But the Christian has got an entirely different
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   view of this world. He knows it's a simple world, a form world, a temporary world. You
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.920]   see there's this great contrast that the Christian always has in his mind. The apostle
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:11.200]   Paul is so often using it. He talks about now and then. Now I see in a glass darkly,
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:19.360]   and then face to face. He sees that this world is a passing world. Here we know a continuing
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:25.320]   city, but we seek one to come. It was the secret of Abraham, the secret of Joseph, the
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.640]   secret of Moses, all these men. Why did Moses give up that brilliant prospect that was there
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.880]   before him in Egypt and to lie himself and join himself to these miserable wretched people?
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:42.560]   Oh, he had his eye on the recompense of the reward. He saw him who is invisible. These
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.240]   men were all looking for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.520]   They had this view of life in this world as transient, evanescent, preparatory school,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:04.400]   nothing more. But still more wonderful is this. He being full of the Holy Ghost, looked
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:12.880]   up steadfastly into heaven. A Christian can do this. He can look up. He doesn't merely
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.600]   look at the world. He knows another dimension, another realm, the unseen, the spiritual.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:27.960]   He looked up and then he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened." It's only the Christian
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:35.720]   who knows this. He knows this by faith. He has these men realizing what he already knew.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.880]   And therefore the Christian, even in this life and in this world, can look ahead and
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:53.520]   see heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee. In life, in death, O Lord,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:03.280]   abide with me. The Christian knows there is another realm. There is a land of pure delights
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:10.840]   where saints immortal reign. He knows there is a realm in which the spirits of just men
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.560]   live perfectly, living and dwelling. And God is there, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:23.680]   and the glorious angels. He knows it's a reality and he's going to it. The glory that awaits
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:32.080]   him. He said, "I see the heavens opened now." But he being full of the Holy Ghost,
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:41.440]   looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God. Oh, what a difference, what
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.280]   a death when you see the glory of God. What's the malignity of men? What are stones? What's
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:55.320]   anything? The glory of the everlasting God. And he knows he's going to it, to see it
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:05.080]   in all its fullness and to enjoy it for all eternity. But in addition, you remember the
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:11.000]   other thing we are told is this, but he being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. I agree
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.440]   with all the old commentators who notice this fact that we are told here, not as we are
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.720]   generally told that our Lord was sitting at the right hand of God, but that he was standing
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:37.480]   at the right hand of God. And I agree with their interpretation of it, which is this,
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.800]   that it was the blessed Lord getting up, as it were, to look at his suffering servant
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:50.840]   and waiting to receive him. You know there's a hymn that puts this very well. Let me quote
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:42:01.800]   it to you. "Though now ascended upon high, he bends on earth a brother's eye, partaker
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:09.400]   of the human name. He knows the frailty of our frame, our fellow sufferer, yet retains
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:19.720]   a fellow feeling of our pains, and still remembers in the skies his tears, his agonies, and cries.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:26.640]   In every pain that rends the heart, the man of sorrows has a part, and sympathizes with
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:33.520]   our grief, and to the sufferer sends relief." That's what he was doing. He stood up, as
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.920]   it were, and he was showing his sympathy, and he was waiting to receive him. In other
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.840]   words, what C. Stephen saw was a fulfillment of one of the last things that our Lord had
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   promised his faithful followers. You remember John 14 at the beginning, "Let not your
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:57.680]   heart be troubled." "Ye believe in God, believe also in me. I go to prepare a place
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.080]   for you in my Father's house, and many mentions. If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.840]   I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.600]   again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also." All right, this
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:19.280]   is a part of it. He stands, waiting to receive him, this blessed servant who is following
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:25.440]   in his footsteps so gloriously, and even praying for his enemies as he dies, and who commits
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:35.320]   the keeping of his soul into his safe and glorious heavens. That's the kind of difference
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:42.040]   the Holy Ghost makes to us. He not only gives us a different understanding and puts a different
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:48.160]   spirit in us, he'll change our attitude towards the whole of life, and especially towards
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:55.440]   death. He turns it into just a little rivulet, standing between this world of sin and shame
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:04.760]   and evil and sorrow, and that glorious land that awaits the people of God.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.600]   But let me just make one last point, because it is the greatest and the most glorious of
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.840]   all. It is the Holy Spirit that makes this difference. We've seen the nature of the
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:24.400]   character of the difference, and thirdly and lastly, the secret, or the explanation of
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   the difference. What is it? Well, it's the very thing for which Stephen was on trial.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:38.840]   Why is he on trial? Because of what he believes concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. What is
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.440]   the work of the Spirit? The Spirit resisted by the natural men, the Spirit to whom the
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.320]   other men have yielded, and he's filled with him. Understanding, yes, but of what? Well,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:57.200]   I say of life, of history, of the Scriptures, but above all, of the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:03.400]   said, didn't he, that the Spirit would glorify him. He said, "He shall glorify me. He shall
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:09.320]   not speak out of from himself. He shall glorify me." And this is the supreme work of the
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:16.520]   Spirit, to display the Lord Jesus Christ to us, to enable us to see him and to know him.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.160]   And that's exactly what happened to Stephen. And that's why he's able to face death like
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.760]   this. Listen, this account, you know, it's so full of it, it's so marvelous. He being
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:32.320]   full of the Holy Ghost, looked steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God that
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:42.360]   might have crushed him. And Jesus, Jesus, standing on the right hand of God, and said,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:49.120]   "Behold, I see the heavens open." And the Son of Man, standing on the right hand of
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:58.400]   God. Oh, this is the most wonderful thing. He saw Jesus. Why does he call him Jesus here?
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:05.600]   Well, because, you see, this is the one who, though he is the Lord of glory, became man,
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:12.840]   Jesus. Thou shalt call his name Jesus. The one he saw was the one who was once lying
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:19.000]   as a little helpless babe in the manger in Bethlehem, Jesus. The one who, when he started
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.280]   on his public ministry at the age of thirty, constantly referred to himself as the Son
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:31.160]   of Man. It was the name he applied to himself. And he sees the Son of Man. What's it mean?
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:42.440]   Well, he sees a human form, the representative of mankind, the man, in whom everything is
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:49.400]   represented, all of man is represented. One who delighted to call himself the Son of Man.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:55.440]   He has authority, he has power. The affairs of man are in his hands. He is himself the
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:09.400]   man, Son of Man. And oh, the comfort and the consolation of knowing that, that we are not
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.360]   left to ourselves, we have a great high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:22.280]   infirmities, because he was tempted in all points like us, we are yet without sin. And
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:28.840]   there in the glory Stephen sees him, this Jesus, this Son of Man. And the moment he
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.240]   sees him, everything he's ever believed about him is verified. Why? Well, because he sees
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:41.840]   him standing at the right hand of God. What does this mean? Well, this means this. Jesus,
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.760]   Stephen had probably seen him many times, as most people who'd been in Jerusalem had
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.240]   seen him. Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet, the preacher, the one who was arrested, the
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.480]   one who staggered up Golgotha, the one who was nailed to a tree and died between the
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:00.960]   thieves. Jesus, whose body was taken down, dead, buried in a grave, stone rolled up.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:09.120]   Jesus, yes, but he sees him. What's it mean? Oh, he's risen from the dead. He's conquered
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:16.720]   death in the grave. He's ascended upon high, and he's been given the place and the station
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:26.440]   of the highest honor, even in the presence of God himself, at the right hand of God.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:32.560]   What a confirmation of all his faith. You and I may not have such a blessed confirmation,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.480]   but you see, we've got exactly the same faith as Stephen. Stephen hadn't had it until this
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.800]   point, but he knew it. He went on to strengthen it. That is what made him dare look at these
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:46.200]   men in whose hands his life was, and say, "You stiff-necked, uncircumcised lot!" He
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:51.520]   knew that infuriating them didn't matter. He knew these things. He's given a confirmation
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:59.160]   of them, and every one of us will get a confirmation. We shan't be left to ourselves in the agony
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.440]   of death. My dear friends, let me tell you, I remember
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:09.960]   standing at the bedside of a dying man, age 77 and more. In fact, he was converted at
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:16.520]   the age of 77. He lived one of the blackest, vilest lives a man could possibly live, drunkard,
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:22.880]   adulterer, wife-beater, even possibly a murderer. He'd lived a life of vice and sin. I saw
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:31.200]   that man converted at the age of 77. But what I saw much more wonderfully was that man's
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:37.720]   going like Stephen. I'll never forget it. His poor face was a mess of scars as the result
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:44.100]   of his fighting, quarreling, battles. But as I looked at him, his face was transfigured.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.520]   It began to shine with something of the glory of heaven. And then, I'll never forget him,
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:54.560]   just as he was going, a smile broke over his face, angelic, beatific, and he just held
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:02.680]   out his arms. What was happening? I have no hesitation in answering the question. He saw
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   Jesus waiting to receive him, and he stretched out his hands. This is it. You see, here he
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:18.760]   is at the right hand of God. And then he prays to him and he calls him, "Lord Jesus."
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.760]   He's Jesus, he's Son of Man, he's at the right hand of God, he's Lord. What does
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   this mean? Well, it just means that he's the conqueror of all our enemies. He's conquered
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:38.080]   death. He'd conquered sin and before that, and all his powers. But he's conquered the
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:44.160]   last enemy. Death has been vanquished. He's triumphed over it. He's taken the sting
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:51.680]   out of it. And now he says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   He is at the right hand of God. What's he doing? He's waiting until his enemies shall
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:02.440]   be made his footstool. He's the Lord of history. Everything is in his hands. He and
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.840]   he alone was big enough and strong enough to take that book that was sealed within and
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:12.400]   on the backside. He can tear the seal. The liar of the tribe of Judah, the one who was
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   triumphed over all the enemies of man and of God. And he is in heaven's highest place.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:27.760]   And whatever he may be permitting in the world tonight, and he permits things we don't
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.880]   understand. He permits tyrants to rise. He always has them on a limit. Down they go.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.200]   You're Hitler's, you know they never last. All the great tyrants of history have gone
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:44.560]   down, and any future tyrants will go down in the same way. He and he alone is king,
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:51.040]   and he'll reign universally. He's the coming king. He's the one who's going to return
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.120]   and wind up the affairs of this world and cast evil sin into hell, and hell itself into
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:10.480]   destruction. He is Lord of all. It's because he came and made himself so low. It was because
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.600]   he was obedient unto death, yea, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:23.000]   highly exalted him, and given him a name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.800]   every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:38.880]   earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:49.040]   And Stephen saw him, and he fell asleep. And any man who believes this message concerning
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:53:00.440]   this Lord Jesus Christ has nothing to fear in death. He can say with the apostle Paul,
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:08.480]   to me to live is Christ, to die is gain. Why? Well it means to be with Christ, which is
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:16.520]   far better. Oh yes, here Paul speaks, you see, he knew him so well, and here he is,
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:22.440]   an old man at the end of his life, and this is how he faces death. I have fought a good
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:28.200]   fight, I have finished my cause, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.840]   me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:44.200]   day, and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing. This isn't reserved
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:53.640]   only for special saints and martyrs. John Wesley used to boast of this, "Our people
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:54:02.320]   die well." It is the distinguishing mark of the Christian. He knows, he sees in a glass
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   darkly, even that is enough, but he knows that though he now does see only as in a glass
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:21.040]   darkly, he shall then see, face to face, and spend his eternity in the glorious presence
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.840]   of God. My dear friend, how do you face the prospect
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:34.400]   of death? Are you ready for it? Which of these two positions are you in? You are in one or
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:40.960]   the other, you know. You have either resisted the Spirit of God until this hour, or else
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:48.680]   he is in you. Which is it? Have you got an understanding of these things? What spirit
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:55.760]   is in you? How do you face death, the prospect of death? What if you are to die tonight?
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:06.280]   You don't know. It's a very uncertain world, accidents, diseases. Are you ready? Oh, let
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:13.160]   me put it to you like this. Stephen has been reviewing this great history, starting with
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:19.760]   Abraham and going on. Can you join Thomas Olivers in saying something like this? Remember,
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:28.200]   these words were written by a converted, tramp and drunkard. The God of Abraham, praise,
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:35.960]   who reigns enthroned above, the God of Abraham, ancient of everlasting days and God of love.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:44.320]   Jehovah, great I am by earth, and him confessed. I bow and bless this sacred name forever blessed.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:49.880]   All right, but can you say this? Here's the test. The God of Abraham, praise, at whose
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:57.720]   supreme command from earth I rise and seek the joys at his right hand. I all on earth
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:10.960]   forsake its wisdom, fame and power. And him, my only portion, make my shield and tower.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:19.440]   Can you say this? He by himself hath sworn I on his earth depend. I shall on eagles'
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:34.760]   wings abode to heaven ascend. I shall behold his face. I shall his power adore and sing
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   the wonders of his grace forevermore. Can you say that? Well, then can you join in saying
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:56.440]   this? The whole triumphant host give thanks to God on high. Hail, Father, Son and Holy
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:16.080]   Ghost. They ever cry, "Hail, Abraham's God!" And mine, can you say that? Is he your God?
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:22.680]   Have you ceased resisting the Spirit? Have you revealed yourself? Can you say, "Hail,
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:38.120]   Abraham's God!" And mine, I join the heavenly lays. All might and majesty are thine. And
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:50.440]   endless praise, my dear friend. Is Abraham's God your God? Is Joseph's God your God? Is
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:58:02.800]   the God of Moses your God? Have you listened to these men? They've all foretold his coming.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:09.400]   And he has come. Have you recognized Jesus to be the Son of God? Have you seen him as
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:15.480]   the Lamb of God taking away your sins? Have you laid your sins upon him? Have you surrendered
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:21.280]   yourself, your life to him? Is he the end of the law to you? And is your trust entirely
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   and only in him? If so, you've got a new understanding. You've got a new nature and
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:39.560]   spirit. You are not afraid of death. You know that he shall be upborn on eagle's wings
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:46.960]   and ascend into his glorious presence. And you are ready to say, "Hail, Abraham's God!"
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:58.080]   And mine, I join the heavenly lays. If you've never done it before, do it now. And be safe
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:07.960]   and be saved in time, in death, and for all eternity. Shall we sing that great hymn of
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:16.800]   Thomas Oliver's, hymn number 12, "The God of Abraham praised who reigns enthroned above,
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:21.760]   ancient of everlasting days, and God of love." Hymn number 12.
