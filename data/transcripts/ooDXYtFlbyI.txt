[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   Well, there are multiple ways to share the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.700]   You can open air preach to an audience, or you can just walk up to a stranger on the
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.840]   street with a tract and hope for a brief conversation.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.380]   Or you can invest in someone's life as a friend first, eventually leading them then
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.580]   to the gospel.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.060]   One approach does not preclude the others.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.340]   So what do different forms of evangelism look like in the life of Pastor John himself?
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.900]   At the recent Cross Conference, Pastor John fielded audience questions, and I wanted to
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.060]   share two of them with you today.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.340]   The first is from a young woman named Christy at the microphone.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340]   Here she is.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.500]   I'm curious how, whenever you're not in settings like this, how you share the gospel with people?
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500]   Like if you have five minutes or less, somebody you're checking out at Walmart or whatever,
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200]   to tell someone about Christ.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700]   What do you tell them?
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.260]   Well, let's just use real examples.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.460]   I'm in Minnesota, so I only do this about eight months out of the year.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460]   I call it jogging evangelism.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.980]   So I'm a jogger, and I mean really slow, like 13 minute miles, okay?
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.360]   And I jog through my neighborhood.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.940]   It's a very poor neighborhood, and I know where everything is.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.300]   I know where the homeless people are.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300]   I know where the people are under the bridge.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.060]   I know where they're getting up at 6 a.m. in the morning, and I just start running,
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.820]   and I'm praying, "God, show me somebody to do that."
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.060]   Five minutes, two minutes, whatever.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.060]   And they're easy.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.620]   I mean, most poor people are easy to talk to, right?
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.060]   It's rich people that think you're a jerk and get out of my life.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.420]   And I basically start by saying, "Hi, I'm John.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.420]   I live in the neighborhood.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.060]   I used to say I'm a pastor," and that helped, usually.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.860]   And I say, I jog and I pray for people.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.980]   How can I pray for you?
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.980]   Real standard opening.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.860]   They'll say, "Oh, I prayed for my girlfriend.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860]   She just left.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.180]   You know, she ditched me last night," or, you know, "I'm praying for," whatever.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.180]   You know, they pray.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.740]   I say, "Okay, I will do that.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.620]   Now may I tell you the best news in the world?"
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.620]   I just ask permission.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.460]   "Can I tell you the best news in the world?"
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.820]   As I say, "Do you know the best news in the world?"
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.180]   And they say, "No, what do you?"
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.660]   And then I just say, "The best news in the world is that God made you for His glory.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.420]   You and I don't love His glory.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.420]   We should, right?
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.420]   Do you love His glory?
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.420]   No, I don't.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.420]   Okay, you're guilty.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.340]   I'm guilty before God.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.780]   And God in mercy is willing to send Jesus His Son to die in our place so that His anger
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.660]   and wrath just doesn't have to fall on us.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.380]   And if we will abandon our sin and trust in Him, He will forgive all our sins and bring
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.940]   us into His fellowship."
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.340]   I mean, that's the gospel.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.940]   It's the 1 Corinthians 15, 3 gospel.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.980]   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.540]   And then we see where we go from there.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.100]   That may be the end of it.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.940]   If they look the least bit interested to talk, the more we go, but that's...
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.700]   What I just gave you up there is the gospel.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   Those four things.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700]   __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.340]   Several minutes later came then a question about campus evangelism and weighing the balance
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.180]   between impromptu tract evangelism on campus versus investing in friendship evangelism.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.540]   Which is a better opportunity for success?
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.860]   Here's how Pastor John responded to that question.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:48.460]   I don't know of any formula that can define or decide for you when you will take an urgent
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.220]   opportunity to share the gospel quickly and fully with a person versus cultivating a longer
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.620]   term relationship.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.860]   I don't know a formula.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.700]   Both are needed.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.640]   And I think what we need to do is check our hearts.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.040]   Is the reason I am cultivating, say, a half a dozen relationships in my dorm in the hopes
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.580]   that I will have more credibility and lead them to Jesus.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.980]   Is the reason I'm doing that instead of in my first three conversations going to the
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.700]   gospel because I'm afraid?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.500]   And if it's fear, we need to change our strategy.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.720]   Frankly, from my experience over the last 20 or 30 years, friendship evangelism, which
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:44.140]   is a beautiful thing, has, I think, discouraged people from doing what I do in jogging evangelism.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.140]   And here's the problem.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.700]   This is my experience anyway.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.900]   If you move into a neighborhood, say, and you've got neighbors on each side and you
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.180]   meet them, and you're just going to say, "I'm going to form a relationship and within a
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.140]   few months maybe the gospel will come up."
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.100]   And when it comes up in six months and they hear how urgent it is, they look at you funny
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.580]   and say, "Why did you wait to tell me about this?"
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.460]   In other words, the gospel itself carries in it the natural impulse to be urgent.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.540]   So I would just encourage you, pray earnestly for discernment as to whether or not in this
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.380]   moment within the second or third conversation you have with a new friend, you say something
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.420]   like, "Can we do lunch together and share each other's philosophy of life?
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.260]   You tell me what makes you tick, I'll tell you what makes me tick.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.900]   Just ask for permission."
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:59.580]   And one other thing, I think we err, I have erred in not pressing through to tell somebody,
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.660]   "I really want you to believe."
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.660]   We share the gospel de facto.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.420]   We tell them the facts, we offer it to them, and then we stop instead of looking them in
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.100]   the eye and say, "I love you.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.860]   I would like to spend eternity with you.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.260]   I want you to be a sister.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.220]   I want you to be a brother of mine.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   Would you?"
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.860]   And that would even give you tears at that moment.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.740]   Very few people ever meet a Christian who talks that way to them.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.460]   That's moving, the personal plea approach to friendship evangelism.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.420]   That was Pastor John at the Cross Conference earlier in the month, fielding audience questions.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.900]   Well, Pastor John has been on the move in January, the Cross Conference in Louisville,
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.100]   the G3 Conference in Atlanta, the BCS Pastors Conference, which concluded earlier this week.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.220]   It's been a full January, but we get him back in the studio late next week to record new
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.420]   episodes and I will get them to you as soon as possible.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.420]   Until then, we may have some guest episodes, we may not.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.020]   I'm walking by faith and not by sight during these first three months of 2019 with Pastor
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.300]   John's available time.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.460]   Not sure how the schedule will pan out, but do be looking for new episodes from Pastor
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.220]   John sometime around February 11th, I'd say.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.620]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.100]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.100]   Piper.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   We'll see you again shortly.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   [END]
