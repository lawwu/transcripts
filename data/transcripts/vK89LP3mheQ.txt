[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   This is Jonathan Catherwood of the MLJ Trust.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.640]   The MLJ Trust is a charity in the United States that preserves the 1600 audio sermons of the
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.640]   late Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.560]   Dr. Lloyd-Jones and his wife, Bethan Lloyd-Jones, had two daughters, Elizabeth, my mother, and
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.880]   Anne, my beloved aunt, and each of them had three children.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.240]   So Elizabeth had Christopher, Bethan Jane, and myself, and my aunt Anne had Elizabeth,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   Rhiannon, and Adam.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.680]   Alas, my cousins were born too late to be in these home movies, which were mainly filmed
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.040]   between the late 1950s and the late 1960s, but we thought the people who follow Dr. Martin
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.280]   Lloyd-Jones might have some interest in seeing what he was like outside of the pulpit.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.640]   As a grandfather, he was very warm and loving and gentle, and these are the videos where
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.900]   we see him smiling and relaxed.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.160]   And for many people who watch this video, they will have been at Westminster Chapel
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.280]   at some point during his 30 years there.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.040]   I'll try and keep the voiceovers to a minimum, but just to point out who is who, and we hope
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.680]   you enjoy it.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.240]   This was a family gathering for what we think was my great-grandmother's 92nd birthday
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.520]   in the early '60s.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.440]   My grandmother, Bethan Lloyd-Jones, is in the middle, and coming into the frame on the
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   right is my mother, Elizabeth, and my sister, Bethan Jane.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   There's our birthday girl.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.920]   She lived to be 93 years old.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   Here's the family.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160]   You see my grandfather, Martin Lloyd-Jones, on the steps.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:38.120]   That's my lovely Aunt Anne and my mother, the two sisters together.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   Here's a day out.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.160]   My grandfather was never without a tie, never without a hat, no matter what the weather
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   is.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.640]   Here's Bethan and my mother.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.140]   And here is Bethan sitting on my grandfather's knee.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.920]   He was a very sweet and gentle grandfather, and we were always on and off his knees, as
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.140]   were my cousins in the early '70s.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.140]   That's me being annoying.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.320]   Apparently, I was ill that day, and that's my excuse.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.140]   And my grandmother was always in the house, and with my cousins as well as my brother
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.140]   and my sister.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:35.540]   You just couldn't get a sweeter grandmother.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.780]   We're a little older now.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.060]   That was my brother running into the frame.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.700]   That's my sister.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.860]   That is me as a little boy, trying to let go of my grandfather's hand to run towards
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.860]   the camera.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.300]   They took us on a lot of outings when we spent time together in the Easter and over the summer
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.700]   holidays.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:09.420]   And that is the smile that I remember.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.980]   He was always with a book, two to three hours every afternoon, reading books in the library.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.300]   And he also encouraged us to read and was interested in reading what we were reading,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.940]   no matter how rubbish it was.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.540]   He liked to know what we were doing, what we were reading, and to take an interest in
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.740]   it.

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.740]   It was very rare to see my grandmother without a hat, not just on Church and Sunday.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740]   You will notice coming up in this shot that even though my grandfather liked to lead in
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.060]   the pulpit, when it came to walking around the gardens, my grandmother had quite a lot
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.140]   to say.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.820]   She was a terrific woman.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   She was one of the earliest of her generation to become a medical doctor in the 1920s.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.700]   She had 27 proposals of marriage, and my grandfather was the first one, and he was the last one.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   He just kept going.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.020]   You see him being turned there by my grandmother.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.740]   But he fell in love almost immediately and just hung in and hung in until she finally
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740]   said yes.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.240]   In the background, you can see my grandfather playing mini golf with my brother and my sister
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   and myself.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.580]   He was a great fan of sports and would take us out in the afternoon and play this game
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:55.020]   in croquet where he was easily the best in the family.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.940]   We do hope that you've enjoyed these home movies, and thank you for watching them.
