[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.460]   All right, who do we got?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.760]   - All right, next up we have Shane McGrath.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280]   I'm pretty sure he's submitted a question before
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.360]   and he's basically got a lot of jobs.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.580]   He's doing a lot of juggling
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.800]   and he's got a specific question about that.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.880]   - Hi Cal, my name is Shane and I work
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.220]   as an operations analyst in the medical device field.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.480]   I'm a big fan of your work
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.740]   and credit the embrace of Deep Work principles
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.480]   as a catalyst for my last two promotions.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.540]   So I first and foremost just wanna express
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.400]   my utmost gratitude to your work
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.440]   and I look forward to your future work as well.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.940]   What I wanna ask you is your advice and strategies
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.160]   for shifting gears between multiple domains.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.480]   I have several interests including writing,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.720]   learning to code, investing, data analysis,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.080]   cooking and playing guitar, which I all tend to.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.980]   They all feel rewarding in different ways
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.280]   and I guess I just operate as a right-brained guy
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880]   who loves to throw coals in the fire.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.160]   Assuming I keep this juggling act going,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.780]   do you have any tips or strategies
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.960]   that help to shift gears between work in different domains?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380]   When I write, it seems like the optimal state
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.200]   is quite different than when I'm coding
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000]   in JavaScript for example.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.300]   They just seem to hit different.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.220]   I just wonder how I could do a better job
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.300]   with managing this juggling act I'm in the middle of.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.400]   Much appreciated, Cal, thanks a lot.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.880]   - Well, I mean, Shane, my advice here is
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   if you're struggling juggling lots of balls,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   the best solution is to take out a bunch of the balls.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.040]   That's much easier than trying to learn
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.080]   how do I juggle five balls?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.420]   That's hard to do.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.040]   Two balls is easier.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   So instead of trying to figure out how to juggle five balls,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.920]   you could get rid of three
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   and that's what I think is the issue here.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.480]   That's too many things.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.740]   That's too many things.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.440]   The overhead of having that many things
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   is probably counterbalancing a lot of the value.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   So if we wanna see what's a more reasonable load,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.560]   and we're talking here,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.720]   these are all sort of out of work, leisure type pursuits.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.920]   There's a few different things.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   If we're looking through the different deep life buckets,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   there's like a few different things
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.640]   that are pulling at your time, especially outside of work.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.260]   I mean, first of all, there's the community bucket.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.200]   I mean, serving your family, serving your friends,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   being a leader in your community.
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.540]   Enjoying and savoring times with people you care about.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.860]   Like that actually needs a lot of time.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.940]   That's a default.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.140]   That's already taking up a lot of time.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.000]   We have constitution.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.260]   You gotta take care of your body.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.180]   It's the best way also of keeping anxiety low,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.540]   especially during difficult times.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.540]   And it keeps you with more options
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.820]   for doing things with your life going forward.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.900]   And that takes time.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.820]   So now we don't have a ton of time left.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.140]   Then you wanna throw in there,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.740]   if we wanna have the celebration bucket
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.580]   or under contemplation,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.440]   you wanna throw in there just having
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.460]   high quality present leisure experiences.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.060]   Just really enjoying a movie, really enjoying a dinner,
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.120]   really enjoying a sunset while you're out for a walk
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   and that type of just present gratitude generating moment.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.980]   Now we're really getting down
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.100]   to a small amount of free time,
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.180]   which honestly I think the right load there
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.380]   is there's a primary hobby that you work on over time.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.200]   So you get the satisfaction of mastery
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.460]   and of developing a really refined taste in one area.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.260]   So if you get really good at guitar,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.900]   you don't just get the benefit of the mastery
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.740]   of playing your guitar well,
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.700]   you get the benefit of really being able to appreciate
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.580]   and understand other good guitar players.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.100]   So it's a gift that keeps on giving.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.800]   And then maybe have a secondary hobby
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.620]   that you're messing around with.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.660]   I'm learning how to cook this season.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260]   And then I'm really busy and I'm doing no secondary thing.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.360]   And then I'm messing around with code.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.340]   I'm gonna make like a video game for my kids.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.220]   And then I'm doing nothing because I'm busy.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.740]   And you have that secondary slot.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.540]   I honestly think that's really what people
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.820]   more or less have time for.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.060]   And my worry is if you try to have
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.900]   five different leisure activities,
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.040]   those other core deep life areas like community,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.380]   like constitution, like just present celebration,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.580]   they're gonna get squeezed out and that's to your detriment.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.360]   And the overhead of just switching back and forth
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.020]   between these things are gonna make you more anxious
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.740]   than you get benefit from them.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.720]   So I'm not sure if that's the answer you wanna hear,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.340]   but that's the answer I am gonna give right now
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.340]   is if you do less, this might sound paradoxical,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.080]   but if you do less, you're actually going to experience
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.900]   more good things in your life.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.060]   (upbeat music)
