[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   Unfortunately, the following message by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones was recorded before conventional
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.340]   recording tape became available, and it is an example of early recording using paper
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.340]   tape.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.300]   Unfortunately, due to the passage of time, this has now started to break down and this
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800]   will account for the burbling sound you will hear during parts of this recording.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720]   It has been restored digitally and we hope that this slight disturbance will not spoil
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080]   too much your enjoyment of this historic message.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.880]   Here's Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.680]   We at the moment are looking at the work of regeneration.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.600]   Now I keep on reminding you of the order in which we are taking these things, because
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   to me that's not only a very fascinating matter, but has its very real importance if we are
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.480]   to have these things clearly in our minds.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.080]   The work has been done by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.520]   The work of the Holy Spirit now is to bring that to man.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.800]   He does so by causing it to be preached.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.360]   It is he who calls the preacher, it is he who gives him the message, and it is he who
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   empowers him to speak it.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.360]   But that is a call that goes out to all, it's universal.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.640]   The offer of the gospel is to all men.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   All men everywhere are commended to repent and to turn to God in Jesus Christ.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.400]   But it's clear that all do not do so.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   Some do, some don't.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.280]   And therefore we ask the question, why is it some do?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.960]   They are the ones that should concern us.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.880]   Why is it that some do?
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.160]   Because by nature no one would.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.400]   We are all born in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   We are all dead in trespasses and in sins.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.400]   The natural mind understandeth not the things of the Spirit of God, and so on.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   Well, the answer to the scripture is that the call becomes effectual in the case of
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.960]   these people, and we dealt with it.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.480]   Well, then we ask the question, how exactly does the call become effectual?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.880]   And last Friday I began answering that question by saying that the call becomes effectual
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.400]   as the result of the work of regeneration.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.880]   It is by this work that the Holy Spirit does in men, which we call regeneration, that the
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.780]   call becomes effectual.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.600]   It becomes effectual because there is now in this person a principle which was not there
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.080]   before and which enables him to respond to this spiritual truth, this divine truth that
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   comes to him.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.920]   And that is the difference between the believer and the unbeliever, a man who is saved and
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.000]   a man who is not saved.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.760]   The natural mind, he is in the flesh.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   He is fleshly, he is not spiritual, and that is why these things mean nothing to him.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.560]   But they mean everything to the other man, and that is because he is now spiritual, and
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   he is spiritual as the result of regeneration.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120]   And we began considering what the Bible teaches us about regeneration.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.760]   We considered the terms that it uses, for instance.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.400]   And then we came to examine its real nature, and this we defined as being a change in the
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.360]   fundamental disposition of men.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   It isn't a mere change in some of the faculties of the soul.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.760]   It's something behind it.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.520]   It is this fundamental disposition.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   That's the thing that's changed.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.880]   And that in turn, of course, governs the mind and the heart and the will.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.120]   So it's a change there, down in the depths, at the point at which the whole personality
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.760]   is of necessity going to be involved.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.560]   And we ended up by saying that it's an instantaneous work, it's a work which happens in the subconscious.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.480]   We are not exactly aware when it happens.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.320]   The moment we are aware of it, it's already happening.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   We are aware of life, where life is something that comes out of generation.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.520]   And therefore we decided, of course, that it is done by God, and that man is entirely
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.880]   passive in it.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.480]   Well now, I want to emphasize again this evening as we proceed with our consideration, the
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.400]   profound nature and character of the change.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.080]   It's something that's emphasized everywhere in the Scripture.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.320]   Sometimes it talks about our being given a new heart.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.000]   And heart in Scripture generally means not merely the seat of the affections, it means
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.320]   the very center, the seat of the man's whole personality.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.560]   So when it talks about giving us a new heart, or a clean heart, it's talking about what
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360]   I described last Friday as the fundamental disposition.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.720]   I think the term disposition is better than heart because people from current usage tend
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.240]   almost inevitably to think of heart as meaning only the seat of affections.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.960]   But if you use the term heart as the Bible uses it, and if you mean by that the very
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.400]   center of the personality, the thing that controls and determines everything else, well
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.360]   then it is of course a most excellent term.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.400]   And the change is something that is made there.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.800]   Now this whole question of regeneration, as we saw last week in considering what our Lord
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.000]   said to Nicodemus, is of course a great mystery.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.120]   It's a miracle, it's supernatural.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.780]   Our Lord compared it to the wind in order to get Nicodemus and all of us through Nicodemus
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.400]   to see that there is a sense in which we just can't understand it, finally.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.640]   "Thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.640]   goeth."
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.200]   So is everyone that is born of the Spirit.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.800]   And yet it does behoove us, as I'm never tired of saying, to go as far as we can.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.000]   And for myself I would pass on to you what I at Innerit regard as the best illustration
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.160]   I've ever come across in an attempt to make this wonderful change that God works in the
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.680]   soul more or less comprehensible to us.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.080]   It's an illustration that is suggested, of course, by the Scripture itself.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.400]   And the illustration is that of grafting, the whole process of grafting.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.240]   I think it puts it more clearly than anything else.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.600]   You know what's often done.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.400]   A man may be anxious to grow a certain type of pear, for instance.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.120]   The same thing can be done with roses.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.920]   You may want to grow a tea rose of a special variety.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.320]   Well, the way in which it's often done is this.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.240]   You are given just a graft, a portion, a shoot of a particular variety of pear or of plum
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   or rose, if you like.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.360]   And then what the man does is he takes that and he grafts that into a wild pear tree or
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   into a wild rose, as the case may be.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.560]   Let's take it in the case of a pear tree.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.840]   A man wants to grow a particular type of William pear, shall we say.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.720]   Well, he gets this shoot.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.560]   Then he takes a common wild pear tree and he hacks into it.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.000]   Then into that wound which he's made, as it were, into the tree, he puts this shoot,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   this sprout.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.160]   Then he binds it together.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.520]   And it is in that way that eventually that man will have this wonderful pear tree that
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.760]   will be producing nothing but this particular variety of pear.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   But in the meantime he has many things to do.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.920]   He doesn't merely leave it at that.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.800]   What happens is that the strength and the power, as it were, and the life and the sap
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:18.480]   that comes up through that wild pear tree will enter into this shoot and it will produce,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.600]   yes but below the level of the graft, the wild pear tree will still tend to throw out
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   its own wild shoots and branches and want to produce its own fruit.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.280]   So the gardener or the horticulturist, he has to lop off these natural branches.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.880]   He has to cut them, prune them right down, and if he only does that, a time will arrive
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.360]   when he will have nothing of that tree but this wonderful type of pear that he's anxious
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.280]   to grow.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.080]   You see, at first you seem to have two natures in the one tree.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.760]   And if you prune off the old, the new will gradually master the whole and you will eventually
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.720]   have a pear tree which is producing the type of fruit that you want.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.080]   Now that seems to me to be incomparably the best illustration that has ever been used
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.280]   with regard to this matter.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.760]   You see, you're putting new life in, so that at one stage you've got one tree but
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.080]   with two natures, the cultured, cultivated nature, the wild nature.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.720]   Yes, but if you just, I say, see to it that the strength of that tree isn't allowed
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   to go into these wild branches.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.040]   By pruning them off, see that it's going into the other, not only will that be strengthened
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   and bear its fruit, it will gradually conquer and master.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.360]   It seems to have the power to send its life down into the old until eventually you have
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.480]   this excellent pear tree that you desired at the beginning.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.040]   Now that is, of course, a good illustration of what happens.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   No illustration is perfect.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.240]   It does seem to me that it goes as far as we can possibly go.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.680]   That is what happens, in a sense, in regeneration.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.440]   There is still only one man, there are not two men, one man.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.480]   But this new nature is put into him.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.800]   He is called upon to modify his members that are on the earth.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.720]   He's got to go on pruning and keeping under that which belongs to the old, and as he does,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.600]   this new life will grow and develop and produce fruit, and the new men will be increasingly
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   inevitable.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.400]   Now, I'm anxious to stress this point because I think you'll find that very often there
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   is not only serious confusion about this question of regeneration.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.760]   I'm afraid we can even go further and say that people who regard themselves as truly
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   evangelical and very evangelical, sometimes unwittingly in their teaching, deny the truth
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.920]   and the doctrine of regeneration, it seems to me, altogether.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   Now, I therefore want to put this very strongly in this form.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:20.800]   In regeneration, a real change takes place, and that within us.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   It is as definite as the illustration puts it in the case of Grafton.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:36.320]   I mean by that, that it isn't merely a change in our relationship to truth or to a person.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.320]   It's more than that.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:47.360]   A change takes place in us, not outside us only, not in our relationships, nor merely
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.800]   while we remain abiding in Christ.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:55.840]   Now, there's a very familiar teaching about sanctification which puts itself to us like
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   this.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   You're probably familiar with it.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.000]   The illustration is taken of a poker.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.640]   There is the poker.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's cold, it's black, and it's hard and can't be bent.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.480]   Very well, you take that poker, we are told, and you put it into a fire and you leave it
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   in the fire.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:23.960]   And in the fire, the poker becomes red, it becomes hot, and it becomes malleable.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   You can bend it.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.760]   Ah, yes, we are told, that's all right.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:36.580]   The poker remains red and hot and malleable only as long as it's kept in the fire.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.520]   That is the illustration of abiding in Christ.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.240]   And as long as you abide in Christ, there will be this new life, they say, and this
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   new way of living.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:50.320]   Oh, yes, they say, but if you take that poker out of the fire and leave it out of the fire,
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.720]   it returns to precisely what it was before.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.880]   It becomes black, it becomes cold, it becomes hard.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   It reverts completely.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.800]   Now, all that, you see, is taught in the interests of the importance of abiding in Christ.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   Yes, but surely it goes so far as to deny the doctrine of regeneration altogether, because
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   it tells us that if a man doesn't abide in Christ, he reverts to the condition that he
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   was in before, exactly as he was before.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.240]   Now, that, I suggest, is a denial of the doctrine of regeneration.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.200]   A man who is a Christian and who is born again may backslide.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.360]   He doesn't abide in Christ in this mystical sense, but I say that even then, he does not
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.280]   return to where he was before.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.240]   The man is born again, there is this new principle in him, the change has taken place and the
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.160]   change is still there.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.120]   He's not manifesting it fully, but it's there.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.680]   And we mustn't describe that man as reverting to the precise position he was in before.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.280]   It's exactly the same with that other illustration about the life belt.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.360]   The sinner is compared to a man in the sea who can't swim.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.600]   But we are told that as long as he puts on the life belt, he's held up.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.480]   He's held up by the life belt, yes, but if he wriggles out of the life belt, we are told,
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.480]   he'll sink to the bottom.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.560]   Now there again, it seems to me, is a denial of the doctrine of regeneration.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.720]   Because what it tells us is that when the man is not abiding, that he reverts to exactly
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.440]   where he was before, as if nothing had happened to him and no change had taken place in him.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:41.480]   Now, the doctrine of regeneration teaches that the change is a change which takes place
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.160]   not merely in a man's relationship to the Lord, or in his relationship to truth.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.640]   It is something that God does within him.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.360]   It is a new life put in the man, a new principle of life and of being.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.840]   And therefore, of course, it is something which grows and develops and becomes progressively
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   greater.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.480]   Listen to the Apostle Paul saying that.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.120]   In the last verse of the third chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians, he
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.400]   puts it like this.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:20.120]   "But we all," he says, "with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   into the same image from glory to glory."
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.040]   Now there, you see, is development and growth.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   Why?
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.480]   Well, because this principle of life has been put in.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.840]   We are changed, as the hymn puts it, based upon that verse, "from glory into glory,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   till in heaven we take our place."
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.280]   The work is within us.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   And we are changed.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.880]   We are no longer the same.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   Now all these scriptural terms, surely, should have saved us from that particular error that
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:00.480]   is illustrated in the pictures of the poker and the life belt.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.920]   It is a rebirth.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.760]   It is a new birth.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.560]   It is being born again.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.240]   It's a new creation.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's in man.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.600]   He's virtually a new man.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.400]   Now we can't emphasize that too strongly, because it's not only something that is clearly
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.840]   taught in Scripture.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.920]   When we come on later to deal with the doctrine of sanctification, we will of course see of
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.480]   necessity how important it is that we understand this particular teaching about regeneration.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.760]   Because if we don't, when we come to sanctification, as I've been saying, we shall unconsciously
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:45.720]   be denying the doctrine of regeneration altogether, in our anxiety to get men to abide in Christ.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.520]   It is right to exhort people to abide in Christ, and we should do so when we come to that doctrine.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:58.240]   But we must never put it in such a way as to give the impression that regeneration simply
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.640]   consists in a new relationship to Christ, that is, to introduce a very real confusion.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:14.320]   Well very well, having emphasized the profound inward character of the change, let me go
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.840]   on to ask a question.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   Why is this change absolutely essential?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.600]   On what grounds have we the right to say that it is an essential change?
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.120]   Well first of all, Scripture teaches that.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.160]   You remember again what our Lord said to Nicodemus, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.960]   man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.160]   Then he says it again, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot even
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.040]   see the kingdom of God."
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   He can't even see it.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.000]   The rebirth is an absolute, utter essential.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.960]   A man can't even see the kingdom, leave alone enter it, unless he has been born again.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.760]   Get Paul teaching the same thing in Galatians 6.15.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:10.160]   In Christ Jesus he says, "Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth anything but a
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   new creature."
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.280]   That's the only thing that matters, is this new creation.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.240]   Not circumcision or the absence of it, the new creature, the new creation.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:28.000]   And again Paul in Ephesians 4.24 says the same thing, when he says about this new man,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.040]   "Which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   That's the same thing.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.680]   But you know, in many ways, one of the most important texts in this connection is Hebrews
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   12.14.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:55.440]   "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord."
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.020]   Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.940]   Holiness is absolutely essential.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:09.120]   And mark you, holiness there doesn't really mean a sanctification that you may receive
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.280]   or may not receive.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   Without holiness no man shall, can see the Lord.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.320]   So it's no use saying that there are some Christians who have received sanctification
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.680]   and some who haven't, and that those who haven't are still going to heaven.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.160]   Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.680]   It's impossible.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.260]   And it is in regeneration that this holiness is implanted in us in this new life.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:42.040]   It is a holy life, a holy principle that is placed within us.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.800]   Well now there are the explicit statements of Scripture, but there are other statements
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.960]   of Scripture which really teach the same thing very definitely by implication.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.000]   Eternal life is defined as a knowledge of God.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.240]   This is life eternal, that they might know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   hast sent.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.800]   Our Lord says that he has come that they might have life and that they might have it
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   more abundantly.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   He has come to give us eternal life.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:16.520]   And that is eternal life, this knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom he has sent.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:24.640]   Well now that in itself again makes regeneration an utter absolute necessity.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.640]   God is holy, God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.400]   Very well, life eternal is to know him and to have fellowship with him.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.760]   And therefore it of necessity means that my nature must be corresponding.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.800]   There must be that in me which corresponds to that and can enjoy that.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.080]   Yes but by nature we know that man as the result of the fall and as the result of sin
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   is the exact opposite of that.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.000]   And that is why again our Lord puts it so plainly in speaking to Nicodemus.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.560]   Nicodemus was trying to understand and thought he could go from where he was to the next
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   position.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:12.200]   No, no, says our Lord, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.320]   of the spirit is spirit.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.760]   And they have no correspondence.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.240]   There is nothing in common between them at all.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.240]   You cannot mix the flesh and the spirit.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.980]   It simply can't be done.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.120]   That is why he says you must be born again.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.760]   It's not his arguing, he says, the thing is impossible.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.720]   There is the spiritual, there is the sinful, that which belongs to the flesh.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.560]   And you cannot bring them together.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.380]   You must be born again.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.240]   You must be made spiritual.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.320]   Obviously.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   You see the character of God and the character of men as the result of sin makes regeneration
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:58.600]   an utter absolute essential because there is no such thing as a divine spark in men.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.040]   Of course the people who believe in a divine spark don't believe in regeneration and they're
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.080]   perfectly consistent with themselves.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.560]   But it does seem to me to be rather odd that people who denounce the doctrine of the divine
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.520]   spark nevertheless seem to think that there is something in men which can do a great deal
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   and which doesn't make regeneration an absolute necessity and that at the very beginning.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.880]   In other words, I am contending for this that regeneration must come at this particular
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:36.000]   stage because if it is possible for me to do something which will eventually lead to
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.200]   my regeneration, well then I say I don't need regeneration.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.400]   If I by myself as I am as a result of the fall and as a result of sin can appreciate
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.640]   spiritual truth, can appreciate the gospel and say yes I'm going to pay attention to
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:58.000]   that and then as a result of my paying attention I am born again and given the gift of life,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.080]   well I say I don't need the gift if I've already got the ability and the power and the discrimination
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.480]   to recognize such truth and to desire such truth.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.960]   But the fact is of course that I haven't such a power.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.640]   Man as a result of the fall and as a result of sin doesn't desire this truth.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.760]   He is at enmity against God.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.120]   He is opposed to God.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:26.880]   He is an enemy, says Paul, and an alien in his mind through wicked works.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.000]   He hates the law of God.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.720]   He has nothing to do with God.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.320]   He is carnal.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.640]   He is carnally minded.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.240]   He minds the things of the flesh and these things have no appeal for him.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:47.160]   So that regeneration is not only essential, it is essential at the beginning.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.680]   You can have nothing without it.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:55.240]   It is impossible for anything to happen in man which can make him a Christian until regeneration
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   has taken place.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.800]   So it's not only essential, it is essential at the very beginning.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.920]   Now then that brings us on to the next question.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.960]   How exactly is it brought about in us?
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.200]   And here is an interesting subject.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   I don't want to waste time on this, but it isn't merely a question of the moral influence
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   of the truth.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.800]   Those who are not evangelical, those who don't believe in this work of God, of course they
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.360]   regard it as just a moral influence.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.280]   They say a man listens to the gospel and he gets under its influence and its power and
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.840]   it changes him.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.280]   Ideas, he likes the ideas and he takes hold of the ideas and the ideas have their effect
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.800]   upon him and thus the effect of ideas and of truth is such that he becomes a different
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   man, he's changed.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.360]   But that isn't it.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.680]   We are talking about something that happens down in the depths of a man's personality
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.920]   that changes him.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.760]   It's not a moral influence.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.240]   Moral influence of course can make a great difference to men.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.400]   Moral influence can make men change their ideas, it can make a man change his way of
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.600]   living, it can make a drunkard a sober man.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.840]   It's often done it, you can present arguments and the argument may come home.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.920]   A man can give up drink completely and become a very sober man and a temperance advocate
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.760]   and Christ has not been mentioned at all.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.080]   But suddenly the moral appeal, the moral influence has come to him.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.620]   And so that can be elaborated all along the line.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:31.400]   And under the moral effect of truth and the moral influence of ideas, men can produce
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.280]   in themselves a great change and it is mainly produced by this influence of the truth upon
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   them.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   That isn't what we're dealing with.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.960]   Secondly, I must indicate that it's not produced by baptism either.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:51.920]   Now you're familiar with this, it's an old controversy, an old source of discussion.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.840]   The Roman Catholic Church teaches of course that regeneration is produced and accomplished
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.720]   only through the instrumentality of baptism.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.200]   You see, they not only say that baptism does it, they say that nothing does it but baptism.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.280]   You must be baptized before you can be regenerated.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.840]   I don't want to anticipate it, but let's get it clear at this point.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:26.040]   In baptism they teach that our sins are forgiven, our moral nature is changed and renewed within
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:33.920]   us, we are told that we are delivered from the inherent power and defilement of original
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.200]   sin.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Baptism does that.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:42.920]   You remember as the result of the fall, and there's a connection with Adam, we are all
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.240]   defiled as the result of his sin.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.800]   And the power of sin has entered in the Father.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:58.360]   Now they say when a child is baptized, it is delivered from the inherent power and pollution
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.120]   of original sin.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.440]   All that is inherited from Adam is washed away, blotted out.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:11.960]   And not only that, by baptism we are made sons and heirs of God.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.920]   So they teach that regeneration takes place through the act of baptism.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:26.840]   The Anglo-Catholics, of course, teach exactly the same thing, baptismal regeneration.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:34.120]   And strange though it may seem, on some counts the same is true of the Lutherans.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.680]   Luther never quite got rid of this, and his followers haven't got rid of it.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.120]   They specifically do teach baptismal regeneration.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.920]   There is one difference between their view of it and the Roman Catholics.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.480]   The Catholic says that you can't be regenerate without it.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:58.240]   The Lutherans say you can, but the usual, normal manner is by means of baptism.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.480]   Well, we do not teach that.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   We say that it is not by baptism, that there is scriptural evidence to prove abundantly
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.440]   the book of Acts without going outside it, that the people who were baptized were those
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.000]   who gave evidence that they were already born again.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.120]   They were baptized because they had been born again.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.040]   It was given as a sign and a seal to them because they had produced evidence of the
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   new birth.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:30.160]   But to us a much more interesting and fascinating question is this one.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.120]   What is the relationship of regeneration to the Word, the Word that is preached?
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.720]   Because there are a number of texts that suggest that our regeneration takes place through
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.440]   and by means of the Word.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.800]   Let me suggest them to you.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:50.680]   James 1.18, "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:59.720]   He begat us, you notice, with or by the word of truth.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:07.800]   Then you've got 1 Peter 1.23, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.920]   by the word of God."
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.680]   It suggests that the instrument is the Word.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:19.600]   But surely in both these cases, what is rarely said is this.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.800]   You remember that last week I drew a distinction between the act of generation and the coming
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   to birth.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.720]   The act of generation is one act.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.280]   There may be a long interval between that and the actual coming to the birth.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.080]   Now I suggest to you that both these texts I've quoted are concerned about the bringing
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.920]   to the birth.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.880]   And it is the Word that certainly does that.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:50.280]   It is the effectual call that comes through the medium of the Word that, as it were, brings
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.020]   the seed of life to life and the birth takes place.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.560]   But if you keep in your mind the distinction between the generation and the actual coming
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.400]   or begetting in a state of birth, I think you'll see the difference.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:12.600]   And that the Word is used not in the act of generating, but in the bringing out into life
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.560]   that which had already been implanted or placed within.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:24.880]   Then there are others who at this point quote the parable of the sower and the different
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.920]   types of ground, you remember.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   And they would emphasize that the life is in the seed and so on.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.360]   But surely the whole point of that parable of the sower is to emphasize the character
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.240]   of the nature of the ground into which the seed is put.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.080]   That's the whole point of the parable, isn't it?
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.320]   Is it stony ground?
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.760]   Is it encompassed by thorns and so on?
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.340]   Or is it good ground?
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.760]   In other words, the teaching there is this, that it is that fundamental something which
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.680]   we call the disposition that really matters.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.520]   And if that has been changed and put right, well then when the Word comes it will be effectual.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.680]   It will lead to the result, it will yield the fruit.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.240]   Indeed the scripture, as I've already suggested on previous occasions, does seem to teach
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   that quite explicitly.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.080]   Take for instance John 6, 65.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:30.320]   "Therefore said I unto you, says our Lord, that no man can come unto me except it were
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.480]   given him of my Father."
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.680]   Now there were the people, you remember, hearing the same word, the same word was preached
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   to them.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.400]   Some come, some go away.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   What's the difference?
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.920]   "Well, it's this," he says, "it is given to them of my Father.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:54.100]   No man can come unto me except it were given him of my Father."
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.920]   And again I would remind you of what we are told about Libya.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.680]   It was because the Lord had opened her heart that she attended unto the things that were
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   spoken of Paul and received the Word.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.060]   It was the act of the Lord in opening her heart that leads to her reception of the Word.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.680]   It wasn't the Word that opened her heart.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.520]   It was the Lord who opened her heart and then she receives the Word.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.760]   That surely must be the order.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.800]   And the argument of 1 Corinthians chapter 2, especially verses 12 to 15, obviously teaches
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   the same thing.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:38.040]   But there are two final arguments about this which are of not only great importance, but
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.360]   it does seem to me are of very great interest.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.520]   What about the Old Testament saints?
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.420]   Now when we were dealing with the doctrine of the covenant, we were at great pains to
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:58.520]   emphasize that the Old Testament saints are in the same position as we are.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.220]   There's only one covenant in the Old and in the New.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.720]   And you and I today are the children of Abraham because we are the children of faith.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.800]   Abraham is our father because we are children of faith.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.240]   Difference of course in the administration of the covenant in the Old and in the New,
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.400]   but only one great covenant of grace.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.600]   And our Lord of course tells us that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be in the kingdom and
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.560]   others will come from the East and so on and from the West and these Jews will be left
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.080]   outside.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.520]   In other words, the Old Testament saints were born again.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.160]   David was born again.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.680]   He was a new man, a new creature.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   And so were the patriarchs, so were the prophets, these Old Testament saints.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.240]   You remember how the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it at the end of chapter
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   12.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:03.760]   He said they didn't receive the promise in full.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.840]   You remember his argument, he says that it was kept back so that they should not, as
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.600]   it were, run ahead of us.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   Here it is.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.280]   "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise, God
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.560]   having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.840]   So we are made perfect together.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   But as the seed of Abraham and the children of Abraham, we are in the same position.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:39.000]   Well, if those Old Testament saints were regenerate as they must have been, it is clear that it
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.320]   isn't the Word that actually performs the act of regeneration.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.040]   It's clear that it isn't something that is immediate through the Word, but immediate.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.640]   It was the Spirit of God that dealt with them and operated upon them.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:03.160]   The other argument is the argument about children, especially about infants.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:11.640]   Now we all believe, do we not, that there are infants and children who have gone and
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.680]   who will go to heaven and spend their eternity in the presence of God, in exactly the same
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.920]   way as all of whom we can say that we know that they were saved and we saw and witnessed
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.080]   their conversion?
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   Now how can a child, how can an infant be saved?
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.320]   Obviously every infant needs to be saved.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.720]   If you believe in the doctrine of the Fall and in the doctrine of original sin, you must
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:48.360]   believe that every child born into this life was born in sin and shaken in iniquity.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.960]   That they are all born dead in trespasses and in sin, they all inherit original sin
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.640]   and original guilt from Adam, even as we do, every child that is born.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.400]   How can any child therefore be saved?
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.720]   How can any child ever go to heaven?
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:12.000]   Now if you want to say and to insist upon the fact that regeneration always follows
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   upon hearing the Word and believing it and accepting it, how can an infant be saved?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.880]   There is no hope for such an infant.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.680]   The infant is unconscious.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.760]   The infant can't receive truth.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.200]   It hasn't the ability, it hasn't the understanding, it hasn't awakened to these things.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.760]   If regeneration follows belief and acceptance and listening to the Word, there is no hope
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.400]   for any infant.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.480]   But we don't believe that.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.680]   We obviously reject such a suggestion.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.040]   And the answer is, of course, that a child is regenerated in exactly the same way as
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.320]   anybody else.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:56.640]   Because it is the action of this Almighty Being, of God himself, through the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:05.560]   He can implant this seed of spiritual life in an unconscious infant with the same ease
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.400]   as he can do it in an adult person.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.080]   And therefore it is important for us, you see, to consider whether regeneration is something
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.720]   that happens immediately or indirectly through the Word, or whether it is indeed the direct
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.240]   operation of God upon us.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:32.920]   And I am teaching again, as I did last week, that it is immediate, direct, it is God creating
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   a new as he created out of nothing at the beginning.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.400]   And finally for this evening, the last thing I would say is that obviously in the light
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.560]   of all this, it is something that can never be lost.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.520]   If you are regenerate, you are regenerate.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.640]   And you will remain regenerate.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.560]   It seems to me that this is absolutely inevitable because it is the work of God.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.600]   And yet there are people who seem to think that a man can be born again as a result of
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.240]   believing the truth, and then if he backslides or falls into sin or denies the truth, he
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.680]   has lost his regeneration.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.720]   And then he comes back again and he believes again, he is regenerate again, as if a man
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.240]   can be born again and dead and born again and dead almost an endless number of times.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.440]   My friends, how important doctrine is.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.920]   How important it is we should be clear as to what the Scripture teaches about these
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.160]   things.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   We are told that this is the work of God himself in the depths of the soul, and he does it
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.800]   in such a way that it is permanent.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.920]   No man shall pluck them out of my hand.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.400]   I am persuaded, says Paul, and let us listen to him, I am persuaded, he is certain, that
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:01.320]   neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:08.120]   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.080]   the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.280]   And when he says that he is expounding regeneration, it is not merely the relationship between
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.040]   us, it is because God has put this life in me that nothing can separate me from him.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.960]   And when we come to deal with the mystical union which follows directly from this, and
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.840]   which I hope to consider with you next Friday, we shall see, of course, how still more inevitable
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.240]   this must be.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:43.800]   Now, now, this is a permanent work and nothing can ever bring it to an end.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.200]   And take those verses that we read just now from the first epistle of John, "Whosoever
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:55.040]   is born of God does not commit sin," which means he does not go on abiding in sin.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   Why?
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.480]   Well, "for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God."
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   He cannot go on sinning because he is born of God.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   Now, let's be clear about that.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:17.760]   The man who is born of God, who is regenerate, simply does not and cannot continue to abide
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.160]   in a life of sin.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.320]   He may backslide temporarily, but if he is born of God, he will come back.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.680]   It is as certain as he has been born again.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.280]   It is the way to test whether a man is born again or not.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.920]   Or take that other word in 1 John 2, 19.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.200]   They went out from us, but they were not of us.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:47.060]   But they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.560]   They were members of the church, these people.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.320]   They appeared to be Christians.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.240]   They said the right things.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.420]   And up to a point, their life seemed to be right.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.420]   But they went out.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.480]   Why did they go out?
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.600]   They went out because they were not of us, they were not regenerate.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.880]   They have never been born again.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.240]   That's why they've gone out in a sense, as John to give proof of the fact that they've
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.720]   never really had life.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.840]   But what about sixth of Hebrews and tenth of Hebrews, says someone?
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:22.320]   Yes, the answer is that there is nothing in either the sixth or the tenth of Hebrews to
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   suggest that those people were ever regenerate.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.280]   They'd had marvelous experiences.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.560]   There is nothing to say that they were born again.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.020]   They were not born again.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.680]   And that is the explanation of it.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.200]   The regenerate abide.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.080]   They may backslide, they may fall into sin, they may fail.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.960]   They abide because the life is there.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.880]   The others may appear to be fully Christian, but if there isn't life, they won't abide.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.020]   Life shows itself.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.480]   And it gives truth of its existence.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   Well, God willing, we may start with the proofs of regeneration next time, and as I've said,
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   go on then to consider the biblical teaching about this mystical union between the believer
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:17.640]   and Christ, which must always be taken in connection with the doctrine of regeneration.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.400]   Let us pray.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:29.240]   Our heavenly Father, we turn unto thee, and we desire to thank thee for this precious,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.280]   wondrous, glorious truth that we've been looking at together.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.720]   O God, we thank thee for it.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.760]   We thank thee for the peace it gives us.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.840]   We thank thee for the safety it gives us.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.960]   We thank thee for the security it provides for us.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   O God, we thank thee that it is because we are thy workmanship that we are what we are.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:04.440]   O, we beseech thee, enable us to understand this precious truth more and more, and may
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:12.280]   the evidence of its truth in us be more and more manifest.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:22.400]   O God, accept our humble and unworthy praise, and continue by thy grace and by the unction
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.960]   of the Spirit to lead us into an ever deeper understanding.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:36.720]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now and evermore.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   Amen.
