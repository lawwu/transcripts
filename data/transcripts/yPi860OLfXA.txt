[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Hi Cal, my name is Vinny
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.720]   and I'm a freelance software developer,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.240]   but this question isn't about me.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm trying to help my girlfriend,
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.160]   a high level photo producer,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.200]   avoid ad hoc unstructured back and forth messages,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.480]   but constantly putting out fires
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.960]   and acquiescing to last minute ultra short deadlines
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.760]   that necessitate promptly responding
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.000]   to collaborators questions and feedback
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.280]   seems to be the entirety of her role
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.840]   and the value that she brings to her clients projects.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   I suppose more generally, my question is,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.720]   when an entire industry and your competition within it
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   seem to be fully content with losing their sanity
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.840]   to the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   and this precise trait gives them a competitive edge,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.680]   how can we compete?
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.800]   It often feels like it's better to give in for a few years
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.080]   and enjoy the high salaries,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440]   retire early and then get into a deep life,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   but years have a way of turning into decades
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.800]   and decades into death.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.720]   All right, thanks.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.920]   - Well, we have a lot to cover here.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.760]   I mean, first of all,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.480]   there's the inherent danger of this situation.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   So you're looking for advice now to give to your girlfriend
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.880]   and I can tell you there's nothing that girlfriends
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.680]   like more than having their boyfriends explain to them
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.040]   how they should live their life
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.960]   and how their work should actually be executed.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   So we're already in trouble here.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.720]   So good luck.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.480]   But let's look at this more abstractly.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.360]   Let's look at this more abstractly.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.480]   Jobs that seem to be inherently hyperactive,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.760]   what should you do?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.640]   And it looks like what you're asking is,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.240]   can it be improved?
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.080]   And if not, should it be suffered through temporarily?
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120]   And then maybe you build up a lot of money, retire early,
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.200]   or should you switch?
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   I think these are good questions.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.160]   Because all the answers are on the table.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.760]   Let's start with this particular job
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.120]   that your girlfriend has.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.600]   And push on the issue of whether
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   it can be made less hyperactive.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.160]   And if we decide in the end it can't,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   then we'll look at these other two options.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.760]   All right, there are a lot of positions
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.440]   that seem fundamentally hyperactive
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.400]   that you can actually do a lot of work to pull that back.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.880]   So when you're in a situation where it seems like
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.240]   hyperactive communication is necessary,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.080]   often what that means is,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   given the existing agreements and structures
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   for interaction that are in place,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.440]   there's no way to do this work without just being on demand
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.080]   and being able to answer things all the time.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.200]   That's often what that means.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.080]   Because often the exercise someone will do
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600]   is they will say, well, what would happen
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.480]   if I just stopped tomorrow
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.240]   checking my email all the time?
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.800]   What if I didn't look at my phone all the time?
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.920]   And they say, oh, it'd be a disaster
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.680]   because this is when things come in and they're urgent
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.520]   and things would get missed.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.340]   And that's true.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.800]   But the question is not what would happen
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.120]   if I stopped tomorrow checking email or checking my phone.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.560]   The question is, is there work I could do right now
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.320]   that would make it possible a month from now
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.020]   not to be checking my email or phone so much?
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.600]   That is, if we change the fundamental agreement
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.860]   and structures for how interaction actually happened.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.000]   There's probably a lot more leeway here
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.320]   than you might expect.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   The big principle I always come back to
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.720]   is that when it comes to external communication,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.380]   clarity trumps accessibility.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.000]   Almost always true.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Why do people want an immediate response for something?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.420]   Because in the lack of other clarity
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.060]   about how interaction on this subject occurs,
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.460]   there's no clarity on that.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.200]   When I send a message to you, I am stressed out right away.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.340]   This is important.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.600]   I need it dealt with.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.280]   There's nothing I can count on here
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.760]   about here's how these sort of situations
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.600]   always get dealt with.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.700]   And so until you answer me,
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.000]   I have to keep this on my mind as a source of stress.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.720]   In that environment,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.680]   yes, I'm gonna want you to answer right away
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.560]   because every minute you don't answer
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.320]   is a minute that I have to keep track of this thing
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.500]   and be stressed about whether it's gonna be answered or not.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.700]   Almost always when you see these cases of people saying,
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.540]   emailing two minutes after the first email,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.380]   did you get the first email?
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.040]   What's going on?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.200]   It's not because they have some sort of dictatorial
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.560]   obsession about communication.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   It's because every minute that you don't answer
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   is one that they're stressed out
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.280]   and trying to keep track of this.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.200]   So if you can have more clarity,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.280]   this is how we deal with X.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.400]   This is how we deal with Y.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.800]   This is how we deal with Z.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.960]   Clarity that takes that stress away from the client.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.360]   Okay, I know how this is gonna handle.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.480]   I can get off my mind.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   You're often gonna be okay with that.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.440]   Even if the way it's handled is not,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.100]   I will just get back to you within one minute.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.480]   Now, I can't give you the specific solutions
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.560]   for your girlfriend's situation
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.520]   because I don't know that industry well.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.480]   But I can talk about the type of things I've seen
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.280]   in other classically hyperactive,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.480]   communicative segments of the economy
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.540]   where we've seen escape from hyperactivity.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.780]   So having something like,
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.660]   here are the set times we talk every week.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.500]   We can get through everything that's going on
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.900]   and I'll give you a written copy
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.060]   of everything we discussed and all the commitments
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.540]   so we can get that right back to you.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.020]   That often makes a big difference.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.740]   Office hours make a big difference.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.300]   If there's a set time that you can get me
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.900]   every afternoon or every morning and I will be there,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.540]   you'll just get me and you can look me in the eye
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.820]   over Zoom or get me on the phone
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.340]   and we handle what has to happen.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.860]   That works pretty well.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.420]   Having an assistant of some type that intakes
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.740]   all of the intaking crisis communication.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.900]   And you have a morning and afternoon sit down
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.460]   with that assistant and the client knows this.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.340]   The client is like, "Oh my God, there's this issue here."
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.100]   And the assistant's like, "I've got it, I've logged it.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.100]   And Susan will be looking at this afternoon."
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.900]   One way or the other, you will hear back from us
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.260]   at the end of that afternoon
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.580]   or the end of the morning session if it comes in overnight.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.980]   Clarity, I've sent this thing, I got a response.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.040]   I know one day I'm gonna hear a more detailed response.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.300]   I trust it.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.300]   I can get it off my head.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.740]   I'm not gonna be so stressed out about it.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.860]   Depending on the type of work,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.620]   more involved client extranets can work as well.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.220]   You have a whole system.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.900]   Here's the status of the project.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.940]   Here's where the next meeting is.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.060]   Here's all the documents.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.380]   Here's the blog about what we're working on, the work logs.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.420]   You can see what's going on.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.100]   Here is where you register your questions and concerns
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.060]   and we can see them right here.
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.100]   And the answers come in here
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.900]   and you get those answers once a day.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.340]   That makes a big difference.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.600]   Having different tools for information
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.120]   to be injected into the project
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   beyond just let me put it in an email
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.360]   and hope it gets tracked.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.480]   Some sort of collaborative project management software,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.680]   that can make a big difference.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.080]   All these things can make a big difference.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   Now let's say you've done all of that
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   but there's these two clients that say, I don't care.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.960]   I just want you to answer my email because that's my thing.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   Well, then you have the option of firing those clients.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.920]   Because this is also something that comes up often
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.460]   in these situations that the malformed social instinct
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.420]   that says you have to answer me is not evenly distributed.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.680]   And the people who have that instinct,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.020]   you don't care about clarity.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.340]   They like the power, don't work with them.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.580]   Right?
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.460]   Yeah, less money, but you're going to do much better
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.700]   with the other clients are going to be happier.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.820]   So I think all those things are on the table.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.180]   Clarity over accessibility, clarity over accessibility,
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.340]   firing the small number of people
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.020]   who won't put up with that.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.860]   That might get you there.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.720]   If that doesn't get you there,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.120]   if it's fundamental for this work,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.900]   now it's just the way her firm runs.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.320]   They're not going to change.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.180]   That's just what it is.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.180]   I would counsel against the, I will retire soon or early.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.260]   Let me put up with it to make the high salary.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.940]   Not worth it.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.780]   Not worth it.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.260]   Take your career capital, go somewhere else
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.860]   where you can set up a day-to-day professional life
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.620]   that is sustainable.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.000]   I would do that tomorrow.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.540]   I would do that tomorrow.
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.060]   You're not going to build up enough money
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.100]   to retire in three years.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.060]   That's hard to do.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.540]   You're going to spend more of it than you think.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.280]   And you're going to land the autonomy trap.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.860]   You're going to land in the classic autonomy trap
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.220]   of you're going to get higher and higher salary,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.060]   get better and better.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.360]   It's very difficult to leave.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   I'm usually very much against
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.100]   almost any professional circumstance
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.740]   where it is unsustainable
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.940]   and pulling down on your mental health.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.820]   Almost always that is not the right place to be
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.840]   unless it really is time limited and serving a broader goal.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.680]   If you're a Navy SEAL in buds during hell week,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.720]   yeah, that's psychologically bad,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.000]   but it's serving a larger goal
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and it will be over after a few days
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.200]   and then you'll have the pool torture
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   and some other stuff going on,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.000]   but then it will be done.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.840]   Okay, I get that.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.560]   But if it's just, this is how we do business,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.160]   get out sooner rather than later.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.180]   You know, life is too short, but also life is too cool.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.680]   There's too much potential for interestingness and depth
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.400]   and everything else that could be going on in your life.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   With all of that potential out there,
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.280]   do you really want to have the dominant thing in your life
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.200]   being a day-to-day experience that is stressful and dragging?
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.000]   So if you cannot engineer the hyperactivity
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.680]   out of the position, change that position.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.480]   And again, I'm sure your girlfriend's going to appreciate
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.960]   you figuring this all out for her
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.920]   and telling her what she should do for her job.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.840]   And so let me just, I'll speak directly to your girlfriend.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.380]   My apologies in advance for the mansplaining
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.280]   that's coming your way,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.040]   but it's a good question in the abstract.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.720]   And I think that's the way I think about it.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.940]   [Music]
