[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   We've got to have strategic empathy about Putin as well.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.720]   We've got to understand how the guy thinks
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.560]   and why he thinks like he does.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.640]   He has got his own context and his own frame
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.520]   and his own rationale.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.480]   And he is rational.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.280]   He is a rational actor in his own context.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.120]   We've got to understand that.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.000]   We've got to understand that he would take offense
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   at something and he would take action over something.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.500]   It doesn't mean to say that we are necessary to blame
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.160]   by taking actions, but we are to blame
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.120]   when we don't understand the consequences
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.160]   of things that we do and act accordingly
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   or take preventative action or recognize
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520]   that something might happen as a result of something.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.800]   - What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680]   with a tactical nuclear weapon?
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.600]   The following is a conversation with Fiona Hill,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.280]   a presidential advisor and foreign policy expert
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.140]   specializing in Russia.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.760]   She has served the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.200]   including being a top advisor on Russia to Donald Trump.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.000]   She has made it to the White House from Humble Beginnings
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.400]   in the North of England, a story she tells in her book,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600]   "There's Nothing for You Here."
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   in the description.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.900]   And now, dear friends, here's Fiona Hill.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.240]   You came from Humble Beginning in a coal mining town
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.580]   in Northeast England.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.040]   So what were some formative moments in your young life
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.440]   that made you the woman you are today?
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.160]   - I was born in 1965 and it was the period
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.680]   where the whole coal sector in Britain
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   was in decline already.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   And basically, my father, by the time I came along,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.360]   had lost his job multiple times.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.760]   Every coal mine he worked in was closing down.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.800]   He was looking constantly for other work
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.880]   and he had no qualifications because at age 14,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.460]   he'd gone down the mines.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.320]   His father had gone down the mines at 13.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.780]   His great-grandfather around the same kind of age.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.260]   I mean, you had a lot of people at different points
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.280]   going down coal mines at 12, 13, 14.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   They didn't get educated beyond that period
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.920]   because the expectation was,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080]   "Hey, you're gonna go down the mine
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.520]   like everybody else in your family."
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560]   And then he didn't really have any other qualifications
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.800]   to basically find another job
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.320]   beyond something in manual labor.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.400]   So he worked in a steelworks.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   That didn't work out.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.000]   A brickworks, that closed down.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.200]   And then he went to work in the local hospital,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.220]   part of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.560]   as a porter, an orderly.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   So basically, somebody's just pushing people around.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.460]   There was no opportunity to retrain.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.040]   So the big issue in my family was education.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.280]   You've gotta have one.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   You've gotta have some qualifications.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.400]   The world is changing.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.040]   It's changing really quickly.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.400]   And for you to kind of keep up with it,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.680]   you're gonna have to get educated
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280]   and find a way out of this.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.180]   And very early on, my father had basically said to me,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.920]   "There's nothing for you here.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.800]   You're gonna have to, if you want to get ahead."
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   And he didn't have any kind of idea
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   that as a girl, I wouldn't.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.560]   I mean, actually, in many respects,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.080]   I think I benefited from being a girl rather than a boy.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.400]   There was no expectation that I would go into industry.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   There was some kind of idea that maybe
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.400]   if I got qualifications, I could be a nurse.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.880]   My mother was a midwife.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080]   And so she'd, at age 16, left school
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.680]   and gone to train as a nurse and then as a midwife.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.780]   I had other relatives who'd gone to teach in local schools.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.700]   And so there was an idea that women could get educated
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.460]   and there was a kind of a range of things that you could do.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.920]   But the expectation then was,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.800]   go out there, do something with your life,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.940]   but also a sense that you'd probably have to leave.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.300]   So all of that was circling around me,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.060]   particularly in my teenage years,
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.380]   as I was trying to find my way through life
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.780]   and looking forward.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.560]   - First of all, what does that even look like,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.520]   getting educated, given the context of that place?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   You don't know.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.480]   There's a whole world of mystery out there.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.960]   So how do you figure out what to actually do out there?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.040]   But was there moments, formative moments,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.740]   either challenging or just inspiring,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.400]   where you wondered about what you want to be,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.360]   where you want to go?
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.800]   - Yeah, there were a number of things.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.320]   I mean, I think like a lot of kids,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.920]   you talk to people,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.680]   and particularly from blue collar backgrounds,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   said, "What did you want to do?"
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.900]   Boys might say, "I wanted to be a fireman."
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.940]   Or you got kind of...
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.300]   At one point, when I was a little girl,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.220]   I wanted to be a nurse.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.180]   I had a little nurse's uniform like my mother.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.380]   I didn't really know what that meant,
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.940]   but I used to go around pretending to be a nurse.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.500]   I even had a little magazine called Nurse Nancy,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.180]   and I used to read this.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   And that was one of the formative ideas.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.540]   We also, it was a rural area, semi-rural area,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.020]   and I'd be out in the fields all the time,
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.620]   and I'd watch farmers with their animals,
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.060]   and I'd see vets coming along
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.060]   and watching people deal with the livestock.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.420]   And there was a kind of a famous story at the time
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.980]   about a vet called James Herriot.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.940]   It became here in the United States as well,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.460]   and was a sort of a TV miniseries.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.780]   He'd written a book, and he was the vet
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.060]   for one of my great aunt's dogs.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.380]   And people were always talking about him,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.940]   and I thought, "Oh, I could be a vet."
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.820]   And then one day I saw one of the local vets
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.780]   with his hand up the backside of a cow in a field,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.580]   and he'd got his hand stuck, and the cow was kicking him.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.260]   And I thought, "Yeah, maybe not, actually.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.780]   No, I don't think I want to be a vet."
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.500]   So I cycled through all of these things about,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.860]   okay, I could get an education,
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.540]   but the whole sense was you had to apply your education.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.820]   It wasn't an education for education's sake.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.060]   It was an education to do something.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.060]   And when I was about 14 or 15,
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.060]   my local member of parliament came to the school,
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.900]   and it was one of these pep talks
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.340]   for kids in these deprived areas.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.980]   He had been quite prominent in local education,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.340]   and now he was a member of parliament.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.140]   He himself had come from a really hard-scrabble background,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.780]   and had risen up through education.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.820]   He'd even gone to Oxford
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.620]   and done philosophy, politics, and economics.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.780]   And he basically told my class,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.220]   even though it was highly unlikely
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.940]   any of us were really going to get ahead
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.580]   and go to elite institutions,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.940]   "Look, you can get an education.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.620]   You don't have to be held back by your circumstances.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.620]   But if you do get an education, it's a privilege,
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.820]   and you need to do something with it."
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.700]   So then I'm thinking, "Well, what could I do?"
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.580]   Okay, an education's a qualification.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.700]   It's to do something.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.660]   Most people around me I knew didn't have careers.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.900]   I mean, my dad didn't really have a career.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.060]   He had jobs.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.940]   My mom thought of her nursing as a career, though,
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.020]   and it genuinely was,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.780]   and she was out there trying to help women
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.260]   survive childbirth.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.020]   My mother had these horrific stories,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.620]   basically over the dining room table,
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.860]   that she'd stop, she'd leave out her nursing books.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.860]   And I tell you, if everyone had had my mom as a mother,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.380]   there'd be no reproduction on the planet.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.300]   It was just these grim, horrific stories
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.700]   of breached births and fistulas and all kinds of horrors
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.980]   that my sister and I would just go,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.660]   "Oh my God, you know, what?
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.140]   Please stop."
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.420]   So I thought, "Well, you know,
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.180]   I don't necessarily want to go in that direction."
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.340]   But it was the timing that really cinched things for me.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.500]   I was very lucky that the region that I grew up,
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.220]   County Durham, despite the massive decline,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.580]   deindustrialization, and the complete collapse
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.020]   of the local government system around me,
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.420]   still maintained money for education.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.180]   And they also paid for exchanges.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.060]   And we had exchange programs with cities in Germany,
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.700]   in France, also in Russia, in Kostroma, near Yaroslavl,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.220]   for example, an old textile town,
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.660]   similar down in its kind of region,
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.700]   but quite historic in the Russian context.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.300]   In fact, the original birthplace
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.540]   of the Romanov dynasty in Kostroma,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.020]   just as County Durham was quite a distinguished,
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.500]   historic area in the British context.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.460]   And so it was an idea that I could go on exchanges,
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.620]   I could learn languages.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.460]   I studied German, I studied French.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.620]   And then in 1983, there was the war scare,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.420]   basically provoked by the Euro Missile Crisis.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.300]   So the stationing of new categories
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.740]   of strategic nuclear weapons
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.300]   and intermediate nuclear weapons in Western Europe
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.820]   and in Eastern Europe during the height of the Cold War.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.940]   And this Euro Missile Crisis over SS-20
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.060]   and Pershing missiles went on from 1977,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.060]   so when I was about 11 or 12,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.220]   all the way through into the later part of the 1980s.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.220]   And in 1983, we came extraordinarily close
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.140]   to a nuclear conflict.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.780]   It was very much another rerun
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.220]   of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.740]   So 20 years on, same kind of thing.
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.020]   The Soviets misread,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.180]   although I didn't know this at the time,
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.300]   I know a lot of this after the fact,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.140]   but the tension was palpable.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.940]   But what happened was the Soviets misread the intentions
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.500]   of a series of exercises, Operation Able Archer,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.220]   that the United States was conducting
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.820]   and actually thought that the United States
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.300]   might be preparing for a first nuclear strike.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.140]   And that then set up a whole set
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.500]   of literal chain reactions in the Soviet Union.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.100]   Eventually, it was recognized that all of this
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.980]   was really based on misperceptions.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.500]   And of course, that later led to negotiations
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.780]   between Gorbachev and Reagan
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.580]   for the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, the INF Treaty.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.940]   But in 1983, that tension was just acute.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.460]   And for us as a teenager,
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.860]   we were basically being prepped the whole time
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.260]   for the inevitability of nuclear Armageddon.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.740]   There were TV series, films in the United States
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.780]   and the UK, threads the day after.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.420]   We had all these public service announcements
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.980]   telling us to seek sanctuary or cover
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.700]   in the inevitability of a nuclear blast.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.380]   And my house was so small,
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.620]   they said, "Look for a room without a window."
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.980]   There were no rooms without windows.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.140]   My dad put on these really thick curtains over the window
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.220]   and said if there was a nuclear flash,
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.700]   we'd have to get down on the floor, not look up,
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.700]   but the curtains would help.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.380]   And we were like, "This is ridiculous, Dad."
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.180]   And we would all try to see if we could squeeze
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.020]   in the space under the stairs,
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.980]   a cupboard under the stairs like Harry Potter.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.940]   I mean, it's all just totally nuts.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.500]   Or you had to throw yourself in a ditch if you were outside.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.340]   And I thought, "Well, this isn't gonna work."
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.900]   And one of my great uncles who had fought in World War II
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.980]   said, "Well, look, you're good at languages, Fiona.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.340]   Why don't you go and study Russian?
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.300]   Try to figure it out.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.820]   Figure out why the Russians are trying to blow us up."
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.300]   Because during the- - Go talk to them.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.500]   - Exactly, during World War II,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.820]   the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.940]   had all been wartime allies.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.540]   And my uncle Charlie thought,
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.100]   "Well, there's something gone wrong here.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.380]   Maybe you can figure it out."
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   And as you said, "Go talk to them."
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.620]   So I thought, "Okay, I'll study Russian."
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.740]   So that's really how this came about.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.820]   I thought, "Well, it's applying education.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.500]   I'll just do my very best to understand
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.060]   everything I possibly can about the Russian language
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.540]   and the Soviet Union, and I'll see what I can do."
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.660]   And I thought, "Well, maybe I could become a translator."
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.820]   So I had visions of myself sitting around,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.620]   you know, listening to things in a big headset
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.260]   and in a best way translating perhaps
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.700]   at some future arms control summits.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.700]   - So how did the journey continue with learning Russian?
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:54.380]   I mean, this early dream of being a translator
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.100]   and thinking, "How can I actually help understand
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.740]   or maybe help even deeper way with this conflict
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.340]   that threatens the existence of the human species?"
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.540]   How did it actually continue?
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.700]   - Well, I mean, I read everything I possibly could
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.740]   about nuclear weapons and nuclear war,
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.260]   and I started to try to teach myself Russian a little bit.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.340]   - So it was always in context of nuclear war?
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.180]   - It was very much in the context of nuclear war
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.220]   at this particular point, but also in historical context,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.780]   because I knew that the United States
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.900]   and the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.300]   had been wartime allies in World War II,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   so I tried to understand all of that.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.540]   And also, you know, like many other people,
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.140]   I'd read Russian literature in translation.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.940]   I'd read "War and Peace," and I loved the book, actually.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.300]   I mean, particularly the story parts of it.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.460]   I wasn't one really at that time when I was a teenager.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.340]   I thought Tolstoy went on a bit, you know,
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.580]   in terms of his series of "The Great Man"
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.140]   and of history and, you know, kind of social change,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.380]   although now I appreciate it more.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.940]   But when I was about 14, I was like,
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.740]   "This man needed an editor.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.020]   Could he have just gone on with the story?
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.940]   What an amazing story, what an incredible,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.260]   you know, kind of book this is."
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.580]   - I still think he needs an editor, but...
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.980]   - Well, I think his wife tried, didn't she?
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.620]   But he got quite upset with her.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.700]   And then I kind of thought to myself,
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.500]   "Well, how do I study Russian?"
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.540]   Because there were very few schools in my region,
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.980]   you know, given the impoverishment of the region
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.020]   where you could study Russian,
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.060]   so I would have to take Russian from scratch.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.860]   And this is where things get really quite interesting,
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.460]   because there were opportunities
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.940]   to study Russian at universities,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.740]   but I would need to have, first of all,
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.460]   an intensive Russian language course in the summer,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.700]   and I didn't have the money for that.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.500]   And the period is around the miners' strike
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.780]   in the United Kingdom in 1984.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.660]   Now, the miners of County Durham
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.700]   had very interestingly had exchanges and ties
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.140]   with the miners of Donbass going back to the 1920s.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.620]   And as I studied Russian history,
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.740]   I discovered there was lots of contacts
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.540]   between Bolshevik, Soviet Union,
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.180]   the early period after the Russian Revolution,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.620]   but even before that,
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.180]   during the imperial period in Russia
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.260]   between the Northern England and the Russian Empire
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.940]   and the old industrial areas.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.420]   Basically, big industrial areas
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.260]   like the Northeast of England and places like Donbass
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.380]   were built up at the same time,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.380]   often by the same sets of industrialists.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.500]   And Donetsk in the Donbass region
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.460]   used to be called Husevka,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.820]   because it was established by a Welsh industrialist
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.020]   who brought in miners from Wales
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.740]   to help kind of develop the coal mines there,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.660]   and also the steelworks and others
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.300]   that we're hearing about all the time.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.260]   So I got very fascinated in all these linkages.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.420]   And famous writers from the early parts of the Soviet Union
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.420]   like Yevgeny Zamyatin worked in the shipyards
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.060]   in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.060]   and there was just this whole set of connections.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.060]   And in 1984, when the miners' strike took place,
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.420]   the miners of Donbass, along with other miners
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.740]   from famous coal regions like the Ruhr Valley,
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.780]   for example, in Germany, or miners in Poland,
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.860]   sent money in solidarity to the miners of Kandy-Durham.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.180]   And there'd been these exchanges, as I said,
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.460]   going back and forth since the 1920s,
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.660]   formal exchanges between miners,
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.100]   the regional miners' unions.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.980]   And I heard, again, from the same great-uncle
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.580]   who had told me to study Russian,
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.900]   that there were actually scholarships
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.020]   for the children of miners,
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.500]   and it could be former miners as well, for their education.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.580]   And I should go along to the miners' hall,
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.420]   a place called Red Hills,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.100]   where the miners of Kandy-Durham
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.260]   had actually pooled all of their resources
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.020]   and built up their own parliament,
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.420]   and their own place that they could talk among themselves
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.140]   to figure out how to enhance the welfare
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.220]   and wellbeing of their communities.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.500]   And they'd put money aside for education for miners.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.540]   There was all kinds of lecture series from the miners
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.820]   and all kinds of other activities supporting soccer teams
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.380]   and artistic circles and writing circles, for example.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.460]   People like George Orwell were involved
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.140]   in some of these writers' circles
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.100]   in other parts of Britain and mining communities, for example.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.380]   And so they told me I could go along
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.660]   and basically apply for a grant to go to study Russian.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.980]   So I show up, and it was the easiest application
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.820]   I've ever come across.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.700]   They just asked me to, my dad came along with me.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.300]   They asked me to verify that my dad had been a miner,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.100]   and they looked up his employment record on little cards,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.780]   you know, kind of a little tray somewhere.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.140]   And then they asked me how much I needed
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.420]   to basically pay for the travel
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.740]   and some of the basic expenses for the study,
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.300]   and they wrote me a cheque.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.820]   And so thanks to the miners of Donbass
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.460]   and this money that was deposited
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.220]   with the miners of Kandy-Durham
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.980]   with the Durham Miners' Association,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.620]   I got the money to study Russian for the first time
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.780]   before I embarked on my studies at university.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.100]   - As you're speaking now, it's reminding me
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.100]   that there's a different way to look
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.380]   both at history and at geography and at different places.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.860]   You know, this is an industrial region.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.180]   - That's right. - And it echoes,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.180]   and the experience of living there is more captured
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.420]   not by Moscow or Kiev, but by, at least historically,
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.900]   but by just being a mining town and industrial town.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.700]   - That's right, in the place itself.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.820]   there are places in the United States,
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.340]   in Appalachia, in West Virginia, and in Pennsylvania,
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.860]   like the Lehigh Valley, that have the same sense of place.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.540]   And the northeast of England, you know,
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.420]   was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.380]   It was the industrial version of Silicon Valley,
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.860]   which has its own, I would say, contours and frames.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.420]   And when you come to those industrial areas,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.700]   your previous identities get submerged
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   in that larger framework.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.460]   I've always looked at the world through that lens
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.900]   of being, you know, someone from the working class,
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.780]   the blue-collar communities, from a very specific place
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.940]   with lots of historical and economic connotations.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.340]   And it's also a melting pot, which is the problems
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.540]   that the Donbassers experienced over the last 30 years.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.300]   That people came from all over the place to work there.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.980]   Of course, it was a population
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.500]   that one might say is indigenous, you know,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.220]   might've gone back centuries there,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.380]   but they would have been, you know,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.300]   in the smaller rural farming communities,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.100]   just like it was the same in the northeast of England.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.700]   And people, in the case of the northeast of England,
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.340]   came from Wales, they came from further
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.780]   in the south of England, the Midlands,
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.740]   they came from Scotland, they came from Ireland.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.900]   I have all of that heritage in my own personal background.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.540]   And you've got a different identity.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.740]   And it's when somebody else tries to impose an identity
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.020]   on you from the outside that things go awry.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.420]   And I think that that's kind of what we've really seen
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.340]   in the case of Donbass.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.340]   It's a place that's a part in many respects,
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.340]   historically, and in terms of its evolution
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.060]   and development over time.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.180]   And, you know, particularly in the case of Russia,
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.020]   the Russians have tried to say, "Well, look," you know,
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.340]   because most people speak Russian there,
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.580]   is the lingua franca.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.700]   I mean, in the northeast of England,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.700]   of course, everyone spoke English,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.740]   but lots of people were Irish speakers,
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.900]   you know, Gaelic-Irish speakers,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.180]   or, you know, some of them might have
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.340]   certainly been Welsh speakers.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.260]   There was lots of Welsh miners who spoke Welsh
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.980]   as their first language who came there,
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.260]   you know, but they created an identity.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.420]   It's the same in Belfast, in Ulster,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.660]   you know, the northern province of the, you know,
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.740]   the whole of the Irish island,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.540]   you know, the part of Ireland
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.460]   that is still part of the United Kingdom.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.820]   That was also a heavily industrialized area,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.460]   high manufacturing, mass manufacturing,
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.700]   shipbuilding, for example.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.620]   People came from all over there, too,
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.940]   which is why when Ireland got its independence
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.260]   in the United Kingdom, Ulster, Belfast,
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.780]   and that whole region, you know, kind of clung on
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.740]   because it was, again, that melting pot.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.660]   It was kind of intertwined with the larger
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.340]   industrial economy and had a very different identity.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.820]   And so that, you know, for me,
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.220]   growing up in such a specific place
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:05.220]   with such a special, in many respects, heritage
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.940]   gave me a different perspective on things.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.260]   When I first went to the Soviet Union in 1987
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.780]   to study there, I actually went to a translators' institute,
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.340]   what was then called the Maurice Therese,
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.980]   which is now the Institute of Foreign Languages.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.940]   I was immediately struck by how similar
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.180]   everything was to the north of England
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.460]   because it was just like one big working-class culture
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.900]   that had sort of broken out onto the national stage.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.860]   Everything in northern England was nationalized.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.620]   We had British steel, British coal,
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.500]   British rail, British shipbuilding,
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.660]   because after World War II,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.900]   the private sector had been devastated
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.860]   and the state had to step in.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.780]   And of course, the Soviet Union is one great big,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.740]   giant, nationalized economy when I get there.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   And it's just, the people's attitudes
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.580]   and outlooks are the same.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.900]   People didn't work for themselves.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.860]   They always worked for somebody else.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.660]   And it had quite a distortion on the way
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.980]   that people looked at the world.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.300]   - Do you still speak Russian?
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.140]   - I do, yeah.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.980]   - You speak Russian?
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.100]   - Yeah, I can, of course, if you want.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.100]   - Well, then I need to say something
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.260]   and everyone will think about what we're talking about.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.140]   - Yeah, it would be a big mystery for everybody.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.140]   You have an advantage on me
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.420]   because it's your native language as well.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.460]   - For people wondering, the English speakers in the audience,
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.620]   you're really missing a lot
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.620]   from the few sentences we said there.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.900]   Yeah, it's a fascinating language
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.060]   that stretches actually geographically
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.300]   across a very large part of this world.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.900]   So there you are in 1987,
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.100]   an exchange student in the Soviet Union.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.260]   What was that world like?
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.700]   - Well, that was absolutely fascinating in that period
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.340]   because it's the period that's just around the time
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.860]   of the peak of Perestroika,
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.340]   Mikhail Gorbachev's role as president.
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.660]   Well, he wasn't quite president at that point.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.380]   He was Secretary General of the Communist Party
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   of the Soviet Union,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.180]   trying to transform the whole place.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.700]   So I arrived there in September of 1987,
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.700]   just as Gorbachev and Reagan sign the INF Treaty.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.660]   It was just within weeks of them about to sign that,
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.420]   which really ends that whole period
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   that had shaped my entire teenage years
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.260]   of the end of the Euromissile Crisis
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.860]   by finally having agreement on basically the reduction
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.020]   and constraints on intermediate nuclear forces.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.380]   And also at this point,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.980]   Gorbachev is opening the Soviet Union up.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.180]   So we got all kinds of opportunities to travel
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.620]   in ways that we wouldn't have done before.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.100]   Not just in Moscow,
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.940]   which is where I was studying at the translational institute,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.020]   but to the Caucasus, to Central Asia,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.940]   went all the way to Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East,
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.100]   all the way around Moscow.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.660]   And at this point, it was also the Kreseniya Rus',
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.060]   which has become very important now.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.500]   This was the anniversary,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.500]   the thousandth anniversary of the Christianization of Russia,
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.580]   which of course has become a massive obsession
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.980]   of Vladimir Putin's, but you know, 988,
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.220]   'cause I was there '87 to '88.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.380]   At this point, the Russian Orthodox Church
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.620]   is undergoing a revival
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.980]   from being repressed during the Soviet period.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.180]   You certainly have the church stepping out
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.260]   as a non-governmental organization
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.420]   and engaging in discussions with people
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.860]   about the future of religion.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.820]   So that was something that I wasn't expecting to witness.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.180]   Also, I mean, being in Moscow,
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.780]   this is the cultural capital of a vast empire at this point.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.340]   I'd never lived in a major city before.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.180]   It's the first big city I lived in.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.580]   I'd never been to the opera.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.300]   You know, the first time I got an opera,
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.740]   it's at the Bolshoi, and I'd never seen a ballet.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.100]   I mean, I was not exactly steeped in high classical culture.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.900]   When you're kind of growing up in a mining region,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.900]   you know, there's very limited opportunities
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.740]   for this kind of thing.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.820]   I'd been in a youth orchestra and a youth choir.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.300]   My parents signed me up for absolutely everything,
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.460]   you know, they possibly could education-wise,
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.740]   but it wasn't exactly any exposure to this.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.620]   So, you know, I was kind of astounded
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.540]   by the sort of wealth of the cultural experience
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.420]   that one could have in Moscow.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.460]   But the main thing was I was really struck
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.660]   by how the Soviet Union was on its last legs.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.260]   Because this was Moscow, you know,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.500]   I got this image about what it would look like.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.220]   I was quite, to be honest, terrified at first
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   about what I would see there,
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.980]   if not the big nuclear superpower.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.300]   And as soon as I got there,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.060]   it was just this like as if a huge weight
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.700]   that I'd been carrying around for years
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.100]   in my teenage years just disappeared
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.260]   because it's just ordinary people
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.740]   in an ordinary place, not doing great.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.060]   This is the period of, you know,
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.860]   what they call "deficitnei vremye,"
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.420]   you know, so the period of deficits.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.100]   But there was no food in the shops.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.500]   There was, you know, very little in terms of commodities
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.180]   because the supply and demand parts
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.780]   of the economic equation were out of whack
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.460]   because this was total central planning.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.100]   You know, you'd go into, you know,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.940]   a shop that was supposed to sell boots
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.700]   and there'd be just one pair of boots
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.020]   all in the same size and the same color.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.820]   I actually lucked out because once I was
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.300]   in this Hungarian boot shop that was right next
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.340]   to where my hall of residence was
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.580]   and I was looking for a new pair of boots
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.460]   and every single pair of boots in the shop were my size.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.300]   And they were all women's boots.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.140]   There were no men's boots at all, you know,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.940]   'cause there was been an oversupply of boots
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.540]   and that size production.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.820]   But you could really kind of see here
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.820]   that there was something wrong.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.060]   And, you know, in the north of England,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.980]   everything was closed down.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.460]   The shops were shuttered because there was no demand
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.700]   because everybody lost their jobs.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.100]   It was massive employment.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.620]   You know, when I went off to university in 1984,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.380]   90% youth unemployment in the UK,
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.300]   meaning that when kids left school,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.660]   they didn't have something else to go on to
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.860]   unless they got to university
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.980]   or vocational training or an apprenticeship.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.860]   And most people were still looking, you know,
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.740]   kind of months out of leaving school.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.900]   And so shops were closing
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.380]   'cause people didn't have any money.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.700]   You know, I had 50% male unemployment in some of the towns
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.780]   as the steel works closed down
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.820]   and the wagon works, the railways, for example, in my area.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.220]   But in Moscow, people in theory did have money,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.220]   but there was just, there was nothing to buy.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.380]   Those are the place was falling apart, literally.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.980]   I saw massive sinkholes open up in the street,
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.500]   balconies fall off buildings,
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.780]   you know, one accident after another.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.740]   And then there was, you know, this real kind of sense,
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.820]   even though the vibrancy and excitement
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.620]   and hope of the Gorbachev period,
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.980]   a real sense of the Soviet Union had lost its way.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.140]   And of course it was only a year or so
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.060]   after I left from that exchange program
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.140]   and I'd already started with my degree program
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.540]   in Soviet studies at Harvard,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.260]   that the Soviet Union basically unraveled.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.380]   And it really did unravel.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.060]   It wasn't like it collapsed.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.460]   It was basically that there was so many debates
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.060]   that Gorbachev had sparked off
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.540]   about how to reform the country,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.540]   how to put it on a different path,
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.380]   that, you know, no one was in agreement.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.780]   And it was basically all these fights
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.660]   and debates and disputes among the elites at the center,
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.340]   as well as, you know, basically a loss of faith
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.340]   in the system in the periphery
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.380]   and among the general population
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.860]   that in fact pulled it apart.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.620]   And of course, in 1991,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.380]   you get Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian Federation,
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.740]   then a constituent part of the Soviet Union,
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.260]   together with the presidents of Ukraine and Belarus,
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.220]   all of these being individual parts of the Soviet Union
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.020]   getting together and agreeing and essentially ending it.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.700]   And Gorbachev, you know, so basically I'm there
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.740]   at the peak of this whole kind of period of experimentation
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.260]   and thinking about the future.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.980]   And within a couple of years, it's all kind of gone
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.060]   and it's on a different track entirely.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   - Well, I wonder if we reran the 20th century a thousand times
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.220]   if how many times the Soviet Union would collapse.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.300]   - Yeah, I wonder about that too.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.740]   And I also wonder about what would have happened
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.820]   if it didn't collapse
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.460]   and Gorbachev had found a different direction.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.300]   - I mean, you know, we see a very divisive time now
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.220]   in American history.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.820]   The United States of America has very different cultures,
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.780]   very different beliefs, ideologies within those states,
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.580]   but that's kind of the strength of America
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.180]   is there's these little laboratories of ideas.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.940]   - Until though, that they don't keep together.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.740]   I mean, I've had colleagues who have described
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.820]   what's happening in the West right now
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.540]   was a kind of soft secession with states, you know,
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.420]   going off in their own direction.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.900]   - In which states?
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.740]   - Well, these kinds of conceptions that we have now,
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.780]   divisions between red and blue states
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.740]   because of the fracturing of our politics.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.580]   And I'd always thought that that wouldn't be possible
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.020]   in somewhere like the United States
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.340]   or many other countries as well,
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.860]   because there wasn't that ethnic dimension.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.380]   But in fact, many of the way that people talk about politics
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.420]   has given it that kind of appearance in many respects.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.980]   'Cause look, I mean, we know from the Soviet Union
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.540]   and the Soviet period,
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.820]   and from where you're from, you know, originally in Ukraine,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.860]   that language is not the main signifier of identity
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.780]   and that identity can take all kinds of other forms.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.780]   - That's really interesting.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:45.020]   I mean, but there has to be a deep grievance of some kind.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.580]   If you took a poll in any of the states in the United States,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.020]   I think a very small minority of people
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.220]   would want to actually secede,
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.380]   even in Texas where I spend a lot of my time.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.700]   I just, I think that there is a common
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.900]   kind of pride of nation.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.740]   You know, there's a lot of people complain
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.780]   about government and about how the country's going,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.260]   the way people complain about the weather when it's raining.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.140]   They say, "Oh, this stupid weather, it's raining again."
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.660]   But really what they mean is we're in the smock together.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.820]   There's a together there.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.780]   - I also feel that when I go around,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.100]   'cause I mean, I've spent a lot of time
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.220]   since I wrote my book in last October,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.260]   and this last year going around, I find the same feeling.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.140]   But you know, when I traveled around the Soviet Union,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.900]   back in the late 1980s,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.100]   I didn't get any kind of sense that people wanted
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.300]   to see the end of the Soviet Union either.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.220]   It was an elite project.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.060]   There's a really great book called "Collapse"
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.940]   by Vladislav Zubok, who is a professor
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.940]   at London School of Economics at LSE.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.820]   And Zubok is pretty much my age,
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.580]   and he's from the former Soviet Union, he's Russian.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.820]   And I mean, he describes it very quite aptly
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.060]   about how it was kind of the elites,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.740]   you know, that basically decided
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.100]   to pull the Soviet Union apart.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.820]   And there is a risk of that here as well,
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.620]   when you get partisan politics
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.980]   and people forgetting that they're Americans,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.140]   and they are all in this together,
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.740]   like a lot of the population thing.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.020]   But they think that their own narrow partisan
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.180]   or ideological precepts account for more.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.020]   And in the Soviet case, of course,
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.540]   it was also a power play,
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.420]   in a way that actually can't quite play out
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.340]   in the United States,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.860]   because it was the equivalent of governors in many respects
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.340]   who got together three of them,
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.060]   you know, in the case of the heads of Russia,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.340]   Ukraine, and Belarus,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.100]   who then got rid of basically
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.980]   the central figure of Mikhail Gorbachev.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.860]   It would be a little difficult to do that.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.140]   The dynamic is not the same,
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.500]   but it does worry me of having seen all of that close up
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.940]   in the late 1980s and the early '90s.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.220]   I spent a lot of time in Russia,
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.740]   as well as in Ukraine and Caucasus Central Asia
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.900]   and other places after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.860]   But you kind of see the same elite divisions here
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.380]   in the United States pulling in different directions
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.740]   and straining the overall body politic.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.700]   And the way that national politics gets imposed
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.420]   on local politics,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.580]   in ways that it certainly wasn't
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.580]   when I first came to the US in 1989.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.020]   I didn't honestly, in 1989, when I first came here,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.140]   I didn't know anybody's political affiliation.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.660]   I mean, I rarely knew their religious affiliation.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.100]   And, you know, obviously race was a major phenomenon here
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.820]   that was a shock to me when I first came.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.820]   But many of the kind of the class, regional, geographic,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.460]   you know, kind of political dimensions
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.740]   that I've seen in other places,
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.740]   I didn't see them at play in the same way then as I do now.
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.500]   - And you take a lot of pride
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.580]   to this day of being non-partisan.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.140]   That said, so you served
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.660]   for the George W. Bush, Barack Obama,
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.420]   and Donald Trump administrations,
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   always specializing in Eurasia and Russia.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.700]   You were the top presidential advisor to President,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.540]   former President Donald Trump on Russia and Europe,
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.300]   and famously testified in his first impeachment trial
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.300]   in 2019, saying, "I take great pride
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.340]   in the fact that I'm non-partisan foreign policy expert."
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.460]   So given that context, what does non-partisan mean to you?
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.620]   - Well, it means being very careful
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.820]   about not putting any kind of ideological lens
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.100]   on anything, you know, that I'm analyzing
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.220]   or looking out or saying about foreign policy, for one thing,
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.420]   but also not taking, you know,
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.460]   kind of one stance of one party over another either.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.100]   To be honest, I've always found American politics
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.980]   somewhat confounding because both the Democratic
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.940]   and the Republican Party are pretty big tents.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.540]   I mean, they're coalitions.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.740]   You know, in Europe, it's actually kind of,
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.860]   in some respects, easier to navigate
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.500]   the parameters of political parties
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.860]   because you have quite clear platforms.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.900]   There's also a longer history in many respects, obviously.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.620]   I mean, there's a long history here in the United States
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.980]   of the development of the parties,
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.460]   going back to the late 18th century.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.700]   But in the United Kingdom, for example,
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.900]   in the 20th century, the development of the mass parties,
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.380]   it was quite easy to get a handle on.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.220]   You know, at one point in the UK, for example,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   the parties were real, genuine mass parties
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.660]   with people who were properly members
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.260]   and took part in regular meetings and paid dues.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.100]   And, you know, it was easy to kind of see
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.220]   what they stood for.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.540]   And the same in Europe, you know,
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.220]   when you look at France and in Germany
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.140]   and Western Germany, of course, Italy and elsewhere.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.900]   Here in the United States, it's kind of pretty amorphous.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.780]   You know, the fact that you could kind of register,
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.540]   you know, randomly, it seems to be a Democrat or Republican,
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.740]   like Trump did.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.740]   At one point, he's a Democrat.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.020]   Next thing, he's a Republican.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.420]   And then you kind of usurp a party apparatus.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.660]   But you don't have to be, you're not vetted in any way.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.540]   You're not kind of, you know,
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.700]   they don't check you out to see
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.940]   if you have ideological coherence.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.660]   You know, you could have someone like Bernie Sanders
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.340]   on the other side, on the left,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.660]   you know, basically calling himself a socialist
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.300]   and running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.980]   So, you know, kind of in many respects,
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.900]   parties in the United States are much more loose movements.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.820]   And I think you can, you know,
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.860]   it's almost like a kind of an a la carte menu
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.220]   of different things that people can pick out.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.820]   And it's more over time, as I've noticed,
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.180]   become more like a kind of an affiliation
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.700]   even with the sporting team.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.740]   I mean, I get very shocked by the way that people say,
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.260]   well, I couldn't do this because, you know,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.500]   that's my side and I couldn't do anything
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.300]   and I couldn't support someone for the other side.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.740]   I mean, I have a relative in my extended family here
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.580]   who is a, you know, died in the war Republican
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.580]   and on, you know, family holiday,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.180]   there was a book on their table,
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.620]   said a hundred reasons for voting for a Democrat.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.140]   And I said, hey, are you thinking
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.500]   of shifting party affiliation?
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.140]   Then I opened the book and it's blank.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:01.980]   It was pretty funny.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.300]   I had to laugh.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.900]   I thought, well, there you go then.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.420]   You know, there's just, there's no way that, you know,
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.580]   people can pull themselves out of these frames.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.940]   So for me, it's very important
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.420]   to have that independence of thought.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.820]   I think you can be politically engaged on the issues,
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.380]   but, you know, basically without taking a stance
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.820]   that's defined by some ideology
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.940]   or some sense of kind of parties on affiliation.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.220]   - I think I tweeted about this, maybe not eloquently.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.420]   And the statement, if I remember correctly,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.420]   was something like, if you honestly can't find
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.540]   a good thing that Donald Trump did
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.340]   or a good thing that Joe Biden did,
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   you're not thinking about ideas.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.500]   You just pick the tribe.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.740]   I mean, it was more eloquent than that,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.140]   but it was basically, this is a really good test
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.740]   to see are you actually thinking
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.700]   about like how to solve problems
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.300]   versus like your red team or blue team,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.740]   like a sporting team.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.740]   Can you find a good idea of Donald Trump's that you like,
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.140]   if you're somebody who is against Donald Trump
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.020]   and like acknowledge it to yourself privately?
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.500]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.820]   I'm glad he said that.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.140]   - Or he's even asking the right kinds of questions,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.180]   which he often did actually.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.580]   I mean, obviously he put them in a way
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.500]   that most of us wouldn't have done,
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.700]   but there was often kind of questions
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.660]   about why is this happening?
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.620]   Why are we doing this?
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.940]   And we have to challenge ourselves all the time.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.380]   So yeah, actually, why are we doing that?
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.220]   And then you have to really inspect it
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.540]   and say whether it's actually worth continuing that way
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.340]   or they should be doing something differently.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.500]   Now he had a more kind of destructive quality
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.660]   to those kinds of questions,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.420]   about maybe it's the real estate developer in him
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.060]   that was taking a big wrecking ball
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.940]   to all of these kinds of sacred edifices
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.780]   and things like that.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.140]   So often, if you really paid attention,
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.180]   he was asking a valid set of questions
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.020]   about why do we continue to do things like this?
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.380]   Now, he didn't often have answers
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.340]   about what he was gonna do in response,
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.660]   but those questions still had to be asked
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.180]   and we shouldn't be just rejecting them out of turn.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.220]   - And another strength,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.980]   the thing that people often,
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.740]   that criticize Donald Trump will say is a weakness
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.740]   is his lack of civility can be a strength
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.820]   because I feel like sometimes bureaucracy functions
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.140]   on excessive civility.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.180]   Actually, I've seen this, it's not just,
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.700]   it's bureaucracy in all forms.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.980]   In tech companies, as they grow,
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.580]   everybody kinda, you're getting a pretty good salary,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.740]   everyone's comfortable and there's a meeting
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.620]   and you discuss how to move stuff forward.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.260]   And you don't wanna be the asshole in the room
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.940]   that says, "Why are we doing this this way?
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.940]   "This could be unethical, this is hurting the world,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.020]   "this is totally a dumb idea."
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.300]   Like, I mean, I could give specific examples
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.580]   that I have on my mind currently that are technical,
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.540]   but the point is oftentimes the person that's needed
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.180]   in that room is an asshole.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.020]   - Yeah. - That's why Steve Jobs worked,
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.980]   that's why Elon Musk works, you have to roll in,
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.900]   that's what first principles thinking looks like.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.020]   - The one bit when it doesn't work
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.820]   is when they start name-calling.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.220]   - Sure. - Kind of inciting violence
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.860]   against the people that they disagree with.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.980]   So that was kind of your problem,
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.940]   because I mean, often, when I was in the administration,
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.060]   I had all of Europe in my portfolio as well as Russia.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.660]   And there were many times when we were dealing
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.020]   with our European colleagues
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.220]   where he was asking some pretty valid questions
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.300]   about, "Well, why should we do this if you're doing that?"
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.900]   For example, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.460]   the United States has been opposed
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.620]   to Europe's reliance on gas and oil exports from Russia.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.660]   You know, the Soviet Union since the '70s and '80s.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.820]   And Trump kept pushing this idea about,
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.180]   "So why are we spending so much money on NATO
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.020]   and NATO defense, and we're all talking about this,
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.340]   if you're then basically paying billions to Russia for gas?
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.900]   Isn't this contradictory?"
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.580]   And of course it was, but it was the way that he did it.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.020]   And I actually, one instance had a discussion
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.620]   with a European defense minister,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.700]   basically said to me, "Look, he's saying exactly
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.580]   the same things as people said before him,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.060]   including former Defense Secretary Gates.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.020]   It's just the way he says it."
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.100]   You know, so they took offense.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.860]   And then as a result of that, they wouldn't take action
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.900]   because they took offense at what he said.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.700]   So it was a kind of then a way of,
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.580]   "Could you find some other means of,
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.060]   you know, massaging this communication
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.180]   to kind of make it effective?"
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.620]   Which we would always try to focus on.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.700]   Because it's a kind of, it was the delivery.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.500]   But the actual message was often spot on
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.660]   in those kinds of issues.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.580]   I mean, he was actually highlighting,
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.380]   you know, these ridiculous discrepancies
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.740]   between what people said and what they actually did.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.140]   - And it's the delivery, the charisma in the room too.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.380]   I'm also understanding the power of that, of a leader.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.580]   It's not just about what you do at a podium,
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.900]   but in a room with advisors, how you talk about stuff,
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.580]   how you convince other leaders.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.420]   - Yeah, you don't do it through gratuitous insults
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.460]   and incitement to violence.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.860]   That's one of the things you just,
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.900]   you don't get anywhere on that front.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.580]   - Well, I mean, it's possible.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.180]   - Tough measures and maximum pressure
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.780]   often though does work.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.540]   Because there were, you know, often times where,
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.980]   you know, that kind of relentless,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.620]   you know, nagging about something or constantly raising it
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.420]   actually did have results, but it hadn't previously.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.300]   So there's, you know, the maximum pressure,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.260]   if it, you know, kind of kept on it in the right way.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.020]   And, you know, often when we were, you know,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.380]   coming in behind on pushing on issues,
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.580]   you know, related to NATO or, you know,
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.940]   other things in this same sphere,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.260]   it would actually have an effect.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.500]   It just doesn't get talked about
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   because it gets overshadowed by, you know,
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.620]   all of the other kind of stuff around this
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.100]   and the way that, you know,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.900]   he interacted with people and treated people.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.500]   - What was the heart, the key insights
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.420]   to your testimony in that impeachment?
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.460]   - Look, I think there is a straight line
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.700]   between that whole series of episodes
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.820]   and the current war in Ukraine.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.580]   Because Vladimir Putin and the people around him
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   in the Kremlin concluded that the US
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.380]   did not care one little bit about Ukraine
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.300]   and that it was just a game.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.020]   For Trump, it was a personal game.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.060]   He was basically trying to get Vladimir Zelensky
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.180]   to do him a personal favor related to his desire
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.460]   to stay on in power in the 2020 election.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.340]   And generally, they just thought that we were using Ukraine
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.340]   as some kind of proxy or some kind of instrument
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.660]   within our own domestic politics
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.620]   'cause that's what it looked like.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.020]   And I think that, you know, as a result of that,
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.940]   Putin, you know, took the idea away
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.820]   that he could, you know, do whatever he wanted.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.300]   We were constantly being asked, even prior to this,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:58.300]   by people around Putin, like, you know,
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.020]   Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the National Security
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.500]   Council equivalent in Russia, who we met with frequently,
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.140]   "What's Ukraine to you? We don't get it.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.900]   You know, why do you even care?"
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.340]   So they thought that we weren't serious.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.260]   They thought that we weren't serious
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.940]   about Ukraine's territorial integrity and its independence
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.540]   or it is a national security player.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.780]   And Putin also thought that he could just manipulate
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.580]   the political space in the United States.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.980]   Actually, he could because what he was doing
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.980]   was seeding all this dissent and fueling, you know,
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.660]   already in a debate inside of US politics,
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.060]   the kinds of, you know, things that we see
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.620]   just kind of coming out now.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.020]   This kind of idea that Ukraine was a burden,
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.300]   that Ukraine was, you know, basically just trying
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.980]   to extract things from the United States,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.780]   that Ukraine had somehow played inside of US politics.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.620]   Trump was convinced that the Ukrainians
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.620]   had done something against him,
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.900]   that they had intervened in the elections.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.180]   And that was kind of, you know,
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.260]   a combination of people around him
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.300]   trying to find an excuse as to, you know,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.380]   kind of what had happened in the election
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.740]   to kind of divert attention away
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.460]   from Russia's interference in 2016
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.980]   and the Russians themselves poisoning the well
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.420]   against Ukraine.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.620]   So you had a kind of a confluence of circumstances there.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.980]   And what I was trying to get across in that testimony
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.820]   was the national security imperative
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.220]   of basically getting our act together here
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.980]   and separating out what was going on
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.740]   in our domestic politics from what was happening
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.460]   in our national security and foreign policy.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.420]   I mean, I think we contributed in that whole mess
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.780]   around the impeachment,
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.900]   but it's the whole parallel policies around Ukraine
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.500]   to the war that we now have that we're confronting.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.700]   - Signaling the value we place in peace and stability
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.660]   in that part of the world,
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.740]   or the reverse by saying we don't care.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.780]   - Yeah, we seem to not care.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.620]   It was just a game.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:54.620]   - But the US role in that war is a very complicated one.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.900]   That's one of the variables.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.260]   Just on that testimony,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.580]   did it in part break your heart
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.660]   that you had to testify essentially
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.860]   against the president of the United States?
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.300]   Or is that not how you saw it?
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.540]   - I don't think I would describe it in that way.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.500]   I think what I was was deeply disappointed
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.500]   by what I saw happening in the American political space.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.580]   I didn't expect it.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.380]   Look, I was a starry-eyed immigrant.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.420]   I came to the United States with all of these expectations
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.260]   of what the place would be.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.500]   I'd already been disabused of some of the,
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.180]   let's just say rosy perspectives
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.220]   I had of the United States.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:49.220]   I'd been shocked by the depths of racial problems.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.620]   It doesn't even sum up the problems
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.660]   we have in the United States.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.540]   I mean, I couldn't get my head around it when I first came.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.300]   I mean, I'd read about slavery in American history,
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.340]   but I hadn't fully fathomed really the kind of the way
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.500]   that it was ripping apart the United States.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.460]   I mean, I'd read Alex's talk, Phil,
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.380]   and he'd commented on this,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.460]   and it obviously hadn't kind of changed
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.260]   to the way that one would have expect all this time
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.420]   from the 18th century onwards.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.060]   So that was kind of one thing
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.900]   that I realized the civil rights movement
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.580]   and all of these acts of expansion of suffrage
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.380]   and everything else were imperfect at best.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.380]   I was born in '65, the same time as the Civil Rights Act,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.700]   and there's a heck of a long way still to go.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.940]   So I wasn't, let's just say,
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.940]   as starry-eyed about everything as I'd been before,
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.300]   but I really saw an incredible competence
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.620]   and professionalism in the US government,
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.020]   it was in the election system and the integrity of it.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.180]   And I mean, I really saw that.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.500]   I saw that the United States was the gold standard
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.140]   for kind of some of its institutions.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.860]   And I worked in the National Intelligence Council,
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.340]   and I'd seen the way that the United States
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.460]   had tried to address the problems that it had faced
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.620]   in its whole botched analysis of Iraq
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.020]   and this terrible strategic blunder of,
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.380]   honestly, a crime in my view of invading Iraq,
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.300]   but the way that people were trying to deal with that
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.140]   in the aftermath.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.420]   I mean, I went into the National Intelligence Council
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.140]   and the DNI, the office of the Director
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.980]   of National Intelligence,
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.380]   when they were coming to terms with what had gone wrong
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.860]   in the whole analysis about Iraq in 2003,
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.780]   in the whole wake of people trying to pull together
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.180]   after 9/11 and to learn all of the lessons from all of this.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.740]   And I saw just really genuine striving and deliberation
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.660]   about what had gone wrong,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.740]   what lessons could we learn from this?
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.580]   And then suddenly I found myself in this,
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.740]   I couldn't really describe it in any words,
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.580]   just totally crazy looking glass,
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.060]   thinking of Alice in Wonderland,
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.380]   Alice Through the Looking Glass version
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.700]   of American politics.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.140]   I mean, I'd seen everything starting to unravel
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.380]   over a kind of a period of time
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.940]   before I'd been asked to be in the administration,
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.300]   but I did not expect it to be that bad, I honestly didn't.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.140]   I mean, I'd been warned by people that this was
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.060]   really a very serious turn
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.220]   that the United States had taken,
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.660]   but I really thought that national security
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.580]   would still be uppermost in people's minds.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.140]   And it was, I mean, a lot of the people that I work with,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.860]   but what I found, if you want to use that term
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.780]   of heartbreaking, was the way in which
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   all of these principles that I had really bought into
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.340]   and tried to uphold in the United States government
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.100]   and in the things that we were trying to do
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:28.940]   with me and my colleagues
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.260]   was just being thrown out the window.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.820]   And that I would have to step up in defense of them
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:35.940]   and in defense of my colleagues
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.340]   who were being lambasted and criticized
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.460]   and given death threats for actually standing up
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.780]   and doing their own jobs.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.180]   - In particular on the topic of Ukraine?
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.260]   - Not just on Ukraine, but on national security overall.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.940]   So, I mean, I'd gone through this whole period
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.340]   even before we got to that point
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.380]   of seeing non-partisan government officials
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.060]   being attacked from all sides, left and right,
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.500]   but especially the right,
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.620]   and being basically accused of being partisan hacks,
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.500]   you know, deep state, coup plotters, you name it.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.820]   There, patriotism being questioned as well.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.460]   And a lot of people I work with in government,
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.980]   like myself, naturalized Americans,
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.300]   a lot of them were immigrants, many were refugees,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.140]   and many people had fought in wars
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.540]   on behalf of the United States and Iraq and Afghanistan,
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.380]   being blown up.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.900]   And, you know, they put their lives on the line.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.100]   They put their family lives on the line, you know,
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.660]   because they believed in America.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.260]   And they were just, they were reflections of Americans
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.180]   from all kinds of walks of life.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.860]   It's what really made, you know,
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.300]   that cliche of America great.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.060]   It wasn't, you know, whatever it was,
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.340]   it was being bandied around
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.820]   in these crude, crass political terms.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.900]   It was just the strength of an incredible set of people
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.940]   who've come together from all kinds of places
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.900]   and decided that they're going to make a go of it,
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.340]   and that they're going to, you know,
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.580]   try to work towards the whole, you know,
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.740]   idea of the preamble of the Constitution
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.100]   towards a more perfect union.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.420]   And I, you know, I saw people doing that every single day,
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.380]   despite all of the things that they could criticize
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.300]   about the United States,
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.900]   still believing in what they were doing
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.140]   and believing in the promise of the country,
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.340]   which is what I felt like.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.660]   And then here we were,
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.060]   people were just treating it like a game,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.380]   and they were treating people like dirt,
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.300]   and they were just playing games with people's lives.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.940]   I mean, we all had death threats.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.340]   You know, people's, you know, whole careers,
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.780]   which were not just careers for their own self-aggrandizement,
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   but careers of public service,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.220]   trying to give something back, were being shattered.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.980]   And I found, you know, I just thought to myself,
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.020]   I'm not going to let that happen,
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.740]   because, you know, I've come from a,
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.660]   well, are they going to send me back
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.180]   to Bishop Auckland in County Durham?
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.540]   Fine, I'm totally fine to go back, you know,
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.020]   because I could do something back there,
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.420]   but I'm not going to let this happen.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.940]   I've made this choice to come to America.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.340]   I'm all in.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.980]   And these guys are just behaving like a bunch of idiots,
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:45.820]   and they're ruining it.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.860]   You know, they're ruining it for everybody.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.900]   - So the personal attacks on competent,
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.620]   hardworking, passionate people
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.620]   who have love for what they do in their heart,
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.020]   similar stuff I've seen for virologists and biologists,
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.340]   so colleagues, basically scientists,
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.420]   in the time of COVID when there's a bunch of cynicism,
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.540]   and there was just personal attacks,
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.980]   including death threats on people that, you know,
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.540]   work on viruses, work on vaccines.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.460]   - Yeah, and they're going around in, you know,
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.060]   basically with protective gear on
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.500]   in case somebody shoots them in the street.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.220]   That's just absurd.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:23.780]   - But let me zoom out from the individual people.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.780]   - Yeah.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.540]   - And actually look at the situations that we saw
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.540]   in the George W. Bush, Obama, and Donald Trump presidencies.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:41.180]   And I'd like to sort of criticize each
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:45.940]   by not the treatment of individual people,
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.340]   but by the results.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.140]   - Right, yeah, I think that's fair, yeah.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.220]   - So if we look at George W. Bush,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.300]   and maybe you can give me insights,
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.860]   this is what's fascinating to me.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.860]   When you have extremely competent,
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:02.460]   smart, hardworking, well-intentioned people,
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.740]   how do we, as a system,
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.180]   make mistakes in foreign policy?
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:13.180]   So the big mistake you can characterize in different ways,
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.540]   but in George W. Bush is invading Iraq.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.380]   - Yeah, that's key.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.980]   - Or maybe how it was invaded,
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:23.380]   or maybe how the decision process was made to invade it.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.180]   Again, Afghanistan, maybe not the invasion,
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.780]   but details around, like, having a plan
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.740]   about, you know, how to withdraw, all that kind of stuff.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:39.340]   And Barack Obama, to me, similarly,
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:44.340]   is a man who came to fame early on
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.580]   for being somebody who was against,
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.540]   a rare voice against the invasion of Iraq,
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:53.520]   which was actually a brave thing to do at that time.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.860]   And nevertheless, he, I mean, I don't know the numbers,
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.780]   but I think he was the president for years
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.620]   over increased drone attacks,
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.680]   everything from a foreign policy perspective,
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.780]   the military industrial complex,
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:19.520]   that machine grew in power under him, not shrunk,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.220]   and did not withdraw from Afghanistan.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.900]   And then with Donald Trump,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   the criticisms that you're presenting,
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.500]   sort of the personal attacks, the chaos,
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.140]   the partisanship of people
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.140]   that are supposed to be non-partisan.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.980]   So that, you know, if you sort of to steel man the chaos,
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.380]   to make the case for chaos,
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.340]   maybe we need to shake up the machine,
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.660]   throw a wrench into the engine, into the gears.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.260]   And then every individual gear
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.140]   is gonna be very upset with that, because it's a wrench.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.220]   It's not, it's an inefficient process,
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.420]   but maybe it leads for government.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.520]   It forces the system as a whole, not the individuals,
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.840]   but the system to reconsider how things are done.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.920]   So obviously all of those things,
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.100]   the actual results are not that impressive.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.820]   - You could have done that on the latter,
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:16.740]   you know, shaking things up,
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.300]   because I'm all one for questioning
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.460]   and trying to shake things up as well
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.220]   and do things differently.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.420]   But, you know, the question is,
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.940]   if you bring the whole system down with nothing,
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.020]   ideas of putting it to place.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.540]   Like, I mean, like many people,
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.940]   I've studied the Bolshevik Revolution
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.140]   and, you know, many others as well.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.260]   And, you know, kind of what's, you know,
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.840]   what's the pattern here, you know,
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.060]   that actually fits into what you're talking about here
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.400]   is a kind of rigidity of thought
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.740]   on the part of revolutionaries in many cases as well.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.780]   And also narcissism.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.740]   In fact, I think that it takes a pretty, you know,
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.540]   strong sense of yourself, you know,
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.580]   kind of an own yourself
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.860]   to want to be president of the United States, for example.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.100]   We see that in, you know,
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.820]   many of our presidents have been narcissists
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.700]   to different, you know, kind of degrees.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.780]   You think about Lenin, you know, for example,
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.380]   and people can go back and read about Lenin.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.060]   He formed his views when he was about 18
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.820]   and he never shook them off.
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.220]   He never evolved.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.380]   He didn't have any kind of diversity of thought.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.900]   And when systems go awry,
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.060]   it's when they don't bring in different perspectives.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.560]   And so, you know, Trump,
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.660]   if he brought in different perspectives
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.500]   and actually listened to them
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.320]   and not just, you know,
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.300]   believed that he himself knew better than anyone else
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.340]   and then tried to divide everybody against each other,
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.780]   it would have been a different matter.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.180]   It's a tragedy of a completely
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.740]   and utterly lost set of opportunities
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.300]   because of the flaws in his own nature.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.140]   Because, I mean, again,
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:29.980]   there was all kinds of things
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.380]   that he could have done to shake things up.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.940]   And so many people around him
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.620]   remained completely disappointed.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.500]   And of course he divided
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.260]   and pitted people against each other,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.340]   you know, creating so much factionalism
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.820]   in American politics that, you know,
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.060]   people have forgotten they're Americans.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.780]   They think that they're red or blue,
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.060]   you know, parts of teams.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.940]   And, you know, if you go back over history,
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.460]   that's kind of a recipe for war and, you know,
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.780]   internal conflict.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.620]   You go back to, you know,
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.260]   the Byzantine Empire, for example,
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.220]   there's the famous episode of the Nike riots
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.620]   in Constantinople where the whole city gets trashed
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   because the greens, the reds, the blues,
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.460]   and these various sporting teams in the Hippodrome
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.420]   get whipped up by political forces
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.020]   and they, you know, they pull the place apart.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.900]   And that's, you know, kind of where we've been heading
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.380]   on some of these trajectories.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.620]   But the other point is when you look back,
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.460]   you know, at Bush and Obama as well,
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:20.020]   there's a very narrow circle of decision-making.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:20.980]   You know, at Bush period,
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.700]   it's the focus on the executive branch
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.660]   with Dick Cheney as the vice president
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.340]   being very fixated on it.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.340]   And Obama, it's, you know, he and, you know,
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.500]   kind of the bright young things around him,
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.820]   you know, from, he himself is, you know,
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.740]   kind of intellectually, you know,
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.460]   one might say arrogant in many respects, you know,
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.500]   he was a very smart guy and, you know,
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.180]   he's convinced that he has,
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.860]   and he ruminates over a lot of things,
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.260]   but he's the person who makes, you know,
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.940]   a lot of decisions.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.740]   And basically George W. Bush
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.460]   used to call himself the decider as well, right?
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.620]   I mean, they're all the people who make the decisions.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.460]   It's not always as consultative as you might think it is.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.380]   And for Trump, it's like,
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.980]   I'm not listening to anybody at all.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.460]   You know, it's just me and whatever it is
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:04.060]   that I've woken up today and I've decided to do.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.860]   So I think, you know, the problem with all of our systems
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.940]   and why we don't get results
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.580]   is because we don't draw upon, you know,
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.700]   the diversity of opinion and all the ideas of,
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.540]   you know, people out there.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.580]   Like you do that in science.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:15.420]   I mean, when, I mean,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.820]   all of my friends and relatives are in science.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.340]   They've got these incredible collaborations with people,
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.300]   you know, across the world.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.420]   I mean, how did we get to these vaccines for the COVID virus?
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   Because of this incredible years of collaboration
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.620]   and of, you know, sharing results and sharing ideas.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.060]   And our whole system has become ossified.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.980]   You know, we think about the congressional system,
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:36.820]   for example, as well.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.820]   And there's, you know, this kind of rapid, you know,
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.620]   turnover that you have in Congress every two years.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.180]   You know, there's no incentive for people,
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.180]   you know, basically to work with others.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.660]   They're constantly campaigning.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.900]   They're constantly trying to appeal to whatever their base is
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.620]   and they don't really care about, you know,
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.980]   some do, you know, of their constituents,
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.220]   but a lot of people don't.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.540]   And the Senate, it's all kind of focused on the game
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.820]   of legislation for so many people as well.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.620]   Not focusing again on that kind of sense about
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.100]   what are we doing like scientists to kind of work together,
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.380]   you know, for the good of the country to push things along.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.660]   And also our government also is siloed.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.700]   There's not a lot of mechanisms
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.900]   for bringing people together.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.900]   There ought to be in things like
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.540]   the National Security Council,
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.420]   the National Intelligence Council actually did that
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.580]   quite successfully at times for analysis that I saw.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.100]   But we don't have, you know,
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.020]   we have it within the National Institutes of Health,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.500]   but we saw the CDC break down on this, you know,
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.580]   kind of front.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.220]   We don't have sufficient to those institutions
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.420]   that bring people together
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.460]   from all kinds of different backgrounds.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.020]   You know, one of the other problems that we've had
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.820]   with government, with the federal government
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.420]   over, you know, state and local government,
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.780]   is it's actually quite small.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.020]   People think that the federal government's huge
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.980]   because we've got postal service and the military
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:48.820]   that are part of it,
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.180]   but your actual federal government employees
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.060]   is a very small number.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.060]   And, you know, the senior executive service part of that
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.540]   is the older white guys, you know,
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.620]   who kind of come up all the way over the last,
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.020]   you know, several decades.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.780]   We have a really hard time bringing in younger people
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.260]   into that kind of government service,
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.700]   unless they're political hacks, you know,
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.540]   and they want to, you know, kind of,
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.060]   or they're kind of looking for power
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.780]   and, you know, sort of influence.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.660]   We have a hard time getting people like yourself
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.580]   and other, you know, younger people kind of coming in
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.900]   to make a career out of public service
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.700]   and also retaining them because, you know,
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.260]   people with incredible skills often get poached away
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.380]   into the private sector.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.020]   And, you know, a lot of the people that I work with
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.580]   in the national security side are now at all kinds of,
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:36.060]   you know, high-end political consultancies,
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.460]   or they've gone to Silicon Valley
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.340]   and they've gone to this place and that place
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.380]   because after a time as a younger person,
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.460]   they're not rising up particularly quickly
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.340]   because there's a pretty rigid way of looking at
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.420]   the hierarchies and the promotion schemes.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.260]   And they're also getting lambasted by everybody.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.500]   People like, you know, public servants,
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.740]   they're not really public servants.
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:58.460]   There's this whole lack and loss
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.260]   of a kind of a faith in public service.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.540]   And, you know, the last few years
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:04.260]   have really done a lot of damage.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.940]   We need to revitalize our government system
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.060]   to get better results.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.180]   We need to bring more people in,
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.580]   even if it's, you know, for a period of time,
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:14.780]   not just through expensive contracts
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:17.980]   for, you know, the big consulting companies
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.860]   and, you know, other entities
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.300]   that do government work out there,
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.180]   but getting people in for a period of time,
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.700]   expanding some of these management fellowships
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.580]   and the White House fellows,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.460]   and, you know, bringing in, you know,
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.460]   scientists, you know, from the outside,
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.100]   giving, you know, that kind of opportunity
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.820]   for collaboration that we see in other spheres.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.460]   - I think that's actually one of the biggest roles
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.580]   for a president that, for some reason,
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:46.460]   during the election, that's never talked about
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.940]   is how good are you at hiring
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:53.740]   and creating a culture of, like, attracting the right,
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.580]   I mean, basically chief hire.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:00.580]   When you think of a CEO, like, the great CEOs are,
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.140]   I mean, maybe people don't talk about it that often,
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.180]   but they do more often for CEOs than they do for presidents,
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.460]   is, like, how good are you at building a team?
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.620]   - Well, we make it really difficult
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:12.740]   because of the political process.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.300]   I mean, and also because we have
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.060]   so many political appointments,
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.740]   we ought to have less, to be honest.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.260]   I mean, if you look at other governments around the world,
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.660]   you know, that are smaller,
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.300]   it's much easier for them to hire people in.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.580]   You know, some of the most successful governments
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.140]   are much smaller, and it's not that I say that, you know,
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.620]   the government is necessarily too big,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.980]   but it's just thinking about each unit in a different way.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:35.340]   We shouldn't be having so many political appointments.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.060]   We should kind of find more professional appointments,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.180]   more non-partisan appointments,
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.780]   because, you know, every single administration
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.900]   that we've had over the last,
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.740]   let's see, span of presidencies,
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.980]   they have jobs that are unfulfilled
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.060]   because they can't get their candidates
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.580]   through Congress and the Senate
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.140]   because of all the kind of political games
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.140]   that are being played.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:57.140]   I know loads of people have just been held up
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.820]   because it's just on the whim of, you know,
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.380]   some member of Congress,
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.180]   even though that the actual position that they want
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.460]   is really technical and doesn't really care about what,
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.980]   you know, what political preference they particularly have.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.660]   So I think we have to try to look
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.020]   at the whole system of governments
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.340]   in the way that we would over, you know,
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.780]   other professional sectors,
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.220]   and to try to think about this as, just as you said there,
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.100]   that this is a government
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.500]   that's actually running our country.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.220]   This is an operating system,
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.300]   and you wouldn't operate it like that
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.500]   if you were, you know, looking at it
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.660]   in any kind of rational way.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.980]   It shouldn't be so ideologically or partisan tainted.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.340]   - So you're- - It's every level anyway.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.380]   So I would actually just make a bid
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.540]   for a more non-partisan approach
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.980]   to a lot of the parts of government.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.700]   You can still kind of bring in, you know,
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.020]   the political and premature,
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.820]   but also you have to explain to people
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.740]   writ large in America as well, that this is your government.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.820]   And that actually you could also be part of this.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.940]   You know, things like the Small Business Administration,
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.540]   the US Department of Agriculture,
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.580]   you know, all these kinds of things
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.540]   that actually people interact with,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.380]   but they don't even know it,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.540]   the Postal Service, you know, all of these things.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.700]   I mean, people actually,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.980]   when you ask them about different functions of government,
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.980]   they have a lot of support for it.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.620]   The National Park Service, you know, for example,
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.060]   it's just when you talk about government
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.500]   in an abstract way, like, "Oh, yeah, no, too much,
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.940]   "bloated, you know, not efficient and effective."
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.260]   But if you kind of bring it down more
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.900]   to the kind of local and federal levels,
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.220]   that's kind of, you know, when people really see it.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.740]   If people could see kind of themselves reflected,
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.620]   and many of the people have gone into public service,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.060]   I think that they would- - Yeah, they need to be-
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.340]   - You know, have a lot more support for it.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.020]   - More like superstars,
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:36.020]   like individuals that are like big on social media,
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.580]   big in the public eye, and having fun with it,
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.780]   and showing cool stuff that is not,
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.380]   'cause right now, a lot of people see government
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.620]   as basically partisan warfare,
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:52.620]   and then it just, it makes it unpleasant to do the job.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:56.100]   It makes it uninspiring for people looking in from outside
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.940]   about what's going on inside government,
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.140]   all of it, the whole thing.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.780]   But you are, you know, just, with all due respect,
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:06.900]   you're a pretty rare individual in terms of nonpartisanship.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.580]   Actually, your whole life story,
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.340]   the humbling aspect of your upbringing
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.140]   and everything like that,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:19.300]   do you think it's possible to have a lot of nonpartisan
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.260]   experts in government?
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:26.260]   Like, can you be a top presidential advisor on Russia
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   for 10 years, for 15 years, and remain nonpartisan?
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.340]   - I think you can.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.060]   I don't think that's advisable, though, by the way,
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.620]   'cause I mean, I don't think anybody should be there,
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.460]   you know, to see on forever.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.780]   - So your first advice is to fight yourself after 10 years?
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.860]   - Well, you should definitely have term limits,
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.220]   just like you should in everything, right?
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.380]   I mean, it's just like tenure in university.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.300]   - Well, we all have term limits.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.620]   - Yeah, you kind of, you know, we do,
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.700]   we have natural term limits,
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.260]   but you know, you're kind of, you know,
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.660]   basically bottling it up for other people.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.540]   I mean, you know, what I'm trying to do now,
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.940]   I mean, I'm 57 now, and I always try to work with,
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.460]   you know, people from different generations than me,
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.860]   just like, you know, I've really benefited from these,
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.420]   you know, kind of mentorships of people older.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.580]   You can, you know, mentor up and well and mentor down.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   I mean, I would, you know, try to get, you know,
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.860]   people from different backgrounds and different generations
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.300]   to work together in teams, obviously.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.900]   I'd like to more team networked kind of approach to things,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.380]   the kind of things that you get again in science, right?
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.740]   I mean, all these ideas are gonna come
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.940]   from all kinds of different perspectives.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.340]   Age and experience does count for something,
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.020]   but, you know, fresh ideas and coming in
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.260]   and looking at a problem from a different perspective
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.100]   and seeing something that somebody else hasn't seen before.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.220]   I mean, I just, you know, kind of love working
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.340]   in an environment with all kinds of different people
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.620]   and people who don't agree with you.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.500]   You need people to take you on and say,
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.860]   "Absolutely, that's crap."
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.140]   You know, kind of, "Where did you come up with that from?"
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.380]   And you go, "Hang on."
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.260]   Well, explain to me why you think so.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.900]   And then, you know, you have this kind of
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.380]   iterative process back and forth.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.740]   I mean, I would always encourage my colleagues
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.420]   to tell me when they thought I was wrong.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.460]   I mean, sometimes I didn't agree
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.660]   because I didn't see the reasoning,
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.740]   but other times I'd be like, "They're right."
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.820]   You know, "That was a complete mistake.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.940]   I need to admit that."
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.900]   And, you know, kind of, "We need to figure out
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.700]   a different way of doing things."
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.260]   But the one point I do want to get across
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.660]   is there were a lot of people
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.540]   who were non-partisan that I worked with.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.580]   I mean, honestly, in most of the jobs that I had,
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.820]   up until more recently,
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.260]   I had no idea about people's political affiliation.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.740]   It's just when you get into this kind of
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.900]   highly charged partisan environment,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.180]   they kind of force people, you know, to make decisions.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.540]   And when you have, you know, one political party
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.460]   or political faction that's trying to usurp power,
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.260]   it does make it quite difficult.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.380]   I mean, that's the situation that we're in right now.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.660]   And, you know, we're seeing some of the things
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.060]   happening in the United States I've seen
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.340]   and studied in other settings
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.220]   or seen for myself happening.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.180]   You know, when you have a president
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.460]   who wants to cling onto power,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.180]   you know, you've got to call that out.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.700]   You know, is that a partisan act
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.700]   or is that a kind of, you know,
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.420]   a defense of that larger political system
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.500]   that you're part of?
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.780]   You know, so I think we've got to recognize that
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.860]   even if you're not partisan,
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.500]   you can be politically engaged.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.300]   And, you know, sometimes you just have to
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.740]   stand up there and speak out,
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.260]   which is, you know, what I did
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.540]   and what others did as well.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.300]   None of those people who spoke out,
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.420]   you know, can initially saw that as a partisan act,
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.860]   even if some of them since then
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.700]   have decided to make political choices
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.940]   they hadn't made before.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.820]   Because, you know, the situation actually forced people
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.020]   into, you know, taking sides.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.380]   It's very hard to still stay above the fray
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.220]   when you've got, you know,
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.900]   someone who's trying to perpetrate a coup.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.980]   - Yeah, just to linger on that,
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.220]   I think it's hard and it's the courageous thing to do
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220]   to criticize a president
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.620]   and not fall into partisanship after.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.220]   Because the whole world will assume
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.260]   if you criticize Donald Trump,
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:47.540]   that you're clearly a Democrat.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.780]   And so they will just,
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.620]   everybody will criticize you for being a Democrat.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.700]   And then, so you're now stuck in that.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.580]   So you're going to just embrace that role.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.820]   But to still walk the nonpartisan route
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.460]   after the criticism, that's the hard road.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.300]   So not let the criticisms break you into,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:10.540]   you know, into a certain kind of ideological
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.380]   set of positions.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.180]   - I mean, our political system needs revitalization.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:17.380]   We need to be taking a long, hard look at ourselves here.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.420]   And I think what people are calling out for,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.940]   look, there's a vast swath of the population,
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.780]   like me, who are unaffiliated.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.980]   You know, maybe some lean in one direction over another.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.620]   And unaffiliated doesn't mean you don't have views
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.460]   about things and political opinions.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.940]   And, you know, you may sound quite extreme on,
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.380]   you know, some of those, you know,
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.140]   either from a left or right perspective.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.180]   What people are looking for is kind of an articulation,
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.780]   you know, of things in a kind of a clear way
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.060]   that they can get a handle on.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.900]   And they're also looking for a representation.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.780]   Somebody who's going to be there for you,
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.340]   you know, not part of a kind of a rigid team
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.780]   that you're excluded from, you know, the ins and the outs.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.140]   But what people are looking at now,
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.620]   they're looking at that in the workplace
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   because they're not finding that in politics.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.540]   You're actually getting workers, you know,
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.740]   pushing the, people talk about the rise of the worker,
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.060]   but people just saying, hang on a sec,
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.860]   you know, the most important space that I'm in right now
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.140]   is my workplace because that's where my benefits are from.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.540]   They're not coming from the state.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.100]   I mean, that's a peculiarity of the United States system.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.820]   You know, in Britain, you've got the National Health Service
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.140]   and you've got all the kind of national wide benefits.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.420]   You know, you're not tethered to your employer
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.660]   like you are in the United States.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.740]   But here now we're asking people, you know,
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.020]   people are pushing for more representation.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.660]   They're asking to be represented within their workplace.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.020]   Be it Starbucks where baristas are, you know,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:34.500]   and other Starbucks employees are trying to unionize.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.700]   We have unions among our research assistants,
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.340]   the Brookings Institution where I am, you know,
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.460]   kind of teaching assistants and big universities
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.220]   are doing the same kind of thing as well
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.020]   because they want to have their voice heard.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.580]   They want to kind of play a larger role
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.660]   and they want to have change.
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.460]   And they're often pushing their companies
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.980]   or the institutions they work for to make that change
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:55.420]   because they don't see it happening in the political sphere.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.660]   So it's not just enough to go out there
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.860]   and protest in the street,
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.700]   but if you want something to happen,
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.420]   that's why you're seeing big corporations
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.060]   playing a bigger role as well.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.860]   - Yeah, and of course there's, you know,
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.980]   there's the longer discussion.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:10.380]   There's also criticisms of that mechanisms of unions
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.700]   to achieve the giving of a voice to a people.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.180]   This goes back to my own experience
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.220]   growing up in Northern England.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.020]   The Durham miners that I was part of for generations,
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.940]   you know, first person in my family,
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.740]   not in the mines on my dad's side,
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.900]   they created their own association.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.860]   It wasn't a union per se at the very beginning.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   Later they became part of the National Miners Union.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.420]   They lost their autonomy and independence
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.700]   as a result of that.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.140]   But what they did was they pooled their resources.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.300]   They set up their own parliament
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.380]   so they could all get together.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.860]   Literally they built a parliament
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.540]   and it opened in like the same time as World War I
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.420]   and where they all got together
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.260]   'cause they didn't have the vote.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.020]   They didn't have suffrage at the time
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.340]   because they didn't have any money, you know,
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.540]   so they couldn't pay the tax
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.660]   and they couldn't run for parliament.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.500]   And this is, you know,
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.100]   the kind of the origins of the organized labor parties later,
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.660]   but they create this association
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.420]   so they could talk about how they could deal with things
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.620]   with their own communities
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.740]   and have a voice in the things that mattered.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.460]   You know, education, improving their work conditions.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.740]   It wasn't like what you think about
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.580]   some kind of like big political trade union
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.380]   with, you know, left-wing, you know, kind of ideas.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.300]   In fact, they actually tried to root out later
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.420]   after the Bolshevik revolution in the Soviet Union,
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.620]   even when they were still having ties
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.780]   with players like the miners of Donbass in the 1920s,
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.820]   Trotskyites and, you know, kind of Leninists
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.540]   and, you know, communists.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.500]   They were more focused on how to improve
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.060]   their own wellbeing, you know,
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060]   what they called the welfare.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.740]   They had some welfare societies
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.900]   where they were kind of trying to think,
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.180]   and that's kind of what baristas in Starbucks want
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.540]   or workers in Amazon.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.820]   They're looking about their own wellbeing.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.620]   It's not just about pay and work conditions.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:47.140]   It's about what it means to be part of this larger entity
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.620]   because you're not feeling that same kind of connection
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.900]   to politics, you know, at the moment,
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.380]   because, you know, you're being told by a representative,
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.460]   "Sorry, I don't represent you
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.740]   "because you didn't vote for me."
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.780]   You know, if you're not a Democrat,
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.020]   you're not a Republican, you're not red,
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.700]   you know, you're not blue, you're not mine.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.380]   And so people are saying, "Well, I'm in this work class.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.180]   "This is kind of my collective.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.140]   "You know, this is, you know, therefore,
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.500]   "this is what I'm gonna have to try to push to make change."
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.060]   So, I mean, this is kind of happening here,
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.860]   and we have to, you know, realize that, you know,
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.380]   we've kind of gone in a way full circle
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.700]   back to that, you know, kind of period
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.260]   of the early emergence of sort of mass labor
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.540]   and, you know, that's where the political parties
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.420]   that we know today, and, you know,
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.580]   the kind of early unions came out of as well,
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.700]   this sort of feeling of a mass society,
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:33.020]   but where people weren't really able to get together
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.860]   and implement or push for change.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.900]   - You know, with unions at a small scale and a local scale,
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:43.940]   it's like every good idea on a small scale
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.580]   can become a bad idea on a large scale.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.420]   - On a large scale, yeah.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.220]   - So like marriage is a beautiful thing,
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.620]   but at a large scale,
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.980]   it becomes the marriage industrial complex
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.740]   that tries to make money off of it,
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.140]   combined with the lawyers
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.100]   that try to make money off the divorce.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.260]   It just becomes this caricature of a thing.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.980]   Or like Christmas and the holidays, it's like, it's just-
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.140]   - I don't disagree, but what I'm saying is
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.180]   there's people are basically looking for something here
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.700]   and, you know, kind of, this is why, I mean,
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.500]   I myself am starting to think about much more local,
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.220]   you know, kind of solutions for a lot of these,
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.140]   you know, kind of problems.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.220]   It's again, the teamed networked approach.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:26.100]   - On the impeachment, looking back,
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.860]   because you're part of it, you get to experience it,
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.580]   do you think they strengthened or weakened this nation?
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.820]   - I think it weakened in many respects,
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.020]   just the way that it was conducted.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.140]   I mean, there's a new book coming out
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.380]   by a couple of journalists in the Washington Post,
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.420]   I haven't actually seen it yet,
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.780]   but I really did, you know, kind of worry that,
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.820]   myself, that it became a spectacle.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:54.620]   And although it actually, I think, in many respects,
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.260]   was important in terms of an exercise
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.060]   of civic responsibility and, you know,
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.500]   gave people a big, massive lesson in civics,
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.540]   everyone's kind of running out
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:04.340]   and looking up the whole process of impeachment
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.180]   and what that meant,
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.700]   kind of like congressional prerogatives I was as well,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.340]   I was, you know, running off myself
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.660]   and trying to learn an enormous amount about it
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.260]   'cause I was in the middle of all of this,
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.260]   that it didn't ultimately show responsibility
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.260]   and accountability.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.980]   And that in itself was weakened
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:26.460]   because on both sides, there was a lot of partisan politics.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.740]   I mean, I think that there was a dereliction of duty
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.140]   in many respects.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.100]   I mean, especially, I have to say,
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.780]   on the part of Republican members of Congress,
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.700]   who were, you know, kind of,
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.740]   they should have been embracing, you know,
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.780]   Congress's prerogatives.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.940]   You could have, you know, kind of basically done this
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.980]   in something of a different way.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.980]   But the whole thing is because it was this larger atmosphere
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.540]   of polarized, well, not even polarized,
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.860]   but fractured politics.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.180]   And I was deeply disappointed, I have to say,
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.860]   in many of the members of Congress on the Republican side.
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:02.980]   I mean, there's a lot of grandstanding
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.540]   that I really didn't like one bit
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.660]   on the Democratic side either.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.540]   And not admitting to mistakes
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.100]   and, you know, not kind of addressing head-on,
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.620]   you know, the fact that they'd, you know,
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.100]   kind of been pushing for, you know,
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.300]   Trump to be impeached and, you know,
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.260]   talking about being an illegitimate president,
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.540]   you know, kind of right from the very beginning.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.980]   And that, you know, as a result of that,
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.100]   a lot of people just saw this
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.020]   as kind of a continuation of, you know,
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.700]   political games, you know,
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.660]   coming out of the 2016 election.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:31.060]   But on the Republican side, it was just a game.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.740]   There was people I knew who were, you know,
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.980]   basically, you know, at one point, one of them winked at me.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.500]   You know, in the middle of this, you know,
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.780]   kind of impeachment, it's just like,
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.820]   don't take this personally, you know, this is--
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.660]   - It's a game.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.500]   - This is a game.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.060]   And I just thought, this isn't a game.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.380]   And that's why I think that it, you know,
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.100]   kind of weakened because, I mean, again, on the outside,
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.980]   it weakened us, the whole process weakened us
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.260]   in the eyes of the world, because again,
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.380]   the United States was the gold standard.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.540]   And I do think, I mean, again,
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.500]   in the terms of the larger population,
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.300]   although a lot of people did actually see the system,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.060]   you know, standing up, trying to do something
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:04.900]   to hold people account,
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.540]   but there still was that element of circus
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.140]   and a big political game
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.900]   and people being careless with the country.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.380]   - But I do think that the Democrats
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.780]   were the instigators of the circus.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.660]   So as a, it's perhaps subtle,
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:26.340]   but there's a different way you talk about issues
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.020]   or concerns about accountability
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.620]   when you care about your country,
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.100]   when you love your country, when you love the ideals,
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.340]   and when you, versus when you just want to win.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.700]   - And stick it to the other side.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.540]   No, I agree. - Stick it to the other side.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.380]   - I agree.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.860]   I mean, there were people who I actually thought
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:46.620]   managed that, that made it about the country
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.820]   rather than about themselves.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.820]   - But I guess there's no incentive to do that.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.660]   - Yeah, there were a lot of others
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.100]   who did a lot of grandstanding.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.220]   And that's another problem
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.860]   of our political incentive structures,
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.580]   that the kind of sense of accountability
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.060]   and responsibility tends to be personal.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.140]   You know, whether people decide to do it or not.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.780]   It's not institutional, if that makes sense.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.500]   We've had a kind of a breakdown of that kind of, that sense.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.260]   Now I took an oath of office,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.500]   and I'm assuming that most of them did too.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.300]   You know, I had to be sworn in, you know,
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.700]   when I took those positions.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.540]   I took that seriously,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.900]   but I already took an oath of citizenship.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.420]   There's, you know, presumably you did too, you know.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.940]   You kind of started to become an American citizen.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.180]   It's not something you take on lightly.
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.220]   And, you know, that's why I felt
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.620]   this deep sense of responsibility all the time.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.180]   Which is why I went into the administration
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.020]   in the first place.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.820]   I mean, I got a lot of flack for it.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.180]   Because, you know, I thought, well, look, I've been asked,
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.140]   and there's a real issue here,
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.180]   after the Russian interference
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.180]   and, you know, the whole influence operation
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.540]   in the 2016 elections.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.700]   And I knew what was going on, and I should do something.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.500]   You know, if not me, then, you know, okay,
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.540]   someone else will go and do it.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.860]   But can I live with myself just sitting on the sidelines
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   and criticizing what people are doing?
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.780]   You know, and kind of worrying about this?
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.140]   Or am I actually going to muck in there
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.060]   and, you know, just go and do something?
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.740]   It's like seeing your house on fire.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:03.660]   And you see that, you know,
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.180]   okay, this is pretty awful and dangerous,
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.860]   but I could go in there and do something.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.220]   - To clarify, the house on fire,
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.900]   meaning the cyber war that's going on,
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.660]   or cyber attacks, or cyber security.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:16.940]   - Well, in the 2016, you know,
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.460]   when the Russians had interfered in the election.
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.100]   You know, I mean, basically,
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:25.140]   this was a huge national security crisis.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.780]   And our politics, we'd gone mad as a result of it.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.860]   And we, in fact, we were making the situation worse.
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.060]   And I felt that I could, you know, kind of,
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.060]   at the time, maybe I could do something here.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:36.140]   I could try to clarify.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.420]   I could, you know, work with others who I knew
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.180]   in the government from previous stints in the government
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.220]   to push back against this
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.500]   and try to make sure it didn't happen again.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.380]   And look, and I also didn't have this, you know,
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.980]   mad, you know, kind of crazy ideological view
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.820]   of Russia either.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.660]   I mean, I knew the place.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.220]   I knew the people had been sitting a long time
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.420]   and quite calm about it.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.060]   I don't take it personally.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.660]   It's not kind of an extension of self.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.340]   It's, you know, something I've spent a long time
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.540]   trying to understand for myself,
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.820]   going back to that very beginning
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.500]   of why were the Russians trying to blow us up?
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.620]   There must be an explanation.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.620]   There was, it was a very complicated and complex explanation.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:10.020]   It wasn't as simple as how it sounded.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:14.020]   And also, there's a long tail to 2016.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.340]   You know, Putin's perceptions,
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.700]   the kind of things that he thought were going on.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.940]   You know, the whole way that what they did
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.860]   was actually fairly straightforward.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.660]   They'd done this before in the Soviet period,
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:27.340]   during the Cold War, classic influence operation.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:30.260]   It just had gone beyond the bounds
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.620]   of anything they could have anticipated
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:32.780]   because of social media
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.020]   and just a confluence of circumstances
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.500]   in the United States as well.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.580]   We were very fragile and vulnerable.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.820]   And I remember at one point having a discussion
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.100]   with the Russian ambassador,
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.100]   where, you know, we were complaining
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.460]   about the Russian intervention.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.140]   He said, "Are you telling me that the United States
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.500]   "is a banana republic, that it's so vulnerable
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.820]   "to these kinds of efforts?"
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.020]   And he actually looked genuinely mystified.
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.700]   Although, you know, obviously it was probably,
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.220]   you know, part of a, you know,
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.340]   kind of political shtick there.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.860]   But he had a point.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.220]   The United States had never been that vulnerable
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.780]   as it suddenly was in 2016.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.420]   And in the time that I was in government,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:11.740]   and going back to what you asked about the whole impeachment
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:15.260]   and the whole exercise in Congress,
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.460]   that vulnerability was as stark as it, you know,
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.300]   ever could be.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.940]   Our domestic politics were as much a part of the problem
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.780]   as anything else.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.820]   They were the kindling to all of the kind of the fires.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.540]   Putin didn't start any of this,
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.420]   other kind of problems.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.660]   Domestically, he just took advantage of them.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.220]   And, you know, basically added a bit of an excellent
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.060]   here and there.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.980]   - Yeah, the interference.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   I mean, that's a much longer discussion
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:45.940]   'cause it's also for me, technically fascinating.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.460]   I've been playing with the idea of just launching
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.500]   like a million bots, but that are doing just positive stuff
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.340]   and just being kind to people.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.620]   - Yeah, I always kind of wonder if,
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.460]   is it possible to do something on this scale
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.300]   that's positive?
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.140]   Because, you know, a lot of people seem to be able
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.940]   to use all of this for pretty negative effect.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.260]   You've got to kind of hope that you could do this,
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.420]   use the same networks for positive effect.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.860]   - I think that's actually where a lot of the war,
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.340]   I think from the original hackers to today,
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.220]   what gives people like me,
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.500]   and I think a lot of people that,
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.780]   in the hacking community,
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.100]   the pleasure is to do something difficult,
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.100]   break through the systems and do the ethical thing.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.380]   So do the, because if there's something broken
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.500]   about the system, you want to break through all the rules
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.340]   and do something that you know in your heart
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.700]   is the right thing to do.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.460]   I mean, that's what Aaron Schwartz did
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.060]   with releasing journals and publications
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.260]   that were behind paywalls to the public
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.740]   and got arrested for it and then committed.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.300]   But to me, it's fascinating because I,
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.860]   maybe you can actually educate me,
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.220]   but I felt that the Russian interference
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:59.820]   in terms of social engineering,
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.220]   in terms of bots, all that kind of stuff,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.940]   I feel like that was more used for political bickering
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.700]   than to actually understand the national security problem.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.900]   Because I would like to know the actual numbers involved
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.740]   in the influence.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.220]   I would like to, I mean, obviously, hopefully,
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.340]   people now understand that better
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.980]   than are trying to defend the national security
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:21.860]   of this country.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:25.020]   But it's just, it felt like, for example,
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:30.020]   if I launch one bot and then just contact somebody
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:32.740]   at the New York Times saying, "I launched this one bot,"
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:37.740]   they'll just say, "MIT scientist hacks," you know?
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.620]   (Donna laughs)
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:42.060]   And then that, they'll spread.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.620]   - But that's exactly what happened.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.660]   It was, you know, kind of, I think that, you know,
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.940]   Putin and some of the people around him understood
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.660]   because, again, propaganda state,
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.340]   they spend an awful lot of time thinking about how you,
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.460]   you know, basically put out your own content
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.500]   and how you get maximum effect through performance.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.180]   Putin himself is a, you know,
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.260]   political performance artist.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.540]   I mean, Trump understood exactly the same thing.
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.100]   They were actually operating in parallel,
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.140]   not in collusion, but in parallel.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.660]   You know, basically, Trump understood
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.660]   how to get lots of free air time, you know,
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.020]   how to get himself at the center of attention.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.740]   Putin, you know, did that through a kind of,
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.300]   I think, a less organic kind of way.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.820]   You know, he had a lot of people working around him.
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.340]   I mean, that's the old, you know, Bolshevik agitprop
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.460]   and, you know, kind of then the whole
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:25.820]   Soviet propaganda machine.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.860]   And, you know, Putin kind of growing up
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:30.300]   in that kind of environment and having, you know,
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.580]   kind of the Kremlin press office
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.340]   and all the kind of people around him,
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.100]   got kind of a massive machine, knew how that worked.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.420]   I mean, they haven't done what the Chinese did in Russia,
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.780]   of like, you know, blocking everything
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.020]   and having a big firewall.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.420]   It was kind of putting out lots of content,
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.980]   getting into the, you know, the sort of center of attention.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.060]   Trump's doing the same kind of thing.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.540]   And the Russians understood that, you know,
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.460]   if you put a bit of things out there
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.340]   and then you call up the New York Times
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.860]   and people are going to run with it.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.340]   And what they wanted was the perception
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.500]   that they had actually swore the election.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.420]   They loved it.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.140]   This was the huge mistake of the Democrats and everything.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.100]   I mean, I kept trying to push against this.
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.140]   No, they did not elect Donald Trump.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.500]   Americans elected Donald Trump.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.540]   And, you know, the electoral college was a key part.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.660]   Vladimir Putin didn't make that up.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.460]   You know, and basically, I also remember, you know,
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.020]   at one point the Russian ambassador, you know,
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.380]   talking to me about when we were doing the standard,
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.500]   you know, here we are, we're lodging our complaint
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.780]   about the interference, you know, he basically said,
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:31.220]   well, we didn't, you know, kind of invent Comey.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.020]   And, you know, basically the, you know,
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.780]   the decision to reopen, you know, Hillary Clinton's emails
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.220]   or, you know, kind of Anthony Weiner
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.940]   and, you know, kind of his, you know,
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.380]   emails on his computer.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.980]   And I was like, yeah, he's right.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.580]   I mean, you know, there were plenty of things
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:53.220]   in our own system that created chaos and tipped the election.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.460]   Not, you know, kind of what the Russians did,
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.260]   but, you know, it's obviously easier to blame the Russians
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.700]   and blame yourself when, you know, things are kind of,
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.980]   or those random forces and those random factors.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:07.620]   Because people couldn't understand what had happened in 2016.
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.660]   There was no hanging chads like 2000,
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.060]   where there was, you know, kind of a technical problem
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.100]   that actually, you know, ended up with the intervention
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.580]   of the Supreme Court.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:18.180]   There was, you know, pure and simple,
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.020]   the electoral college at work
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   and a candidate that nobody had expected,
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.540]   including the Republicans in the primaries, you know,
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.860]   to end up getting kind of elected or put forward,
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.700]   you know, just from 2016, suddenly becoming the president.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.020]   And they needed a meta explanation.
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.340]   It was much better to say Vladimir Putin had done it
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.180]   and Vladimir Putin and, you know, the Kremlin guys
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.300]   were like, "Oh my God, yeah, fantastic.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.380]   Champagne, pop, pop, cocks popping.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.180]   This is great. Our chaos agent."
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.020]   They knew they hadn't done it,
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.020]   but they'd love to take credit for it.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.900]   And so, you know, the very fact that other people
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:53.500]   couldn't explain these complex dynamics to themselves,
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:58.060]   basically dovetails beautifully with Vladimir Putin's
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.180]   attempts to be the kind of the Kremlin gremlin in the system.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:03.580]   And he's, you know, basically was taking advantage
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.420]   of that forever more.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.300]   He wanted, you know, to basically try to work with us
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.140]   to cut through that.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.980]   And the thing is then, you know, people lost faith
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.700]   in the integrity of the election system
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.900]   because people were out there, you know,
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.740]   suggesting that the Russians had actually
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.580]   distorted the elections.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.420]   People had written books about that.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.460]   They said, you know, that they hacked the system
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:20.940]   when, you know, they were trying to hack our minds.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:23.660]   But again, we were the fertile soil for this.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.500]   I mean, we know this from Russian history,
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.140]   the role of the Bolsheviks, you know,
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:30.540]   the whole 1920s and 1930s with Stalin,
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.700]   the fellow travelers and the, you know, socialist,
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.020]   you know, international.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.780]   I mean, the Russians and the Soviets have been
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.060]   at this for years about kind of pulling, you know,
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.500]   kind of people along and into kind of a broader frame.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.260]   But it didn't mean that they were influencing,
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:50.180]   you know, directly the politics of countries,
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.020]   you know, writ large.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:52.580]   There were plenty of interventions.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.660]   It's just that we were somehow,
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.180]   it was a confluence of events, a perfect storm.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:00.100]   We were somehow exquisitely vulnerable
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.620]   because of things that we had done to ourselves.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.580]   It was what Americans were doing to themselves
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.460]   that was the issue.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.460]   - You think that's the bigger threat
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.260]   than large-scale bot armies?
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:14.180]   - Those can be a threat.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.380]   Obviously, they do have an impact,
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.580]   but it's how people process information.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.740]   It's kind of like the lack of critical thinking.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.820]   I'm just not on the internet to that extent.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.620]   I go looking for information.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.460]   I'm not on social media.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.500]   I'm in social media, but not by myself.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.140]   You know, I don't put myself out there.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.500]   I'm not, I haven't got a Twitter feed.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.340]   I haven't got a blog. - You don't have
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:32.180]   a Twitter one, yeah.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:33.500]   But there is a...
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.340]   - You have a fan club. - There's one called
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.180]   Fiona Hill's Cat.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.540]   I have all kinds of strange things.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.140]   It's Fiona Hill's Cat, which I kind of like.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:38.980]   Occasionally, I have people send things to me.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.540]   - You have so many fans.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.380]   It's hilarious.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.980]   - But what I try to do is just be really critical.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:45.820]   I mean, my mom sends me stuff,
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:46.940]   and I'm like, "What is this?"
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.260]   You know, kind of.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.460]   - Yeah.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.340]   - It's just, you know, your own mother
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.940]   can be as much of an agent of misinformation
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.660]   as, you know, Vladimir Putin.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.500]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.340]   - I mean, we're all, you know,
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.100]   kind of we all have to really think
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.140]   about what it is we're reading.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.500]   There's one thing from my childhood
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.100]   that was really important to me,
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.180]   and I always think every kid in school should have this.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.500]   My next-door neighbor,
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:14.020]   who was, he was actually very active in the Labour Party,
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.260]   and he was, you know, kind of really interested
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.100]   in the way that opinion, you know,
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.580]   shaped people's political views.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.420]   And he was Welsh.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.300]   He was a native Welsh speaker,
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.940]   so, you know, he was always trying to explore English
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.220]   and how, you know, there was kind of the reach of,
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.820]   you know, the English culture,
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.460]   and, you know, kind of how it was kind of shaping
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.340]   the way that people thought.
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.540]   And he used to read every single newspaper,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.820]   you know, from all the different spectrums,
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.460]   which was quite easy to do, you know,
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:36.540]   back in the '70s and '80s,
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.060]   'cause there weren't that many in the UK context.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.100]   And every Sunday, he would get
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.580]   all the different Sunday papers
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:44.340]   from all the different kind of ideological vantage points.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.020]   And then when I got to be a teenager,
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.660]   he'd invite me to look at them with him,
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:49.700]   'cause he was my godfather,
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.460]   and he was just an incredible guy,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.020]   and he was just super interesting,
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.900]   and, you know, kind of culturally, you know,
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.420]   an outsider, always kind of looking in.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.620]   And he basically ran through, you know,
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.780]   what "The Guardian" looked at,
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.980]   "The Observer," "The Daily Mail," "The Sun,"
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.100]   you know, kind of all of these, you know,
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.500]   "The Telegraph," all of these newspapers,
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.460]   and how you could tell, you know,
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.580]   their different vantage points.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.700]   And, of course, it's complicated to do that now.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:13.860]   I mean, in this, you know,
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:17.420]   incredibly extensive media space.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.340]   I look at what it is that they're saying,
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.540]   and then I try to, you know, read around it,
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.540]   and then, you know, look at what other people are saying,
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.300]   and why they're saying it, and who are they,
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.860]   what's their context.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.740]   And that was kind of basically
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.020]   what I was taught to look at.
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.260]   And I think everybody should have that.
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.180]   - And certainly that's something that people in politics
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.260]   that are in charge of directing policy should be doing.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:39.100]   - They should be.
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.660]   - Not getting lost in the,
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:45.900]   in the sort of the hysteria that can be created.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.220]   It does seem that the American system somehow,
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.180]   not the political system, just humans, love drama.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.620]   A very good, like the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.740]   There's always like one, two, three stories somehow
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.740]   that we just pick, that we're just gonna,
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:08.740]   this is the stuff we're gonna fight about for this election.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.100]   - And everyone's got an opinion on it.
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.580]   Everybody. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:14.780]   - And it's the most, like Hillary Clinton's emails,
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.100]   the Russians hacked the election.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.300]   - Yeah, we had John Podesta's pasta recipes for a while,
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.180]   you know, that we were kind of all obsessing over.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:22.740]   I don't know, people running out and trying them out,
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:23.580]   you know, something like that.
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.100]   - And there's fun, I mean, there's all,
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:30.260]   there's the best conspiracy theories about Giuliani.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.100]   I just love it.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.180]   We just pick a random story.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.540]   Sometimes it's ridiculous.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.820]   - And it detracts from what the larger question should be,
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.740]   which is about the family members of, you know,
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.900]   senior officials and whether they should be anywhere near
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.140]   any of the issues that they're, you know,
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.500]   there's ethics, there's government ethics and things there,
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.540]   you know, kind of across the board.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.820]   But there's a bigger story in there,
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.380]   but that becomes a distraction.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:51.260]   It's a look over there, you know,
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.900]   the oldest trick in the book, you know, kind of idea.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.020]   - Yes, given- - And politicians
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.820]   are really good at that because it detracts
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:59.940]   from the larger question because every single member
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.780]   of Congress and, you know, government official,
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.980]   their family should be nowhere near anything they're doing.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:09.020]   - Well, that I could push back and disagree on.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.260]   I mean, I understand- - Well, it depends
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.100]   on what they do, if they're making money out of it,
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.020]   you know, and kind of basically being in business
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.740]   is what I mean, you know, kind of this is an issue.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:19.980]   So it's not, you know, Hunter Biden on his own.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.740]   It's, you know, kind of basically the kids of, you know,
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.180]   the Trump family, you name it.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.540]   - Yeah, in general like that, I just think it's funny.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:33.060]   Like, there's a lot of families that, you know,
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.300]   they work very closely together, do business together,
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.700]   and it's very successful.
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.820]   I get very weird about that.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:42.140]   It just feels like you're not, in fact,
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:47.140]   I don't even like hiring or working with friends initially.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   You make friends with the people you work with, but-
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.700]   - That's right, no, I have the same worries as well
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.140]   because in the kind of clouds, you know,
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.220]   I would encourage, you know, my daughter
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.140]   to do something completely different.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.660]   - Right. - Not go into the same field.
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.620]   Now, look, it's different if you're, you know,
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.620]   in science or, you know, mathematics or something like this,
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:04.820]   and, you know, maybe, you know, kind of,
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.220]   you've got a family, maybe you're kind of building
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:08.260]   on some of their theories and ideas, you know.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.500]   If Albert Einstein had a, you know, kind of an offspring
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.180]   who was in mathematics and took, you know,
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.940]   father's thinking, you know, further,
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.460]   that would be very different.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:18.180]   But if it's, you know, kind of you're in business
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.100]   and other things, and it's just, you know,
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.700]   it's the nepotism problem that no one has there.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.460]   - Well, science has that too, in the space of ideas.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.300]   - Yeah, well, they do.
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.140]   If they're not, people aren't coming in
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.380]   and building on the ideas in a constructive way.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:31.420]   - Right, but even for son, daughter of Einstein,
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:34.860]   you wanna think outside the box of the previous.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:35.940]   - Yeah, well, that's what I'm meaning,
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.540]   but I mean, it's just, but they shouldn't be sort of told,
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:40.140]   no, sorry, you can't go and study math 'cause, you know,
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.180]   whatever, physics, you know, because of.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.220]   - But a lot of that, you can't actually make it into law.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.580]   Well, you could, I suppose, but honestly,
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.100]   if you do that kind of thing,
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.220]   you should be transparent.
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.060]   There should be just an honesty about it.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:52.820]   - It gets back to what I was talking about
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.180]   before, we need diversity of views
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.180]   and diversity of thinking, and you can't have other things.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.140]   It's like being partisan or, you know,
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.180]   rooting just for a team.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.780]   You know, if something's gonna cloud your judgment
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.140]   or constrain the way you think about things
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:09.180]   and become, you know, kind of a barrier to moving on out.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.060]   And look, that's what we see in the system around Putin.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.980]   It's kind of kleptocratic, and it's, you know,
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:16.460]   it's filled with nepotism.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.060]   All of the kind of like the people
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.540]   who you kind of see out there
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.020]   in prominent positions are the sons or daughters of,
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.620]   including Putin himself.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:26.180]   I mean, that's when a system has degenerated.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.180]   And that's, you know, kind of,
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.580]   and I suppose in a way,
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.540]   this is a symbol of the degeneration of the system,
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.420]   but again, it's just a diversion from, you know,
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.820]   kind of the bigger issues and bigger implications
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.460]   of things that we're discussing.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:42.860]   - So critics on the left often use the straw man of TDS,
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.340]   Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.380]   Why does Donald Trump arouse so much emotion in people?
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:53.980]   - It's just the nature of the person.
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:57.060]   I mean, I don't feel particularly emotional about him.
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:01.060]   I mean, he's kind of a, he's a very flawed guy,
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.020]   to be honest, and this may seem bizarre,
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.580]   I felt sorry for him,
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.860]   because this guy is so vulnerable,
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.100]   so wrapped up in himself,
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:15.100]   that, I mean, he's just exquisitely open to manipulation.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.780]   And I saw people taking advantage of him all the time,
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.260]   and he has zero self-awareness.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.300]   I mean, I kept thinking to myself,
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.780]   my God, if this guy didn't have this entourage around him,
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.900]   how would he function?
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.260]   I mean, I felt sorry for us as well,
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:28.620]   I mean, that he ended up being our president,
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:29.900]   'cause that should not have happened,
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.540]   I mean, in terms of character,
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.260]   and in terms of fit for the job.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.260]   Although I saw this, you know,
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.620]   kind of over a period of time,
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.620]   but I didn't feel, you know, kind of any,
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:45.620]   you know, sense of derangement, you know,
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.460]   kind of around him.
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.900]   He didn't drive me nuts in that way,
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.940]   I just became, I was just very worried about,
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.300]   you know, the kind of the impact that he was having
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.380]   on many particular issues.
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.820]   - Here's the important thing,
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.740]   so what I noticed with people that criticize Donald Trump
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:05.300]   is they get caught up in the momentum of it,
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:06.900]   and they're unable to see,
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.740]   first of all, let's start with some ground truth,
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.740]   which is approximately half the country voted for the guy,
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.540]   right?
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:23.660]   - Yep, and more voted in 2020 than voted in 2016 for him.
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.500]   Yep.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:28.140]   - And I just feel like people don't load that in
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:28.980]   when they're honestly criticizing.
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:32.940]   - And a lot of those people didn't vote for him
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.780]   and his personality, and often could,
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.020]   because I know a lot of people that voted for him,
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.260]   first time and second time,
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:42.900]   and they could disassociate, you know,
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.900]   kind of all of the kind of features of Donald Trump
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.020]   that drives other people nuts from, you know,
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.540]   what they thought that an actual fact he could achieve
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.300]   in terms of, and it wasn't just this kind of sense about,
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.260]   well, I couldn't possibly vote for Democrats.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:58.100]   Sometimes it's just like, well, look, he shakes things up
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.660]   and we need things to shake, to be shoken up and--
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.900]   - Some people might've voted for him for personality.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.740]   See, this is what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.180]   - Yeah, some of them did as well,
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:06.900]   but I'm just saying that not all of them did either.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.500]   - We don't know that data, that's the thing.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.220]   - But yeah, I can't say I'm just saying anecdotally,
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.340]   I know people have voted for him because he's him,
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:16.220]   from the charisma and others who voted
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.980]   because he's shaking things up
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:20.940]   and, you know, he's keeping people on their toes
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.540]   and, you know, kind of, we need that, you know, idea.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:28.740]   - But the way to avoid Trump Derangement Syndrome, to me,
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:32.300]   me as a doctor, I'm sort of prescribing to the patients
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:36.060]   on this syndrome, this issue,
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.700]   is I feel like you have to empathize with the people.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.180]   Well, you have to imagine in your mind
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.580]   all the different, like, strengths
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:49.460]   that the people who have voted for Donald Trump see
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:52.540]   and really understand it, really feel it,
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.580]   like walk around with it and then criticize.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.860]   Like, I just feel like people get lost
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.860]   in this bubble of criticism, in their own head.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:03.160]   Forget like the tribe you're in or whatever,
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.460]   in their own head, they're not able to see,
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.380]   like half this country that we're a part of
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:11.540]   voted for the person, same with Biden.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.860]   Half the country voted for the guy.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.580]   The people that are criticizing Biden
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.860]   and they're doing this,
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:20.460]   the way Biden is currently criticized
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.900]   is not based on policy.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:27.900]   It's based on personal stuff similar like to Trump.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:28.740]   - Yeah, I know it is.
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:29.700]   I mean, that's what people don't look.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:33.020]   I think part of that is, I mean, look, first of all,
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.500]   I want to say I completely agree with you
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.380]   about understanding where people are coming from.
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:37.660]   And I think it's very important for people
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.900]   to listen to other people and their views.
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.660]   I try to do that all the time, try to learn from that.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.340]   You know, I mean, everybody's got a perspective
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.180]   and a context.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.300]   We all live in a certain context.
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.780]   We're all living in history, our own personal histories,
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.940]   matter a lot, and also the larger context
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:53.820]   and environment in which we're living in
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:56.580]   and where we live and who we live with.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.580]   And, you know, the kinds of lives that we lead as well,
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:00.260]   those are all extraordinarily important.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:02.020]   I mean, I know that from myself.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.780]   Everything that I've done in my life
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:05.540]   has been shaped by where I came from,
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.980]   who I was, my family, and the way that we looked at things.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.860]   You can't take yourself out of that.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.500]   I mean, you can do it in some, you know,
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.780]   like a science or something else,
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.260]   but, you know, it's still your own views
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.940]   and maybe some of the ideas that you have.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.700]   And pursuing an experiment might have been shaped
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.620]   by your larger context, you know,
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.380]   depending on what it is that you work on.
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:24.700]   But the other thing is the nature of the political system.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:29.060]   The presidential election is like a personality contest,
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.420]   a beauty contest.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.540]   It's like a kind of a referendum on, you know,
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:34.380]   one person or another.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.980]   It's kind of like what we see in Russia, honestly,
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.220]   with, you know, Putin or not Putin,
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.580]   or Putin and Putin before.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.700]   You know, it's all about Putin.
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.180]   And, you know, what do you think about Putin?
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.020]   It's all about what the president should be doing
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.100]   and, you know, kind of what their policies are.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:51.300]   That's kind of the bizarreness of the US political system.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.700]   Look, we've just seen this happening in the United Kingdom.
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.940]   You've got this core of a couple of thousand,
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.460]   couple of hundred thousand, rather,
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:58.660]   people in the Conservative Party
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:03.020]   who've just voted for, you know, three leaders in a row.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.860]   The rest of the country isn't.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.820]   And they're just looking at, you know,
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.220]   whether they like that personality
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.260]   and, you know, what they say to them
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.420]   rather than what they're necessarily
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.140]   going to do for the country.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.100]   I mean, which is, you know, kind of pretty absurd.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.420]   And again, the presidency is a weird hybrid
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:17.300]   in the United States.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.620]   You know, we were talking before about,
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.260]   it's the person who should be running the country.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.420]   It's the chief executive or the prime minister
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.300]   in another setting.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.140]   But we don't think of it like that.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.780]   You know, we often think about whether we like the guy
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:27.620]   or not, or, you know,
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.580]   we'd like to hang out with him or the, you know,
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:31.180]   one of my younger relatives.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.620]   And I said, "So why did you vote for Trump?"
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.460]   He said, "Well, he was great.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.300]   "He was funny.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.140]   "I went to his rallies.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.980]   "I got, you know, all kind of charged up."
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.900]   And I said, "Could you see yourself voting for Biden?"
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:39.740]   "No, he's too old."
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.620]   And I said, "Well, you know, he's only just a little bit,
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.260]   "you know, kind of older than Trump."
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:46.260]   Or he's, you know, the same age as your grandma.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.260]   Do you think your grandma's older?
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.100]   "Oh, no, not at all."
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.220]   But it's just this kind of perception.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.380]   He's boring, you know?
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.820]   So there's, people are actually sometimes, you know,
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.340]   basically being, you know,
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.380]   kind of motivated by just a feeling, you know,
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.460]   kind of that kind of sense,
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.540]   because that's the sort of nature of the, you know,
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.380]   the presidency.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.380]   It's this kind of how you feel about yourself as an American
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.100]   or how you feel about the country at large,
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:07.820]   the kind of the symbol of the state.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:08.780]   Look, you know, in Britain,
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.900]   you had Queen Elizabeth II and everybody, you know,
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:14.060]   seemed to, for the most part, not everyone, I guess,
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.900]   but most people respected her as a person,
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.780]   as a personality, as a kind of symbol of the state,
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.500]   even if they actually didn't really like
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.060]   the institution of the monarchy.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:22.900]   There was something, you know,
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.820]   kind of about that particular personality
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.660]   that you were able to, you know,
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.140]   kind of relate to in that context.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.300]   But in the United States,
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.500]   we've got all of that rolled into one,
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.260]   the head of state, the symbol of the state,
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.540]   the kind of queen, the king, the kind of idea,
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.140]   the chief executive, the kind of prime ministerial role,
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.220]   and then the commander in chief of the military.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.580]   It's all things, you know, kind of at once,
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:43.940]   but ultimately for a lot of people,
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.820]   it's just how we feel about that person.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.460]   Oh, I couldn't go vote for them because of this,
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.460]   or I couldn't vote for them because of that.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.820]   And in 2016, you know,
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.620]   Hillary Clinton actually did win the election
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.260]   in terms of the popular vote.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.300]   So it wasn't that, you know,
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.020]   kind of people wouldn't vote for a woman.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.780]   I mean, more people voted for her on the popular level,
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.060]   not obviously, you know, through the electoral college
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.140]   in the electoral college vote.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.100]   So it wasn't just, you know, gender or something like that,
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.420]   but it was an awful lot of things
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.900]   for people who found Trump attractive,
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.940]   because he was sticking up the big middle finger
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.220]   to the establishment.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:17.540]   He's an anti-establishment change character.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.540]   There was a lot of people voted for Barack Obama
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.260]   for the same reason and voted for Trump.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.060]   We know that phenomenon, what was it, 11,
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:25.140]   you know, 12% of people, you know,
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.060]   so they could vote for some completely,
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.420]   totally different, radically different people
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:32.260]   because of that sort of sense of change and charisma.
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.100]   I mean, I had people who I knew voted for Trump,
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.020]   but would have voted for Obama again if he'd run again,
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.620]   because they just liked the way that he spoke,
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:42.540]   they liked the way that, you know, 'cause they said,
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.340]   I mean, this is all my own anecdotal things,
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.980]   but one of my relatives said,
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:47.740]   "I could listen to Obama all day, every day.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.380]   I just love the way he sounded.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.340]   I love the way he looked."
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.220]   You know, I just like the whole thing about him.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.260]   And then to say about Trump, well, he was exciting.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.100]   He was interesting.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.140]   You know, he was kind of like, you know,
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:57.380]   whipping it up there.
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.900]   You know, so there's this, just this kind of feeling.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:01.060]   You know, we always say about, you know,
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.140]   could you have a beer with this person?
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.140]   And people decide they couldn't have one
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.540]   with Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.260]   And, you know, maybe they could go off
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.260]   and have one with Barack Obama and with Donald Trump.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:15.420]   They didn't want to have one with Joe Biden,
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:16.660]   you know, for example.
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.300]   And remember, George W. Bush didn't drink,
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.580]   so he wouldn't have had a beer with him.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.020]   He'd have gone out and got a soda or something with him.
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.540]   But, you know, there's this,
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.180]   there's that kind of element
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.780]   of just that sort of personal connection
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:31.260]   in the way that the whole presidential election is set up.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.700]   It's less about the parties.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.860]   It's less about the platforms,
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.420]   and it's more about the person.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:39.940]   - Yeah, and picking one side
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.460]   and like sticking with your person.
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.260]   It really like a support team.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.780]   - Yeah, it is, yeah.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:47.540]   - What do you think about Vladimir Putin,
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.980]   the man and the leader?
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.060]   Let's actually look at the full,
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.820]   you've written a lot about him,
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:55.580]   the recent Vladimir Putin
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.820]   and the full context of his life.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:04.140]   Let's zoom out and look at the last 20 plus years
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:04.980]   of his rule.
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:08.780]   In what ways has he been good for Russia?
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.140]   In what ways bad?
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:14.580]   - Well, if you look to the first couple of terms
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.780]   of his presidency,
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:20.180]   I think, you know, on the overall ledger,
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.020]   he would have actually said
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.700]   that he made a lot of achievements from Russia.
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.900]   Now, there was, of course,
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:28.420]   the pretty black period of the war in Chechnya,
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.900]   but, you know, he didn't start that.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.780]   That was Boris Yeltsin.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:36.140]   That was obviously a pretty catastrophic event.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.700]   But if you look at then other parts of the ledger
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.300]   of what Putin was doing,
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:43.180]   you know, from the 2000s, you know, onwards,
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.220]   he stabilized the Russian economy,
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.340]   brought back, you know, kind of confidence
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:52.340]   in the Russian economy and financial system.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:56.260]   He built up a pretty impressive team of technocrats
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.180]   for everything, the central bank and the economics
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.660]   and finance ministries,
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.700]   who, you know, really got the country back into shape again
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:06.820]   and solvent, paid off all of the debts,
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.060]   and, you know, really started to build the country
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.100]   back up again domestically.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.500]   And, you know, the first couple of terms,
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.100]   again, putting Chechnya, you know, to one side,
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.340]   which was a little hard because, I mean,
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.060]   there was quite a lot of atrocities.
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.020]   And I have to say that, you know,
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:23.300]   he was pretty involved in all of that
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:26.260]   because the FSB, which he'd headed previously,
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.300]   you know, was in charge of wrapping up Chechnya,
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.620]   and it created, you know,
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:32.460]   kind of a very strange sort of system of fealty,
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.020]   almost a feudal system,
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.860]   and the kind of relationship between Putin at the top
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.060]   and Kadyrov in Chechnya.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.620]   And there was quite a lot of distortions,
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.940]   you know, kind of as a result of that
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.140]   in the way that the Russian Federation was run.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.900]   You know, a lot more of an emphasis
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.380]   on the security services, for example,
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.860]   but there was a lot of pragmatism,
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:52.020]   you know, opening up the country for business,
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.980]   you know, basically extending our relationships.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.820]   I would say that, you know,
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.620]   by the end of those first couple of terms of Putin,
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.540]   Russians were living their best lives.
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:06.340]   You know, there was a lot of opportunity for people.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:09.220]   People's labor, you know, was being paid for.
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.340]   They weren't being taxed.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:13.140]   The taxes were coming out of the extractive industries.
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:15.940]   There was, you know, kind of, I guess,
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.460]   a sense of much more political pluralism,
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.180]   but it wasn't the kind of the chaos of the Eltsin period.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.060]   And then you see a shift.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:26.500]   And it's pretty much when he comes back into power again
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.220]   in 2011, 2012,
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.180]   and that's when we see kind of a different phase emerging.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:34.260]   And, you know, part of it
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:37.100]   is the larger international environment
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.540]   where Putin himself has become kind of convinced
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.980]   that the United States is out to get him.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.900]   And part of it goes back to the decision
[01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.740]   on the part of the United States to invade Iraq in 2003.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:49.540]   There's also, you know,
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.780]   the recognition of Kosovo in 2008,
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.540]   and, you know, the whole kind of machinations
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:55.740]   around all kinds of, you know,
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:58.100]   other issues of NATO expansion and elsewhere.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.340]   But Iraq in 2003,
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:02.060]   and this kind of whole idea after that,
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.620]   that the United States is in the business of regime change,
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:07.900]   and perhaps, you know, has him in his crosshairs as well.
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.580]   But there's also then kind of, I think,
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.860]   a sense of building crisis
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:16.180]   after the financial crisis and the Great Recession,
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.740]   2008, 2009,
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.500]   because I think Putin up until then believed in,
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500]   you know, the whole idea of the global financial system
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.180]   and that Russia was prospering,
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.220]   and that Russia, you know, part of the G8
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.020]   and actually could be genuinely one of the, you know,
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.660]   the major economic and financial powers.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.500]   And then suddenly he realizes
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.020]   that in the West is incompetent,
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.260]   that, you know, we totally mismanaged the economy
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.780]   of our own, the financial crash in the United States,
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:46.940]   the kind of blowing up of the housing bubble,
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.900]   and that we were feckless,
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.020]   and that that had global reverberations.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.420]   And he's prime minister, of course,
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.300]   you know, in this kind of period.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:56.140]   But then, you know,
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.420]   and I think that that kind of compels him
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.020]   to kind of come back into the presidency
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.780]   and try to kind of take things under control again
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:03.140]   in 2011, 2012.
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.660]   And after that, he goes into kind of a much more
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.140]   sort of focused role where he sees the United States
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:10.540]   as a bigger problem.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:14.500]   And he also, you know, starts to, you know,
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:18.060]   kind of focus on also the domestic environment,
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.460]   because his return to the presidency is met by protests.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.060]   And he genuinely seems to believe,
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:25.460]   because again, this is very similar to belief here
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.740]   in the United States that Donald Trump
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:28.220]   couldn't possibly be elected by Americans,
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:31.300]   that somehow there was some kind of external interference,
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.660]   because the Russians interfered and had an impact.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.700]   Putin himself thinks at that time,
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.980]   it's one of the reasons why he interferes
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:38.100]   in our elections later,
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.580]   that the United States and others had interfered,
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.180]   because he knew that people weren't that thrilled
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:43.380]   about him coming back.
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:46.020]   They kind of liked the Medvedev period.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.060]   And the protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.460]   and other major cities,
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:52.460]   he starts to believe are instigated by the West,
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:54.580]   by the outside, because of, you know,
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.700]   funding for transparency in elections
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:00.980]   and, you know, all of the NGOs and others,
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.940]   you know, they're operating,
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.180]   State Department, embassy funding,
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.660]   you know, and, you know,
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.500]   the whole attitude of, "God, he's back,"
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.980]   you know, kind of thing.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:09.820]   And so after that,
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:12.660]   we see Putin going on a very different footing.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:16.820]   It's also somewhere in that period, 2011, 2012,
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.620]   we start to kind of obsess about Ukraine.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:20.820]   And he's always, you know, I think,
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:23.060]   been kind of steeped in that whole view of Russian history.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.100]   I mean, I heard at that time, I was in,
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.020]   I've written about this in many of the things that,
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.580]   you know, I've written about Putin,
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.060]   that in that same timeframe,
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.620]   I'm going to all these conferences in Russia
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:35.460]   where Putin is and Peskov, his press secretary,
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.740]   and they talk about him reading Russian history.
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.980]   I think it's this, in this kind of period,
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.740]   that he formulates this idea
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:46.700]   of the necessity of reconstituting the Russian world,
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.580]   the Russian empire.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.180]   He's obviously been very interested in this.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.420]   He's always said, of course,
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.700]   that the collapse of the Soviet Union
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.100]   was the great catastrophe of the 20th century,
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.940]   but also the collapse of the Russian empire before it.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.380]   And he starts to be critical about Lenin and the Bolsheviks,
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:02.300]   and he starts to do all this talking about Ukraine
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.860]   as the same country,
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.940]   Ukrainians and Russians being one and the same.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:09.260]   And this is where the ledger flips,
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.620]   because, I mean, the initial question you asked me
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:14.380]   is about, well, has Putin been good for Russia or not?
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:17.500]   And this is where we get into the focal point of,
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:20.180]   or the point where he's not focusing
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:23.820]   on the prosperity and stability and future of Russia,
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.740]   but he starts to obsess about the past
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.420]   and start to take things in a very different direction.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.100]   He starts to clamp down at home
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:35.060]   because of the rise of opposition
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.620]   and the fact that he knows that his brand
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.340]   is not the same as it was before,
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.660]   and his popularity is not the same as it was before,
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.700]   because he's already gone over that period
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:49.580]   in anybody's professional and political life
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.860]   that if you stay around long enough,
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.740]   people get a bit sick of you.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.940]   It's just, we talked about that before.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.660]   Should you stay kind of in any job
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.820]   for a long period of time, you need refreshing.
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:00.540]   And Putin is starting to look like
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.500]   he's going to be there forever,
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.540]   and people are not happy about that,
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.660]   and would like the chance as well to move on and move up,
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.180]   and with him in still in place,
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:11.140]   that's not going to be particularly possible.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.740]   And that's around the time when he starts
[01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:14.660]   to make that decision of annexing Crimea,
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:18.140]   and that's when the whole thing flips, in my view.
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:22.820]   The annexation of Crimea in 2014 is the beginning of the end
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   of Vladimir Putin being a positive force within Russia,
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:31.740]   because if you pay very close attention
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:36.740]   to his speech on the annexation of Crimea in March of 2014,
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:41.700]   you see all of the foreshadowing of where we are now.
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.460]   It's already of kind of his view of kind of his obsessions,
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.780]   his historical obsessions, his view of himself
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:48.380]   as being kind of fused with the state,
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.860]   a kind of a modern czar,
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.740]   and his idea that the West is out to get him,
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.100]   and it becomes after that,
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.940]   almost a kind of like a messianic mission,
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.380]   to turn things in a different direction.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:03.100]   - And who are the key people to you
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:08.100]   in this evolution of the human being of the leader?
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:10.220]   Is it Petr Shchev?
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:12.140]   Is it Shoygu, the Minister of Defense?
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:15.380]   Is it, like you mentioned, Peskov, the Press Secretary?
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:19.260]   What role do some of the others like Lavrov play?
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.100]   - I think it's more rooted in the larger context.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:22.900]   I mean, individuals matter in that context,
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:25.500]   but it's just kind of like this shared worldview.
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.220]   And if you go back to the early 1990s,
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:29.380]   immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:34.380]   when Yeltsin and his counterparts in Ukraine, Belarus,
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:36.500]   pull it apart, there was an awful lot of people
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:40.620]   who wanted to maintain the Soviet Union, not just Putin.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.980]   I mean, you remember after Gorbachev
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:47.500]   tried to have the new union treaty in 1991,
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.580]   and there was the emergency committee set up,
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.220]   the coup against Gorbachev.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.100]   It was because they were worrying he was going too far
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.780]   and unraveling the union then as well.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.220]   They were opposed to his reforms.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.620]   There's always been a kind of a very strong
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.060]   nationalist contingent that become Russian nationalists
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.900]   over time rather than Soviet hardliners,
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.860]   who basically want to maintain the empire,
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.700]   the union in some form.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.900]   And in the very early part of the 1990s,
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.780]   there was a lot of pressure put on Ukraine
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:18.020]   and all the other former Soviet republics,
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.060]   now independent states, by people around,
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:24.260]   Mayor Lushkov, for example, in Moscow,
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:26.940]   by other forces in the Russian Duma,
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.820]   not just Vladimir Zhirinovsky and others,
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:32.500]   but really serious, kind of what we would call here,
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.140]   like right-wing nationalist forces.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:38.420]   But it's pervasive in the system,
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:41.060]   and it's especially pervasive in the KGB
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:42.940]   and in the security sector.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.340]   And that's where Putin comes out of.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.620]   Remember Putin also was of the opinion
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.780]   that one of the biggest mistakes the Bolsheviks made
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:53.300]   was getting rid of the Orthodox Church
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.460]   as an instrument of the state.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.900]   And so there's this kind of restorationist wing
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:01.420]   within the security services and the state apparatus
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.940]   that want to kind of bring back Russian Orthodoxy
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:07.060]   as a state instrument, an instrument of state power.
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.980]   And they were kind of looking all the time
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.980]   about strengthening the state,
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.780]   the executive, the presidency.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.820]   And so it's everybody who takes part in that.
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:19.900]   And it's also others who want power, honestly,
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:22.660]   and they see Putin as their vehicle for power.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.220]   I think people like Sergei Kiryanko,
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:26.500]   I knew Kiryanko back in the '90s.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.140]   I mean, my God, that guy's all in.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.220]   Or like Dmitry Medvedev,
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.540]   you know, who was a warmer, fuzzier version of Putin,
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.980]   certainly had a totally different perspective,
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:35.820]   wasn't in the KGB.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.660]   - Did you say warmer, fuzzier version?
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.700]   - A warmer, fuzzier version, yeah.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:39.660]   I mean, he's kind of like,
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.700]   he was literally a warm personality.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:42.660]   I don't know if you watched him
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.380]   during the September 30th annexation,
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.420]   the guy had all kinds of facial twitches
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:47.980]   and looked so rigid and stiff
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.580]   that he looks like he might implode.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:53.580]   I mean, that wasn't how he was earlier in his career.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:56.180]   And he had a different view of Perestroika.
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:58.660]   We always have to remember that Putin was not in Russia
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.500]   during Perestroika, he was in Dresden,
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:04.380]   watching the East German state fall apart.
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.940]   And dealing with the Stasi
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:07.460]   and in a kind of place where
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.820]   you weren't getting a lot of information
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.300]   about what was happening in West Germany
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.140]   or even what was happening back home in Perestroika.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.380]   And he has that kind of group of people around him,
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:18.220]   the Patrushevs and Botnikovs and others,
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.740]   and Sergei Ivanov and others,
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:25.460]   from the different configurations of his administration,
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.940]   who have come out of that same kind of mindset
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.140]   and are kind of wanting to put everything
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.100]   back together again.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.300]   So there's a lot of enablers,
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.260]   there's a lot of power seekers,
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.700]   and there are a lot of people who
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.700]   think the same as him as well.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.660]   He is a man of his times, a man of his context.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:47.300]   - You as a top advisor yourself and a scholar of Putin,
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:51.580]   do you think, actually now in his inner circle,
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.980]   are there people he trusts?
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:55.300]   - There are people he trusts for some things,
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.980]   but I don't think there's people he trusts for everything.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.820]   I don't think he's the kind of person
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.260]   who tells anyone everything at all.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.500]   I don't think he's got somebody who deeply confides in.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:06.220]   No, I think he compartmentalizes things.
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.900]   He's often said that the only person he trusts is himself.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:09.900]   And I think that's probably true.
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:12.100]   He's the kind of person who keeps his own counsel.
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:14.860]   I mean, people talk about Kovalchuk, for example,
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:18.540]   or some of the other people who are friends with him
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:21.900]   that go back to his time in St. Petersburg.
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:25.340]   At various points, he seemed to spend a lot of time,
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:28.100]   way back when, talking to people who are,
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.100]   people think of kind of more moderating forces
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.220]   like Alexei Kudrin,
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:35.060]   but doesn't seem to be interacting with them.
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:37.220]   There are obviously aspects of his personal life.
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.300]   Does he speak to his daughters?
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:45.140]   Does he speak to kind of lovers,
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:48.060]   kind of in a way people speculate about,
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:49.380]   who might he confide in?
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:50.300]   But I would greatly doubt
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.340]   that he would have deep political discussions with them.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:57.420]   He's a very guarded, very careful person.
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.580]   - What about sources of information then?
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:03.860]   So trust a deep understanding about military strategies
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.620]   for certain conflicts, like the war in Ukraine,
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:13.420]   or even special subsets of the war in Ukraine,
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.940]   or any kind of military operations,
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.780]   getting clear information?
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:20.060]   - I think he's deeply suspicious of people
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.660]   and of information.
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:26.540]   And I think part of the problems
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.780]   that we see with Putin now,
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:32.700]   I mean, I've come from isolation during COVID.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.460]   I'm really convinced that, like many of us,
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:39.660]   a lot of Putin's views have hardened.
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.780]   And the way that he looks at the world
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:45.260]   have been shadowed in very dark ways
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.900]   by the experience of this pandemic.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:50.220]   Obviously, he was in a bubble,
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.780]   different kind of bubble from most of us.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:53.180]   I mean, most of us are not in bubbles
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.500]   with multiple kind of palaces and kind of the Kremlin.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.260]   But we've seen so much,
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.140]   obviously a lot of this is staged, that isolation,
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.180]   or they're kind of making it very clear
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.180]   that he's the czar,
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.620]   the guy who is in charge, making all the decisions,
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:09.500]   one end of the table and everybody else is at the other end.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.380]   But it's very difficult then to bring information to him
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:14.220]   in that way.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.020]   He used to have a lot of information bundled for him
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:19.140]   in the old days by the presidential administration.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.020]   I mean, I know that because it was a lot more open
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:21.860]   in the past.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:23.060]   And I've had a lot of meetings
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:25.220]   with people in the presidential administration
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.460]   who brought outside,
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:29.060]   would say all source information for him,
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:32.860]   kind of funneled in information from different think tanks
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:35.380]   and different viewpoints
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:38.420]   and maybe a kind of more eclectic,
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.340]   diversified set of information.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.660]   He would meet with people.
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:42.740]   You've heard all the stories
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:45.980]   about where he had once called up Masha Gessen
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:47.500]   and had to come in.
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:50.460]   Obviously, a very different character
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.940]   as a journalist and a critic.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:55.780]   We've heard about Benediktor from Ekho Moskvy,
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:58.580]   the radio program, the editor,
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:02.260]   who Putin would talk to and consult with.
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.620]   He'd reach out.
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:07.100]   People like Lyudmila Alexeeva, for example,
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.260]   the head of Memorial, he had some respect for her
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:12.460]   and would sometimes just talk to her, for example.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:15.100]   All of that seems to have come to a halt.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.860]   - Can you explain why?
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.220]   - I think a lot of us worry,
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:20.140]   I mean, us who watch Putin,
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.700]   about what kind of information is he getting?
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:24.460]   Is it just information that he's seeking
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:25.540]   and gathering himself
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.660]   that fits into his worldview and his framework?
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:30.140]   We're all guilty of that, of looking for things.
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:32.580]   It gets to our social media preferences.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:33.980]   Are people just bringing to him things
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.300]   that they think he wants to hear?
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:36.700]   Like the algorithm,
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.540]   kind of like the Kremlin working in that regard.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:42.220]   Or is he himself tapping into a source of information
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.780]   that he absolutely wants?
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:46.980]   And remember, he is not a military guy.
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:49.660]   He's an operative and he was sort of trained in operations
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.340]   and contingency planning.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.900]   Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister,
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:54.900]   as a civil engineer,
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.940]   was the former minister of emergencies.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.500]   He wasn't a military planner.
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.540]   You know, somebody like Gerasimov,
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:04.660]   the head of the chiefs of staff,
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:08.180]   maybe a military guy, in this case, from the army,
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:10.380]   but he's also somebody who's in a different part,
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:11.220]   the chain of command.
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:14.260]   He's not somebody who would spontaneously start
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.420]   telling Putin things.
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:18.780]   And Putin comes out of the FSB,
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:21.380]   out of the KGB of the Soviet era,
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.100]   and he knows the way that intelligence
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:24.100]   get filtered and works.
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:24.940]   He's probably somebody who wants
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:26.460]   to consume raw intelligence.
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:30.020]   He doesn't probably want to hear anybody else's analysis.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:34.020]   And he's thrived in the past of picking things up from people.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.780]   You know, I've taken part in all of these meetings
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.620]   with him, gone for hours,
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.980]   'cause he's just collecting.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.220]   He's collecting information.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.460]   He's sussing people out.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.260]   He wants to know the questions they ask.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:44.540]   He learns something about the questions that people ask,
[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:46.180]   the way that they ask them.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:48.820]   You know, so he's kind of soliciting information himself.
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:51.420]   And if he's cut off from that information,
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:53.660]   you know, because of circumstances,
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:56.540]   then, you know, how is he formulating things in his head?
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:59.340]   And again, getting into, you can't get into his head,
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.340]   but you can understand the context in which he's operating.
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:03.260]   And that's where you worry,
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:06.780]   because he clearly made this decision to invade Ukraine
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.500]   behind the back of most of his security establishment.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.500]   - You think so?
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.260]   - Oh, I think it's pretty apparent.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:18.700]   - Oh, what, what would the security establishment,
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:19.540]   what would be the--
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.420]   - Well, that would be the larger, you know,
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:21.940]   thinking of the funneling in information
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.020]   from the presidential administration,
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.660]   from the National Security Council.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:26.500]   It looks like, you know,
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.380]   he made that decision with a handful of people.
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.220]   And then, you know,
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.140]   having worked in these kinds of environments,
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:32.580]   and it's not that dissimilar,
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.540]   you filter information up.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.700]   So think about, you know,
[01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:37.580]   you and I are talking for hours here.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:41.980]   If you were my, you know, basically,
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.420]   you know, senior official, and I'm your briefer,
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.900]   I might only get 20 minutes with you.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:49.140]   And you might be just like, you know,
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:51.060]   looking at your watch the whole time and thinking,
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.260]   hang on a second, I've got to go,
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.140]   and I've got this meeting, and I've got that meeting.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:56.780]   And yeah, your point, you're not going to wait there.
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.860]   So I give this long explanation,
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.060]   I've got to get to the point.
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.220]   And then I've got to then choose for myself,
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:04.380]   what's the information I'm going to impart to you?
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.260]   Out of the 20 things that I think are important,
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.780]   you know, okay, I've got 20 minutes,
[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:10.500]   maybe I only get two minutes.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.860]   Maybe, you know, you get called out,
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.220]   and somebody, you know, kind of interrupts,
[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:18.260]   something happens, I'm going to get one minute, two minutes.
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.300]   I mean, I once remember,
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:21.340]   I had to give a presentation when I was in government.
[01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:22.180]   - It's too real.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:23.900]   - You know, to Henry Kissinger,
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.140]   you know, for that defense policy board.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.380]   And we planned bloody weeks on this thing.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.300]   You know, PowerPoints were created,
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:32.740]   teams of people were brought together.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.580]   And, you know, people were practicing this,
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:36.740]   we had all these, you know, different people there.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.220]   And I said, look, Henry Kissinger's an academic
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:40.980]   and a former professor, and, you know,
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.420]   I happened to, you know, I've got to watch him in action.
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.820]   He's going to like, you know, five seconds in,
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.740]   if we're lucky we get that far,
[01:59:48.740 --> 01:59:49.740]   ask us a question,
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:51.700]   and just throw off our entire presentation.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.940]   What is it that we want to convey?
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.540]   And that's exactly what happened.
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:56.420]   And then, you know, people aren't really prepared
[01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:57.380]   what they wanted to convey.
[01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:59.700]   And they, you know, they prepared a, you know,
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:02.900]   a nice sort of fulsome, you know, PowerPoint-like approach.
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.540]   We never even got there.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:05.820]   And so God knows what, you know,
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:07.420]   he took away from it at the end of it.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.300]   And that's, you know, think about Putin.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:11.340]   He's going to be kind of impatient.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.700]   He's, you know, we see the televised things where he,
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:15.980]   you know, kind of sits at a table a bit like, you know,
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.860]   people won't necessarily see us here.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.100]   And he puts his hands on the table
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.620]   and he looks across at the person and he says,
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:23.700]   "So, tell me, you know,
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.060]   what's the main things I need to know?"
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:27.500]   And of course the person's mind probably goes blank,
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.620]   you know, with the kind of the thought of like,
[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:31.300]   oh God, what's the main thing?
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.140]   And they go, and they start,
[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:33.620]   well, Vladimir Vladimirovich.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:36.420]   And, you know, they start the kind of, you know,
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:38.380]   they're revving up, you know, to get to the point,
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.700]   and then he cuts them off.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:41.020]   So you think about that,
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:41.860]   and then you think about,
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:43.700]   well, what information has he got?
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.540]   And then how does he process it?
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:47.020]   And is he suspicious of it?
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:48.180]   Does he not believe it?
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.860]   And what inside of his own history then, you know,
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:53.860]   leads him to make one judgment over another?
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:55.820]   He clearly thought the Ukrainians
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.460]   would fall apart in five seconds.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:00.260]   - We don't know if he clearly thought that,
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:04.900]   but that there was a high probability maybe?
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:05.940]   I mean, you can guess.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.340]   - I think he pretty much thought it,
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:08.820]   because I think he thought that, you know,
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.020]   kind of his Zelensky wasn't very popular.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.100]   There was an awful lot of, you know, pro-Russian sentiment
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.740]   in whatever way he thinks that is,
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:17.580]   because people are Russian speakers,
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:19.500]   and that, you know, they're kind of, you know,
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:22.820]   in polling, you know, they expressed affinity with Russia.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:25.100]   I mean, certainly in Crimea,
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:27.980]   that worked out because a majority of the population
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.260]   had, you know, higher sentiments
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:32.460]   or feelings of affinity with Russia.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.060]   And, you know, obviously, you know,
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:36.300]   that kind of, they got traction there.
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:37.300]   But it's more complicated.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:38.580]   We talked about Donbass before,
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.220]   about being a kind of melting pot,
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:43.140]   when, you know, they tried the same thing in Donbass,
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:43.980]   Donetsk and Luhansk,
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.460]   'cause they tried in Crimea in 2014,
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.540]   it didn't kind of pan out.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:49.460]   In fact, you know, a whole war broke out.
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.260]   They tried, you know, to kind of in,
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:54.140]   you know, many of the major cities
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.220]   that are now under attack, including Odessa,
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:58.900]   to kind of foment, you know, pro-Russian movements,
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:01.380]   and they completely and utterly fell apart.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:03.380]   So Putin was thinking,
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:05.180]   you know, I'm pretty sure based on polling
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.860]   and the FSB having infiltrated, you know,
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:10.180]   an awful lot of the Ukrainian hierarchies
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.660]   we're now seeing is quite apparent
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:14.140]   with some of the dismissals in Ukraine.
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.340]   He was pretty sure that, you know,
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:19.100]   kind of he would get traction,
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.660]   and that it would be like 1956 in Hungary
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.260]   or 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:26.500]   Remember, he comes out of the Andropov levy,
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:28.740]   as it's called, the kind of cohort of people
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:32.220]   who come into the KGB under Yuri Andropov,
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:33.660]   and Yuri Andropov has presided
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.100]   over a lot of these anti-dissident,
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.180]   you know, kind of movements inside of Russia itself
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.300]   and how you suppress opposition,
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:43.100]   but also over, you know, how you deal with,
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.700]   you know, kind of the uprisings in,
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:47.700]   you know, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.380]   And there's all these lessons from this that,
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:51.820]   you know, you can put everything back in the box.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:53.140]   And yeah, there might be a bit of violence
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.020]   and a bit of fighting, but ultimately,
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.900]   you think you've got the political figures
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:58.780]   and you decapitate the opposition.
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:01.980]   So they thought Zelensky would run away,
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:04.260]   Yadokovich ran away, but, you know,
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:05.740]   that was kind of a bit, you know,
[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:08.580]   sort of a different set of circumstances.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.540]   And they thought that all of the local governments
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:11.900]   would, you know, kind of capitulate
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.580]   because they had enough Russians
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.260]   and inverted commas in there.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:19.020]   Again, mistaking language and, you know,
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.700]   kind of positive affinity towards Russia for identity
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:23.700]   or how people would react in the time
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:25.900]   and not understanding people's, you know,
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:29.060]   linkages and, you know, kind of importance of place,
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.180]   the way that people feel about who they are
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:34.180]   in a certain set of circumstances and place.
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:38.420]   - But the invasion of Ukraine in 2022
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:43.420]   is unlike anything that he was ever involved with.
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.900]   - I don't think he thought it would be, you know,
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:48.260]   because it's this kind of, if he looks back into the past,
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:52.340]   you're right though, he wasn't involved in '68 or '56
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.340]   or what happened in the 1980s in Poland.
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:57.620]   - But there's a very wide front and it's the capital.
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:00.220]   And I mean, this isn't going for-
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:01.980]   - This isn't Chechnya or this isn't, you know,
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.820]   kind of Syria or, for example, yeah.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:05.140]   - This is a major nation.
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:05.980]   - Exactly.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:08.060]   - Like a large, it's large, the size.
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:09.420]   - It was more like Afghanistan,
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:11.500]   but they didn't realize that because again,
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:12.700]   Ukrainians are us.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:15.740]   There's this kind of inability to think
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.820]   that people might think differently
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.780]   and might want something different.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.980]   And that 30 years of independence
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.380]   actually has an impact on people and their psyches.
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:27.300]   And if I look back to the 1990s,
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.900]   I mean, I remember being in seminars
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:30.500]   and at Harvard at the time,
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:33.700]   and we were doing a lot of research on, you know,
[02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:35.980]   what was happening in, you know,
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:37.540]   the former Soviet Union at the time,
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:38.700]   because the early 1990s,
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.380]   just after the, you know, the whole place fell apart.
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:43.540]   And there was already under Yeltsin,
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:46.300]   this kind of idea of Russians abroad,
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:48.180]   Russians in the near abroad, Russian speakers,
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.940]   and the need to bring them back in.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:53.020]   And I remember, you know, we had seminars at the time
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.900]   where we talked about at some point,
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.420]   there'd be some people in Russia
[02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:58.020]   that would actually believe that
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:01.500]   those Russian speakers needed to be brought back into Russia,
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.540]   but that the people who spoke Russian might have moved on
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.460]   because they suddenly had other opportunities
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:08.100]   and other windows on the world.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.540]   I mean, look what's happened in Scotland.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:13.540]   You know, for example, most people in Scotland speak English.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:17.340]   The Scottish language is not the standard bearer
[02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:18.540]   of Scottish identity.
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:20.740]   There's just, it's almost a civic identity,
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.100]   different identity than not just national identity,
[02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:24.740]   just like you see in Ukraine.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:26.180]   And there's lots of English people
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.140]   that have moved to Scotland
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.460]   and now think of themselves as Scottish,
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:29.940]   or Brazilians or Italians,
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:32.420]   and, you know, all kinds of people who've moved in there.
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:33.660]   I mean, it's a smaller population,
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:36.020]   obviously, and it's not the scale of Ukraine,
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.580]   but, you know, people feel differently.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.620]   And there's been a devolution of power.
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.860]   And when Brexit happened, you know,
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.700]   Scotland didn't want to go along with that at all.
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:47.620]   They wanted to kind of still be, you know,
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:49.700]   having a window on Europe.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:51.260]   And that's kind of historic.
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:54.860]   And lots of people in Ukraine have looked West, not East.
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:56.340]   You know, it depends on where you are,
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:59.980]   not just in Lviv, you know, or somewhere like that,
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:01.060]   but also in Kiev.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.300]   And Kharkiv, you know,
[02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.740]   was kind of predominantly a Russian-speaking city,
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:08.500]   but Kharkiv was also the center of Ukrainian culture
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:11.060]   and Ukrainian literature, you know, at different points.
[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:12.540]   People have different views.
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.580]   I grew up in the North of England.
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:15.060]   We don't feel like the South of England.
[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:16.580]   There's been a massive divide
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:19.300]   between North and South in England for millennia,
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:20.740]   not just centuries.
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.940]   So, you know, people feel differently
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:24.460]   depending on where they live and, you know,
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.620]   kind of where they grew up.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:28.060]   And Putin just didn't see that.
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:28.900]   He didn't see that.
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:29.980]   - Well, hold on a second.
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:33.660]   Let me sort of push back at the fact
[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.100]   that I don't think any of this is obvious.
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:39.980]   So first of all, Zelensky before the war was unpopular.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:42.140]   - Oh, he was, what was it, 38%, something like that?
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:44.620]   But best in the popularity, yeah.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.540]   - Let me sort of make the case
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:50.900]   that the calculation here is very difficult.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.100]   If you were to poll every citizen of Ukraine
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:58.420]   and ask them, "What do you think happens if Russia invades?"
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:03.380]   Just like, actually, put each individual Ukrainian
[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:05.100]   in a one-on-one meeting with Putin
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.300]   and say, "What do you think happens?"
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.300]   I honestly think most of them will say,
[02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:12.660]   they will agree with the prediction
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:15.140]   that the government will flee, it would collapse,
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:20.140]   and the country won't unite around the cause
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.820]   because of the factions,
[02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:23.740]   because of all the different parties involved,
[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:24.580]   because of the unpopularity of the president.
[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:27.740]   - You might have said the same thing about the Soviet Union
[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:31.100]   when Hitler invaded in 1941.
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.340]   - You see, the problem is Putin always reads history
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.340]   from one perspective over another.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:41.340]   I think most countries basically rise to their own defense.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:44.140]   So this is actually one of the first times
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:46.700]   that Russia has been on the offensive
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.180]   rather than on the defensive.
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:52.580]   So there's kind of a bit of a flip there.
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:55.020]   I mean, obviously Afghanistan,
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:56.460]   but that was more complicated
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:58.460]   'cause it was also supposed to be an intervention, right?
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:08:00.740]   I mean, it wasn't supposed to be to annex Afghanistan.
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:03.740]   It was to try to prop up,
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.100]   kind of a reinstall a leader there.
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:11.860]   Syria, you were in there to help your guy, Bashar al-Assad,
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:13.420]   turn away the opposition.
[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:15.220]   Chechnya was a debacle.
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:18.780]   The Chechens fought back big time.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:23.780]   And it was only by dint of horrible, violent persistence
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:28.620]   and ruthlessness and nasty, dirty tricks
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:31.580]   that Putin prevailed there.
[02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:33.540]   But then you wonder, did he prevail?
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:35.380]   Because what happened?
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:37.780]   Chechnya sometimes describes the most independent part
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:38.700]   of the Russian Federation.
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:42.620]   And Ramzan Kadyrov plays power games in Moscow.
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:44.580]   Yeah, his predecessors,
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:47.420]   even his father and others wouldn't have done that.
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:51.260]   Ahmed Kadyrov, and before that, Dudayev and Maskhadov.
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.020]   I mean, they were willing to make a compromise,
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:56.820]   but they wouldn't have had the same position
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:58.860]   that Kadyrov has had.
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:01.780]   So, I think that, again, it's your perspective
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.220]   and where you stand and which bit of history
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:05.100]   you start to read.
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:07.940]   And that's why I said that, I think Putin,
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.100]   it's again, it's the information,
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:10.700]   the way that he processes it.
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.860]   I think most Russians also can't believe
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:14.820]   that they've done something wrong in Ukraine.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.700]   I mean, maybe at this point things are changing a bit,
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:21.220]   but that's why there was so much kind of support for this
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.060]   in a right way.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:22.900]   I mean, I have Russian friends again,
[02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:25.060]   I said, but look what was happening in Donetsk.
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:28.340]   Look what was the Ukrainians were doing to our guys.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:31.980]   Look what was happening to Russian speakers.
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:34.140]   We were defenders.
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:37.380]   We were not, we're not invaders.
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:40.100]   I think, again, the special military operation idea.
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.820]   Now I think it's flipping, obviously,
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.420]   in the way that with the war going on there.
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:47.500]   But Putin wasn't kind of looking at what would happen.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:51.540]   I mean, most of the kind of glory parts of Russian history,
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.180]   when you kind of go in,
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.380]   you chase Napoleon back to Paris,
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.620]   or you chase the Germans back to Berlin,
[02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.740]   you put the flag above the Reichstag.
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.500]   That's a very different set of affairs.
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.940]   When you've been fighting a defensive one,
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:07.780]   you've been invaded from a war where you invade someone else.
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:12.660]   And even the most fractured populations,
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:14.340]   like you had in the Soviet Union at the point,
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:18.100]   rally around and, you know, World War I, that fell apart.
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:20.940]   I mean, the Tsar didn't manage to rally everybody around.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:24.060]   I mean, the whole thing fell apart.
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:28.740]   And World War II, Stalin had to, you know, revive nationalism,
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:32.500]   including in the republics in Central Asia and elsewhere,
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:33.860]   to revive nationalism.
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:37.500]   And Ukraine suddenly found nationalism,
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.580]   you know, in a kind of sense of--
[02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:41.540]   - That's really interesting, because it's not obvious,
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:46.060]   especially what Ukrainians went through in the 1930s.
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:48.380]   It's not obvious that that, I mean,
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.260]   my grandfather was Ukrainian,
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:55.260]   and he was proud to fight a Ukrainian Jew.
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:11:00.260]   He was proud to fight and willing to die for his country.
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:01.660]   It wasn't like--
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.380]   - His country then was the Soviet Union.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.500]   - The Soviet Union, right.
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:05.340]   Sorry, to clarify.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:08.020]   - But he might fight now for his country, Ukraine.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:12.860]   - Yes, but I'm just like lingering on the point you made.
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:17.820]   It was not obvious that that united feeling would be there.
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.020]   - No, and again, it wouldn't have been obvious
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.300]   with the Soviet Union.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:22.140]   - That's what, sorry.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.180]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:24.580]   - Sorry, I was referring to my grandfather
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:25.420]   with the Soviet Union.
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:26.740]   We're both saying the exact same thing.
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:27.580]   - Yeah, we know, yeah, we are.
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:28.860]   We're saying the same thing. - You're saying it's a really
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:30.700]   powerful thing, 'cause I take it,
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:33.300]   'cause you take history as it happened,
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:35.300]   you don't realize it could have happened differently.
[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:37.260]   It's kind of, it's fascinating.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:38.780]   - It's that whole counterfactual, right?
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.620]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:40.980]   Because I mean, if you've kind of,
[02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:43.180]   that's why we all need in the United States
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:45.740]   to really examine our own history,
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:48.780]   because, you know, there's a lot of lessons from that,
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:51.260]   that we should treat very cautiously.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:53.660]   It doesn't mean that history repeats or even rhymes,
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:56.300]   you know, it's the old axiom all the time,
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:58.260]   but there are a lot of things
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:11:59.980]   that you can take away differently
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:03.300]   from putting a different perspective
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.380]   in a different slant on the same set of events.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:06.500]   I mean, I always used to wonder, like,
[02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:08.580]   how many books can be written on the French Revolution,
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:10.100]   or even on the Russian Revolution?
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:11.700]   You know, I studied with Richard Pipes.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:12.980]   I remember he was really offended
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:14.620]   after he'd written his great "Magnus Opus"
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:16.020]   on the Russian Revolution, two volumes,
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.380]   that other people would, you know,
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:18.620]   kind of write about the Russian Revolution.
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:19.500]   He said, "I've written it all."
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.900]   And I thought, well, actually, maybe you haven't.
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.380]   It's like, that might be some completely different angle there
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:26.420]   that you haven't really thought of, and that's Putin.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.260]   You know, I remember Peskov saying,
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:30.460]   "Putin reads history all the time, Russian history,"
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.740]   and I thought, well, maybe he should read some world history.
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:34.460]   You know, maybe he should, you know,
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:38.140]   kind of read some European authors on Russian history,
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:41.460]   not just, you know, reading Lamanossa for, you know,
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:44.060]   Russian historians on Russian history,
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:45.180]   because you might see something
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:46.740]   from a very different perspective.
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:47.580]   And look, in the United States,
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:50.900]   the United States made a massive mistake in Vietnam, right?
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:53.100]   I mean, they saw Vietnam as kind of weak,
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:56.260]   manipulated by, you know, kind of external forces,
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:12:58.260]   China, Soviet Union,
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:01.340]   but the Vietnamese fought for their own country.
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.620]   They suddenly became Vietnamese,
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.580]   and Ho Chi Minh became, you know,
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:09.260]   kind of basically a kind of a wartime fighter and leader,
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.380]   you know, in a way that, you know,
[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:13.140]   perhaps people wouldn't have understood either.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.500]   - You said the United States
[02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:17.860]   made a massive mistake in Vietnam,
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:21.660]   and that, for some reason, sprung a thought in my head.
[02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.860]   Has the United States, since World War II,
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:28.020]   had anything that's not a mistake
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:32.020]   in terms of military operations abroad?
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:37.140]   I suppose all the ones that are successes,
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.060]   we don't even know about, probably,
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:42.100]   so it's like very fast military operations.
[02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.300]   - I mean, Korea's divided.
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:44.620]   I mean, I don't know if it's successful,
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:46.020]   but, you know, kind of, I mean,
[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:48.020]   there was a solution found that, you know,
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:49.380]   some people are promoting, you know,
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:51.220]   in this case as well, of a sort of division,
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:53.900]   and, you know, the DMZ, and, you know,
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:55.100]   one side over the other,
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:56.860]   and, you know, kind of perpetuating a division,
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.140]   which I think is particularly successful.
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:01.500]   But if you think about World War I and World War II,
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.980]   the United States came in, you know,
[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.420]   under some very specific sets of circumstances.
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:07.900]   In World War I, they did kind of come in
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:10.580]   to help, you know, kind of liberate, you know,
[02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.340]   parts of Europe, France, and, you know,
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:15.060]   kind of the UK, and, you know, everything else,
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.780]   Great Britain, and the war towards the end of it.
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.460]   World War II, you know, there was that whole debate
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.540]   about whether the United States
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.380]   should even be part of the war.
[02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:25.580]   I mean, we know it wasn't thought to, you know,
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:27.660]   overturn the Holocaust, and all of the kind of things
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:29.660]   you'd kind of wish it would have been fought for,
[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:30.900]   but it was because of Pearl Harbor,
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.900]   and, you know, the Japanese pulling in.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:37.220]   But, I mean, ultimately, it was easy to explain
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.260]   why you were there, you know,
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:40.500]   particularly after Pearl Harbor and what had happened.
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:42.380]   It was harder to explain Vietnam and Korea,
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:43.620]   and, you know, many of the other wars,
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:45.420]   and that's kind of going to be a problem for Putin,
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:47.380]   and that's why there is a problem for Putin.
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:51.820]   All of his explanations have been questioned,
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:54.020]   you know, sort of off on NATO, or this,
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:56.260]   or that, or the other, and, you know,
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:59.380]   kind of liberating, you know, Ukraine from Nazis,
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:01.500]   or, you know, kind of basically stopping
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.500]   the persecution of Russian speakers,
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.940]   and all of this has now got lost
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:08.820]   in just this horrific destruction.
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:11.460]   And that's what happened in Vietnam, as well.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:15.500]   It became, you know, a great degradation
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.540]   of the Russian military, with atrocities
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:19.380]   and people wondering why on earth
[02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:22.100]   the United States was in Vietnam.
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:23.860]   I mean, even that kind of happened in Britain
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.260]   in their colonial, you know, kind of period, as well.
[02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:28.980]   Why was the United Kingdom doing, you know,
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:30.300]   committing atrocities and, you know,
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:33.100]   kind of basically fighting these colonial wars?
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:36.020]   Northern Ireland, why was the United Kingdom
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:41.020]   still, you know, kind of militarily occupying Ireland?
[02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:42.460]   Cyprus, there's all kinds of, you know,
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:43.820]   instances where we look at this thing,
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.420]   because what Russia is doing now,
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:49.260]   Putin is trying to occupy another country,
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:52.300]   irrespective of, you know, kind of the historical linkages,
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:54.700]   and, you know, the kind of the larger meta-narratives
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:56.580]   that he's trying to put forward there.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:02.100]   - What role did the United States play
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:05.180]   in the lead-up and the actual invasion
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:09.220]   of Ukraine by Russia?
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.460]   A lot of people say that, I mean,
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:16.380]   obviously Vladimir Putin says that part of the reason
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:19.940]   the invasion had to happen is because of security concerns
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:22.100]   over the expansion of NATO,
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:26.220]   and there is a lot of people that say
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:29.260]   that this was provoked by NATO.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.340]   Do you think there's some legitimacy to that case?
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:34.380]   - Look, I think the whole situation here
[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.060]   is very complicated, and you have to take
[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:37.500]   a much longer view than, you know,
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:39.540]   what happened in, you know, 2008
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:41.620]   with the opened door for Ukraine and Georgia,
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:42.460]   which actually, by the way,
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.020]   I thought was a strategic blunder, just to be very clear,
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.340]   because there wasn't any kind of thinking through
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:48.420]   about what the implications of that would be,
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:49.540]   and, you know, what it actually would mean
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:52.460]   for Ukraine's security, and also bearing in mind
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:53.900]   what, you know, Putin had already said
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:57.220]   about NATO expansion, they came on the wake
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:59.260]   of the recognition by the United States
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.100]   pretty unilaterally of Kosovo,
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:02.460]   and it also comes in the wake,
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:04.740]   as I mentioned before, the invasion of Iraq,
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:08.700]   which really is very important
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:11.460]   for understanding Putin's psyche.
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:13.060]   So I think, you know, we have to go back,
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:15.100]   you know, much further than it's not just talking
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:18.140]   about kind of NATO and what that means.
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:21.500]   NATO is part of the whole package of Ukraine
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.740]   going in a different direction from Russia,
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.140]   just as so is the European Union.
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:29.940]   Remember, the annexation of Crimea comes after Ukraine
[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:32.020]   has sought an association agreement
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:34.660]   with the European Union, not with NATO
[02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:36.380]   at that particular point, even though, you know,
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:39.380]   the EU on the security, common security and defence policy
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:44.660]   basically has all kinds of connections with NATO,
[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:45.700]   you know, various different levels
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:46.860]   in the European security front.
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:50.300]   It was all about Europe, and going on a different economic
[02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:53.220]   and political and ultimately legal path,
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:56.460]   because if you have an association agreement,
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:17:58.500]   eventually you get into the acquis communitaire,
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:00.300]   and it just transforms the country completely,
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:03.340]   and Ukraine is no longer the Ukraine of the Soviet period
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:04.700]   or the Russian Empire period.
[02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:06.980]   It becomes, you know, on a different trajectory
[02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:11.980]   like Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, you know,
[02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:14.580]   another country, it becomes a different place.
[02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:17.380]   It moves into a different space, and that's part of it.
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.380]   But if you go back again to the period
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:22.700]   at the very beginning of the 1990s,
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:25.740]   after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:27.820]   where there's no discussion about NATO at that point
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:30.860]   and NATO enlargement, there was a lot of pressure again,
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:33.620]   as I've said before, by nationalist elements on Ukraine,
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:35.540]   trying to bring it back in the fold,
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.900]   and wanting to make what was then, you know,
[02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:41.380]   this mechanism for divorce, more of a mechanism
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.980]   for re-managed Commonwealth of Independent States.
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:49.780]   And in the early 1990s, when Ukraine
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:51.460]   became an independent state, it inherited
[02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:54.500]   that nuclear arsenal from the Soviet Union.
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:57.180]   Basically, whatever was stationed or positioned
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:19:00.380]   in Ukrainian territory at the time became Ukraine's,
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:02.940]   strategic and, you know, kind of basically intermediate
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:04.780]   and tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:06.660]   And, you know, in the United States at the time,
[02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:08.900]   you know, we had all this panic about
[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:10.020]   what was gonna happen with all of that.
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:11.620]   So, I mean, I think, you know, as a scientist
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:13.220]   and, you know, kind of technically,
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:15.740]   it would have been difficult for Ukraine to actually use this.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:18.620]   I mean, the targeting was, you know, done centrally.
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:20.860]   They were actually stationed there, but nonetheless,
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:22.500]   Ukraine, like Belarus and Kazakhstan,
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:24.500]   suddenly became nuclear powers.
[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:28.380]   And, you know, Ash Carter, the former US defense secretary
[02:19:28.380 --> 02:19:32.460]   who's just died tragically, and Dave was talking about,
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:35.620]   you know, talking together today,
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:39.580]   was part of a whole team of Americans and others who,
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:41.820]   you know, tried to work with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:44.500]   to get them to give up the nuclear weapons.
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:50.500]   And back in the early period of that, '93, '94,
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:52.420]   you go back, and I mean, I was writing about this
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.700]   at the time, I wrote a report called
[02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:55.340]   "Back in the USSR," which is, you know,
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.020]   kind of on the website of the Kennedy School
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:58.380]   with some other colleagues.
[02:19:58.380 --> 02:20:01.740]   And we were monitoring how there was all these accusations
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:04.980]   coming out of Moscow, the defense ministry
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:07.060]   and the Duma, the parliament and others,
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:10.060]   that Ukraine was trying to find a way of making a dirty bomb,
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:13.220]   using its nuclear weapons, you know, becoming a menace,
[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.540]   and, you know, kind of Ukraine
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:16.780]   might have to be brought to order.
[02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:18.300]   So a lot of the dynamics we're seeing now
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:21.420]   were happening then, irrespective of NATO.
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.700]   Basically, the problem was always Ukraine getting away.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:28.260]   Yeltsin himself, when he unraveled the Soviet Union,
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:29.940]   didn't really want it to unravel,
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:31.820]   but he didn't have the wherewithal to bring,
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:32.780]   you know, the countries back again.
[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:35.500]   Russia was weak after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.580]   Its economy imploded.
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:39.300]   It had to give sovereignty to all of these
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:42.020]   constituent parts of the Russian Federation
[02:20:42.020 --> 02:20:43.740]   in terms of a sort of devolution of authority.
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:44.980]   It had the war in Chechnya,
[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:49.500]   which Yeltsin stupidly sparked off in 1994.
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:51.700]   You had Tatarstan, one of the regions,
[02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:53.700]   the all-rich regions, you know,
[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:58.660]   basically resting out a kind of a bilateral treaty with Moscow.
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:00.220]   You had the whole place was kind of seemed like
[02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:01.900]   it was falling apart so that, you know,
[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:03.900]   you couldn't do anything on Ukraine
[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:05.580]   because you didn't have the wherewithal to do it.
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:07.780]   And then when, you know, kind of basically Russia
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:10.340]   starts to get its act back together again,
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:14.340]   all of these security nationalist types
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:16.780]   who had never wanted Ukraine or Belarus or Moldova
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:18.340]   or anywhere else to kind of move away,
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.340]   they didn't worry that much about Central Asia, to be frank,
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:22.140]   but they did want, you know,
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.220]   the core states in their view to come back.
[02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:27.500]   And Moldova was part of that, even if it's not Slavic.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:30.900]   But, you know, they wanted Belarus and northern Kazakhstan
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:32.260]   and probably Kazakhstan as well,
[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:34.340]   which wasn't really thought about being part of Central Asia,
[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:36.860]   back in the fold as close as possible.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:41.620]   So anything that gave those countries an alternative
[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:43.460]   was seen as negative.
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:46.940]   And it could have been an association with China,
[02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:48.500]   you know, of them joining, you know,
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.260]   kind of an association with Latin America or Africa
[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:52.340]   or something else like that.
[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.780]   But of course, NATO has all of those larger connotations
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:58.980]   of it being, you know, the Cold War opposing entity.
[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:01.340]   And Putin has always seen NATO
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.060]   as being the direct correlation of the Warsaw Pact,
[02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:05.180]   which is, in other words,
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:08.900]   just something dominated completely by the United States.
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:10.860]   Now, that, of course, is why getting back to Trump again,
[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:12.740]   Trump was always going, you know, to the Europeans,
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:14.820]   if this is really supposed to be collective security
[02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:17.500]   and a mutual defense pact, why are you guys not paying?
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:19.940]   You know, why does the United States pay for everything?
[02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:21.780]   But, you know, NATO was actually conceived
[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:25.780]   as collective defense, you know, mutual security.
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:28.300]   And it was set up by, you know, the United States,
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:30.900]   along with the UK and France and, you know,
[02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:33.740]   Germany and Turkey and, you know, other countries.
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:36.940]   And we see that now with the entry of Finland and Sweden.
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:38.700]   They didn't have to join NATO.
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:40.340]   They didn't want to join NATO for a long time.
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:42.140]   They wanted to partner with it, just like Israel
[02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:44.860]   and the other countries partner with NATO.
[02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:46.860]   But once they thought that their security was really at risk,
[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:48.900]   they wanted to be part of it.
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:51.180]   And so, you know, kind of, you're now really seeing,
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:54.820]   you know, that NATO was something other than just being,
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:58.060]   you know, a creature or an instrument of the United States.
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:22:59.980]   But that's how Putin always saw it.
[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:03.860]   So, you know, what this debate about NATO is all about,
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:06.460]   or Russia being provoked,
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:09.980]   is wanting to kind of return to an old superpower,
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:13.180]   bipolar relationship, where everything is negotiated
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:14.900]   with the United States.
[02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:17.420]   It's to try to deny that Ukraine or Belarus,
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:19.620]   well, Belarus has kind of been absorbed by this point,
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:22.380]   you know, by Russia or Moldova or Kazakhstan
[02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:25.380]   or any of the other countries have any kind of agency,
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:28.020]   not even Poland or Hungary or, you know,
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:30.020]   kind of France and Britain.
[02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:32.780]   For years and years and years,
[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:36.460]   senior people like Putin and people around the Kremlin
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:38.980]   have demanded a return to the kind of what they call
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:41.460]   the old concert of Europe or the concert of Vienna,
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:43.260]   where the big guys,
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:46.380]   which now means the United States and Russia,
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:48.900]   just sit down and thrash everything out.
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.020]   And so, I mean, Putin by saying,
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:52.300]   "Look, it was provoked.
[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.300]   It's the United States, it's NATO.
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:56.860]   It's a proxy war, or it's this or it's that,
[02:23:56.860 --> 02:23:58.940]   or this is gonna be a nuclear confrontation.
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:00.220]   It's like the Cuban missile crisis
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:01.580]   or it's the Euromissile crisis."
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:03.500]   It's basically just saying, you know,
[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:06.100]   "I want to go back to when the Soviet Union
[02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:07.740]   and the United States worked things out.
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:09.580]   I want to go back to the whole, you know,
[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:11.620]   period of the 1980s when Gorbachev and Reagan
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:13.860]   just kind of got together and figured things out."
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:18.860]   Or, even better, back to Yalta, Potsdam, and Tehran
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:22.820]   and the big, you know, meetings at the end of World War II
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:24.900]   where we resolved the whole future security.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:26.540]   We've had a war, we've had the Cold War.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.500]   Now we've got another war.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.740]   We've got a real war, a hot war.
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.260]   We've got a war in Ukraine.
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:32.420]   It should be the United States and Russia
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:33.900]   that sort this out."
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:35.780]   So this is where we see the United States
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:36.900]   waffling about as well,
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.700]   trying to kind of like figure out how to handle this
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:41.500]   because it has to be handled in a way
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:43.060]   that Ukraine has agency.
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:44.380]   Because if Ukraine doesn't have agency,
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:45.700]   nobody else has agency either.
[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:48.660]   Nobody else has any kind of decision-making power.
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.420]   And, you know, we have an environment
[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:53.380]   in which Putin thinks that there's only really three players.
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.460]   There's the United States and Russia and China.
[02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:58.140]   And maybe occasionally it might be India
[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:00.100]   and perhaps Brazil or some other,
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:01.500]   South Africa or some other country,
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:03.660]   like maybe the BRICS at some point.
[02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.540]   But, you know, ultimately it's like the old days,
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:08.140]   big powers resolve everything.
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:12.860]   And so this war is also about Russia's right, Putin's right,
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:14.820]   you know, to determine things,
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:16.420]   you know, strong man to strong man,
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:18.500]   big country to big country,
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:20.100]   and, you know, determine, you know,
[02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:21.420]   where things happen next.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:23.380]   That's why he's talking about things being provoked
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:25.180]   and it's being the United States' fault.
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:29.300]   - But aren't there parts of the United States establishment
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:34.020]   that likes that kind of three-party view of the world?
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:35.700]   - Oh, there's always going to be people
[02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:38.220]   who like that part, that approach.
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:39.340]   Of course there is.
[02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:41.180]   But then they don't necessarily dominate.
[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:43.220]   That's the kind of thing that people kind of think about.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:45.460]   I mean, you know, Putin can, you know,
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:47.780]   read, you know, all the various articles
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.700]   and hear the kind of pronouncements of people.
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:51.940]   But, you know, this gets back to, you know,
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:54.500]   the way that the United States operates.
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.300]   You know, Putin saw that, you know,
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:57.700]   Trump wanted to have a, you know,
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.700]   top-down, you know, vertical of power.
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.300]   And other presidents have wanted to have that.
[02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:04.660]   But the United States is a pretty messy place.
[02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:06.660]   And we have all kinds of different viewpoints.
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:08.740]   Now, of course, we know that in Russia,
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:10.380]   everything, even criticism of the Kremlin
[02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:12.420]   is usually fairly orchestrated,
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:14.420]   usually to kind of flesh out, you know,
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:15.700]   what people think about things.
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.500]   When we had these hardliners saying, you know,
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:20.300]   we needed more destruction of Ukraine, not less,
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:22.340]   and that, you know, the army wasn't doing enough,
[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:23.540]   it was in many respects, you know,
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:25.180]   kind of encouraged by the Kremlin
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:27.100]   and to see how people would react to that.
[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:29.620]   You know, to kind of actually create a constituency
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:31.700]   for, you know, being more ruthless
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:33.300]   than you had before because, you know,
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:34.500]   they wanted to clamp down.
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:37.580]   In the United States, I mean, I can say whatever I want.
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:38.540]   It doesn't mean that I'm speaking
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:40.740]   on behalf of the White House.
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:43.100]   And, you know, even if I have been an advisor
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:44.980]   to this president, that president, and the other,
[02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:46.140]   it doesn't mean I'm, you know,
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:49.220]   basically speaking on behalf of the US government.
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:51.380]   But there's kind of always an assumption from the Russians
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:54.540]   that, you know, when people, you know, say this
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:56.780]   and people do advocate one thing over another,
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:26:59.140]   that they're, you know, it's operating,
[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:00.620]   there's a lot of mirror imaging,
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.340]   thinking that, you know, we're operating
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.420]   in the same kind of way.
[02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:06.340]   So yes, there are, of course, constituencies
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:07.700]   who think like that and would love it.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:08.540]   You know, to go back to that,
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:09.740]   and there are many people out there
[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:11.460]   with their own peace plans.
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:13.260]   All kinds of people, you know, out there
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:14.980]   trying to push this. - Yeah, but there does seem
[02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:18.140]   to be the engine of the military-industrial complex
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:21.300]   seems to give some fuel to the hawks
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:26.300]   and they seem to create momentum in government.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.860]   - Yeah, but other people do too.
[02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:28.900]   I mean, there's always, you know,
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:30.980]   kind of a checksum in again.
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:32.660]   - You believe in the tension of ideas.
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:34.500]   - I think there is a lot of tension.
[02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:35.340]   I mean, I've seen it.
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:36.900]   I've seen it inside of the government now, you know,
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:39.220]   and people can push back and that's why I speak out
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:41.380]   and I try to lay it out so that everybody can,
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:43.020]   you know, kind of figure it out for themselves.
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.420]   I said the same to you as I say to everybody.
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:47.780]   This is how I see the situation.
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:48.940]   And, you know, this is, you know,
[02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:50.860]   how we can analyze it here.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.740]   Now, look, do I think that we've handled, you know,
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:56.700]   the whole Russia account, you know, for years?
[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.620]   Well, no, we haven't.
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:02.100]   I mean, we've taken our eyes off the ball many times.
[02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:03.340]   We've failed to understand the way
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:05.260]   that people like Putin think.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.020]   You know, you talked earlier about, you know,
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:08.420]   we need to have empathy for, you know,
[02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:10.780]   all the people who like Trump or like Biden
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:12.460]   and somehow they think we've got to have
[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:14.420]   strategic empathy about Putin as well.
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:16.300]   We've got to understand how the guy thinks
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:18.900]   and why he thinks like he does.
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:21.020]   You know, he has got his own context
[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:24.100]   and his own frame and his own rationale.
[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:25.060]   And he is rational.
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:27.860]   He is a rational actor in his own context.
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:28.740]   And we've got to understand that.
[02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:30.620]   We've got to understand that he would take offense
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:33.100]   at something and he would take action over something.
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:34.740]   It doesn't mean to say that, you know,
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.980]   we are necessarily to blame by taking actions,
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:39.900]   but we are to blame when we don't understand
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:43.740]   the consequences of things that we do and act accordingly
[02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:45.540]   or, you know, take preventative action
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:47.740]   or recognize that something might happen
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:49.300]   as a result of something.
[02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:51.340]   - So you've been in the room with Putin.
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:54.260]   Let me ask you for some advice.
[02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:57.900]   And it's also just a good philosophical question
[02:28:57.900 --> 02:28:59.140]   for you or for me.
[02:28:59.140 --> 02:29:01.980]   If I have a conversation with Vladimir Putin right now,
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:04.500]   can you advise on what questions, topics,
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:07.460]   ideas to talk through to him as a leader,
[02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:08.820]   to him as a human?
[02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:11.060]   What would you like to understand about his mind,
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.140]   about his thinking?
[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:16.980]   - Yeah, remember what I said before
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:19.820]   that Putin always tries to, you know, reverse things.
[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:22.740]   He wants to hear the questions that people have.
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:27.500]   Because remember, he himself at different points
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.060]   has been a recruiter, which is, you know,
[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:31.140]   the way that you're operating now as well, right?
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:32.900]   You're asking an awful lot of questions.
[02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:34.580]   Your questions also betray, you know,
[02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:37.460]   often the times where you're thinking about things,
[02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:38.940]   you know, the kind of context.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:43.180]   You know, kind of any kind of dialogue like this
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:46.380]   reveals a lot about the, you know, the other person.
[02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:48.300]   And I've actually often, you know,
[02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:50.460]   noticed in these settings that Putin likes
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:52.140]   to have a lot of give and take.
[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:54.300]   So I think he would actually enjoy having a conversation,
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.500]   you know, with you.
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:30:00.500]   But again, he would always be trying to influence you,
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:02.220]   inform and influence.
[02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:03.060]   That's kind of, you know,
[02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:05.780]   part of the way that he always operates.
[02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:07.460]   So what you would have to, you know,
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:08.340]   be trying to think about,
[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:11.420]   so what is it you would want to elicit information from him?
[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:13.780]   You're trying to understand the guy's worldview.
[02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:15.420]   And what we're trying to also understand
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:17.380]   is if there's any room there
[02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:20.180]   where he might compromise on something.
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:22.220]   You know, so if your goal was to go in there,
[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:25.260]   you know, to talk about Ukraine at this particular moment,
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:28.860]   I mean, one of the problems that I've often seen
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.380]   in the sort of the meetings we've had with Putin
[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:32.820]   just ends up in sort of mutual recriminations.
[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:36.500]   You know, kind of, no, well, what about what you've done?
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:38.220]   Or no, you've done that about, you know,
[02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:40.860]   and there's always this whataboutism.
[02:30:40.860 --> 02:30:43.100]   I mean, it often say, well,
[02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:45.780]   you're saying that I've done this, but you've done that.
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:47.540]   The United States invaded Iraq.
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:48.980]   What's the difference between, you know,
[02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:50.860]   what I'm doing and all of the things
[02:30:50.860 --> 02:30:52.980]   that you've been doing here?
[02:30:52.980 --> 02:30:54.540]   I mean, what you would have to try to do
[02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:57.780]   is kind of elicit information about why,
[02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:00.700]   or what he is thinking about this particular moment in time
[02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:01.820]   and why he thinks it.
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:06.940]   - Yeah, the whataboutism is a failure case.
[02:31:06.940 --> 02:31:10.580]   I think that shows from all the interviews I've seen
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:13.260]   that with him, that just shows that he doesn't trust
[02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:14.580]   the person on the other side.
[02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:15.620]   - No, he doesn't.
[02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:18.860]   - Right, but I'm not cynical like people
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:22.980]   because they seem to think he's some kind of KGB agent
[02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:24.340]   that doesn't trust anybody.
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:25.180]   I disagree.
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.380]   I think everybody's human.
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:32.380]   And from my perspective, I'm worried about what I've seen
[02:31:32.380 --> 02:31:35.380]   is I think whether it's COVID,
[02:31:35.380 --> 02:31:40.380]   whether it's other aspects that I'm not aware of
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.820]   leading up to the invasion,
[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:45.820]   he seems to be less willing to have
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:48.620]   charismatic back and forth dialogue.
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:50.020]   - Yeah, an open discussion.
[02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:51.700]   Actually, I said, you asked me before
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:53.500]   about that issue of trust,
[02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:55.940]   and he often says he only trusts himself.
[02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:59.740]   And I said, he's often distrustful of people,
[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:02.500]   but he does trust some people for certain things
[02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:04.700]   where he knows it's within their competence.
[02:32:04.700 --> 02:32:09.460]   So he has people he trusts to do things
[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:10.900]   'cause he knows they'll do them
[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:12.620]   and he knows that they'll do them well,
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:16.820]   which is why he has his old buddies from St. Petersburg
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:18.300]   'cause he's known them for a very long time
[02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:21.460]   and he knows that they won't try to pull a fast one over him,
[02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:23.980]   but he also knows their strengths and their weaknesses
[02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:25.260]   and what they can be trusted to do.
[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.700]   I mean, he's learning that some of the people in the military
[02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:29.700]   that he thought were competent
[02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:31.860]   or people on other things are not, right?
[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:35.140]   And he tends to actually have a lot of loyalty
[02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:36.340]   to people as well.
[02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:38.100]   Or he also kind of thinks it's best to keep them
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:39.940]   inside the tent than outside.
[02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:41.340]   And he moves them around.
[02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:44.460]   He kind of, okay, he gives them multiple chances
[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:46.100]   to redeem themselves if they don't.
[02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:47.740]   It's not like he has them done in.
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:49.780]   I mean, yeah, there is a lot of that in the system,
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:52.060]   but the people that he's worked with for a long time,
[02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:53.780]   he moves them around to something else,
[02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:55.180]   perhaps where they can do less harm.
[02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:59.460]   Although we've often see that he has quite a small cadre
[02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:00.940]   of people that he's reliant on
[02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:02.780]   and they're not up to the task,
[02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:04.820]   which is kind of what's happening here.
[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:08.620]   But he also, in the past, has been more straightforward,
[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:10.980]   just like he was saying here, more pragmatic.
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:15.340]   And I think if you engaged with him in Russian,
[02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:17.740]   well, you're actually literally speaking the same language
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:20.100]   'cause there's so much lost in translation.
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:21.940]   I used to jump outside of my skin
[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:23.900]   listening to some of the phone calls
[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:26.740]   because the way that they kind of relayed
[02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:27.780]   with an interpreter--
[02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:29.900]   - Oh, 'cause you're listening to the translation?
[02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:31.220]   - No, 'cause I know I'm listening to the Russian
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:34.500]   and the translation, which is happening in real time.
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:36.500]   And having been at a translators' institute,
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:37.740]   it's really difficult.
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:40.060]   Look, an interpreter's a trend in the moment
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:42.900]   to do something, the synchroni privo,
[02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:47.900]   the synchronized or the real-time translation.
[02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:51.460]   So translation is an art as well as a skill.
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:54.500]   If you're doing simultaneous translation,
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:55.580]   that's the word in English,
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:58.180]   synchroni privo in Russian,
[02:33:58.180 --> 02:33:59.900]   you're kind of focused in the moment
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:01.940]   on the fragments of the discussion,
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:05.620]   trying to render it as accurately as you possibly can.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:06.660]   And when you come out of that,
[02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:10.140]   you can't relay the entire conversation.
[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.420]   And often, what translators do is they take
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:14.780]   this little short-hand note like journalists do.
[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:18.140]   And afterwards, they've just been caught up in the moment
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:20.260]   and they haven't got the big picture.
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.500]   Consecutive translation is different.
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:25.140]   Kind of you're trying to convey the whole mood
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:28.140]   of big chunks of dialogue that have already been there.
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:30.740]   But sometimes you might not get that right either.
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:33.460]   And it breaks up the flow of the discussion.
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:34.620]   - Right, it's terrible.
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:37.940]   - And often, it's kind of the person who translates,
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:39.020]   it's different.
[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:41.220]   Some of our best translators are women.
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:44.620]   But hearing a woman's voice translating a guy
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:47.660]   who has a particular guy's way of speaking,
[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:51.300]   and a macho way of speaking, and a crude way of speaking,
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:54.580]   be that Putin, or I've seen that happen with Erdogan,
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:56.300]   the president of Turkey,
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:00.220]   and it gets translated by a much more refined female speaker,
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:02.660]   you've just lost the whole thing.
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:05.820]   And many of the translators on the Russian side
[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:07.900]   are not competent in English
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:09.340]   in the way that you would hope they are.
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:11.340]   It's not just that they're not native speakers,
[02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:13.060]   they're just not trained to the same high standards
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:15.140]   they used to be in the past.
[02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:19.180]   And you lose the nuance, you lose the feel.
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.740]   You almost need the interpretive actor
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:26.420]   doing the interpretations.
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:28.180]   You need to match it as much as you can
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:31.020]   in the way that you do voiceovers in film.
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:33.580]   The best way to talk to Putin
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:37.620]   is one-on-one in his own language.
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:39.660]   And I have a really great friend here
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:41.620]   who is one of the best interpreters,
[02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:46.620]   and Putin is often asked by the media to interpret for him.
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:48.860]   He was at the Institute that I was at,
[02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:51.420]   I mean, I know him from that kind of period.
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:52.500]   And he is just excellent,
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:55.220]   just like Pavel Polashenko was absolutely phenomenal
[02:35:55.220 --> 02:35:56.300]   at interpreting Gorbachev.
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:35:58.540]   Now, he didn't always interpret him accurately
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:00.900]   'cause Gorbachev made lots of grammatical gaffes,
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:03.940]   and sometimes Gorbachev himself would joke
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:06.340]   that Polashenko spoke better for Gorbachev
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:07.900]   than Gorbachev could himself.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:09.740]   But Putin is actually quite precise
[02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:11.620]   and careful in the way that he speaks
[02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:13.060]   because there's a lot of menace sometimes
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:13.900]   to things deliberately,
[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:15.380]   other times there's lots of humor,
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:18.060]   and he's telling a joke for a particular reason.
[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:19.100]   And a lot of it is, I mean,
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:21.300]   he actually uses the richness of the Russian language
[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:22.660]   and the crudity of language
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:23.500]   that can't be conveyed in English.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:24.820]   - And also facial expressions that go along with it.
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:26.860]   - Yeah, facial expressions, body language,
[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:29.580]   the way that he sits back in the chair and slouches,
[02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:31.780]   the kind of the way that he makes fun of people
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:33.900]   and he kind of uses irony.
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:36.620]   Just some of it is just lost and it needs to be conveyed.
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:39.060]   - The depth of humor and wit,
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:42.740]   I've met quite a few political leaders like that
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:45.740]   and they speak only Russian when I was traveling in Ukraine.
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:50.500]   I don't know how you translate that.
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:51.780]   I think it's almost,
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:54.140]   the other person that reminds me like that a little bit
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:54.980]   is Obama.
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:58.940]   Obama had a wit and an intelligence,
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:02.940]   but he would smile as he said something
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.780]   that add a lot to it.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:09.180]   That he's trolling you or he's being sarcastic.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:11.580]   Me converting into words.
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.420]   It's obvious that all English speakers,
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:14.940]   if they listen to Obama,
[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:16.780]   but if you had to translate to a different language,
[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:17.900]   I think you're gonna lose a lot of that.
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:19.860]   - Yeah, I mean, when I watched the,
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:22.580]   I mean, I watched many of Putin's speeches,
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:23.420]   just in Russian,
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:26.020]   not looking at any of the subtitles or anything.
[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:28.420]   And it's just watching the way that his body language is
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:30.220]   at the time when he's saying things,
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:32.500]   the way that you smirk, he'll sneer,
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:35.420]   he'll laugh, he'll ad lib,
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:37.140]   kind of from something that obviously kind of,
[02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:39.860]   wasn't there on the prepared speech.
[02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:41.220]   And it's really critical.
[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:43.500]   And kind of a lot, some people speak,
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:48.100]   like Trump, it's just needs kind of just words.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:52.220]   Putin, the words are very important.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.380]   Trump, it's the atmosphere.
[02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:55.260]   It's the kind of the way you feel about things.
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:57.980]   It's the buzz you get, it's revving people up.
[02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:00.820]   It's the kind of slogans and Putin,
[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:02.420]   he's conveying a lot.
[02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:03.260]   - And what he's saying there.
[02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:05.540]   - But I think, I mean, of course I don't know much
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:07.580]   'cause I only speak Russian and English,
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:11.220]   but I have in English or Russian have not met
[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:17.180]   almost anyone ever as interesting in conversation as Putin.
[02:38:17.180 --> 02:38:21.220]   I think he shines not in speeches,
[02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:23.180]   but in interactions with others.
[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:25.020]   - Yeah, when you watch those interviews and things with him,
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:26.820]   and I've been at many of these sessions,
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:29.580]   it's been hours of him parrying questions.
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:33.220]   And it's like watching a boxer sparring
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:35.220]   in a kind of training bout.
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:36.700]   Yeah, come on, give me another one.
[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:38.700]   You know, and it's kind of like, and he prides himself.
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:42.740]   And he's made mistakes often,
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:45.660]   but the breadth of the issues that he's often covered
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:47.340]   has been fascinating.
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.620]   And I used to just take, you know,
[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.220]   kind of really detailed notes about this
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:52.940]   because you learn a ton.
[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:54.940]   But it's also about his worldview again.
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:58.820]   I mean, he does live in a certain box, like we all do.
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:02.060]   And, you know, again, his world experience
[02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:04.060]   is not as extensive as, you know,
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:05.540]   you would hope it would be.
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:07.340]   But that's why you have to really pay attention.
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:09.460]   That's where we've messed up.
[02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:11.900]   That's where we haven't really paid a lot of attention
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:13.700]   to what he's been saying.
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:17.980]   He's been telegraphing this grievance,
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:20.260]   this dissatisfaction, this,
[02:39:20.260 --> 02:39:22.260]   I'm gonna do something for years.
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:26.580]   - And the thing is during war time,
[02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:31.380]   the combined with propaganda
[02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:35.060]   and the narratives of resentment and grievance
[02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:37.620]   that you dig in on those.
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:40.700]   Like maybe you start out not believing it,
[02:39:40.700 --> 02:39:43.500]   but you're sure it's all gonna believe it eventually.
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.300]   - Well, you convince yourself over time.
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:49.060]   Yeah, look, the longer you're in a position like Putin,
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:51.700]   22 years now, coming from 23 years,
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:54.540]   could be out there for 36 years.
[02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.540]   You become more and more rigid.
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:57.740]   I mean, this is, again, you know,
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.460]   something that you see in history.
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:01.740]   You know, you look at people through history
[02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:03.860]   have moved from kind of being kind of left wing
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:08.100]   and in their perspectives to hard right.
[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:09.180]   They kind of have a,
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:10.940]   but kind of a sort of an ossification
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:12.500]   or a rigidity emerges in their views.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.340]   I mean, again, I used to have these arguments
[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.140]   with Professor Pius about Lenin,
[02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:17.180]   'cause he would talk about Lenin.
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:19.340]   I said, "But he didn't change his mind from being 18.
[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:20.340]   "Have you not thought about that?"
[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:21.180]   I mean, it's like,
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:25.220]   we're not formed, fully formed individuals at 18.
[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:26.500]   You know, we don't know anything.
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:27.940]   We know something, but not everything.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:30.100]   I mean, obviously the younger context,
[02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:31.780]   you know, the kind of the way that you kind of grow up,
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:32.620]   the place you grew up,
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:34.620]   the things that happened to you, the traumas you have.
[02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:36.260]   I mean, all of these have an impact.
[02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:38.420]   But then if you don't grow beyond all of that,
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:41.180]   and Putin's been stuck in place since 2000,
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:42.220]   when he became president.
[02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:43.780]   He's not out and about, you know,
[02:40:43.780 --> 02:40:46.180]   kind of being a man of the people.
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:48.740]   You know, he's not doing the kind of things
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:49.580]   that he used to do.
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:51.220]   Yeah, he gets out there and he goes to Kazakhstan
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:53.180]   and, you know, Tajikistan,
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:55.700]   and he goes to China and he does this and that.
[02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:57.420]   And then to COVID, he didn't go anywhere.
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:59.100]   I mean, very few places.
[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:00.740]   And so he's got stuck.
[02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:03.100]   And that worries me a lot,
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:04.860]   because you could see before that he, you know,
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:07.580]   had a bit more of flexibility of thought.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:09.580]   And that's why nobody should be in place forever.
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:11.220]   You should always kind of like get out there
[02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:13.260]   and go out there and learn a new skill.
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:15.340]   You know, kind of, he needs some,
[02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:16.180]   he needs to sort of, you know,
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:18.020]   he needs to get out more and do something different.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:19.620]   - You had an interesting point you've made
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:24.100]   that both Vladimir Zelensky and Putin
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:28.740]   are thinking about, they're just politicians.
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:31.340]   They're thinking about the 2024 election,
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:32.700]   which is coming up for both of them.
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:34.100]   - Yeah, I've said that in some of the other interviews.
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:34.940]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:36.500]   - That's so interesting.
[02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:37.340]   I mean, I--
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:38.540]   - 'Cause their election's gonna be pretty much
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:39.620]   at the same time.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:41.220]   - As the US election also.
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:42.300]   - Oh, there's gonna be before.
[02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:43.820]   I mean, 'cause it's sometime in that, you know,
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:46.100]   early part of the year for the presidential election.
[02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:47.660]   - Yeah, and also, I don't know if you know
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:48.700]   about US elections,
[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:51.260]   but they actually last way longer than a year.
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:52.180]   - We're in it now, aren't we?
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:53.020]   You know, already.
[02:41:53.020 --> 02:41:54.580]   - We're already starting.
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:56.740]   So there's gonna be a significant overlap.
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:58.660]   - Yeah, you know, you're right.
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:00.700]   - Do you think that actually comes into play
[02:42:00.700 --> 02:42:02.460]   in their calculus?
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:03.980]   - I think it was one of the reasons
[02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:06.740]   why Putin invaded in February of 2022,
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:07.860]   'cause it was gonna be two years.
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:09.860]   I mean, he thought it'd be over by March of 2022,
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:12.580]   and he got two years to prepare for, you know, the election.
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:14.260]   And he got a big boost, you know, not only,
[02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:15.460]   he got a boost from Crimea.
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:16.580]   I mean, I didn't mention that before.
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:18.980]   I mean, one of the reasons for invading Crimea
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:21.340]   and annexing or invading Ukraine the first time
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.100]   and annexing Crimea was, look what happened to his ratings.
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:25.900]   They went from kind of declining,
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:27.220]   and they were still pretty good, you know,
[02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:28.100]   by anybody's standards,
[02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:30.260]   to just rocketing off into the stratosphere.
[02:42:30.260 --> 02:42:32.140]   I mean, I didn't really meet anybody in Russia
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:34.700]   who thought that annexing Crimea was, you know,
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:36.300]   kind of a bad thing.
[02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:38.340]   I mean, even, you know, kind of people who opposed Putin
[02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:39.300]   on so many other things.
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:41.620]   Crimea was, you know, "Krim nash," they kept saying.
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:44.260]   You know, this is kind of, you know, we got it back.
[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:45.660]   You know, it should never have gone away.
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:49.300]   It was ours, you know, but, you know, this is more complex.
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:51.340]   And he wasn't, I don't think at the time,
[02:42:51.340 --> 02:42:53.500]   planning on annexing all of Ukraine
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:55.380]   when he went in this special military operation.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:58.060]   He was going to try to turn it into what Belarus has become,
[02:42:58.060 --> 02:42:59.700]   you know, part of a, you know,
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:01.620]   bring back the Commonwealth of Independent States
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:05.060]   or the union, then a new union with Belarus and Ukraine
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.980]   and Russia over time.
[02:43:05.980 --> 02:43:10.740]   But certainly, you know, remove Ukraine as a major factor,
[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.580]   independent factor on the world stage,
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:16.180]   and, you know, consolidate Crimea and maybe, you know,
[02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:18.380]   kind of incorporate Donetsk and Luhansk, you know,
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:20.540]   kind of that was also a possibility.
[02:43:20.540 --> 02:43:23.620]   But it wasn't in his intention, in any case,
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:25.380]   to have something on this kind of scale.
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:27.100]   He wanted to get on with then preparing
[02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:29.060]   for what was going to be, he would think,
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:32.700]   the cakewalk, the shoe-in of the next presidential election.
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:33.620]   I mean, last time around,
[02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:35.100]   he had to invent a bit of competition
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:38.020]   with this person who's reputed to be his goddaughter,
[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:40.460]   Ksenia Sobchak, you know, for a bit of, you know,
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:42.380]   kind of entertainment for people.
[02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:45.020]   This next time around, you know,
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:47.260]   maybe he wasn't really planning on running, you know,
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:49.740]   against any other, you know, serious opposition.
[02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:51.580]   He was just going to have the acclaim of, you know,
[02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:56.180]   the kind of the great leader, like President Xi in China.
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:43:58.220]   You know, Putin, you know, was basically,
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:00.500]   I think, you know, he also hoped that he would be able
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:02.260]   to devolve some authority away, you know,
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:04.660]   kind of so he's more like the, you know,
[02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:06.500]   the supreme leader kind of figure,
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:08.420]   the czar-like figure, the monarch.
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:09.860]   And then, you know, other people get on
[02:44:09.860 --> 02:44:12.820]   with the chief executive, prime ministerial,
[02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:14.540]   running the country, and he could kind of, like,
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:16.340]   step back and just enjoy this, you know,
[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:17.260]   maybe there was going to be, again,
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:22.260]   a new union of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine,
[02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:25.820]   in some, you know, fashion, and he could preside over that.
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:27.300]   - So speaking of opposition,
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:32.300]   you've criticized the famed Putin critic, Alexei Navalny.
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:34.500]   What's the nature of your criticism?
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:36.420]   - Well, it hasn't really been a kind of a criticism
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:38.540]   in the way that, you know, people have implied,
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:40.900]   but more just reminding people that Navalny
[02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:43.340]   isn't some stooge of the West, as other people have,
[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:46.700]   you know, kind of depicted him in the Russian film,
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:47.940]   but, you know, saying that this is kind of,
[02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:49.660]   you know, he's pro-Western.
[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:53.100]   He's a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot.
[02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:56.980]   You know, in the past, he's articulated, you know,
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:44:58.420]   things are not so dissimilar
[02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:00.500]   from some of the people around Putin.
[02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:02.860]   And it's more just reminding people that, you know,
[02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:05.420]   just because you kind of see somebody, you know,
[02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:07.140]   as a kind of an opposition figure
[02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:09.500]   or somebody who might be more palatable from, you know,
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:11.700]   your perspective looking from the West,
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:13.060]   they're not always going to be, you know,
[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:14.380]   what you think they are.
[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:16.620]   Alexei Navalny is a Russian,
[02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:18.740]   and, you know, in a particular Russian context,
[02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:20.700]   he's different from Putin,
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:22.940]   but he wouldn't necessarily, you know,
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:25.220]   kind of run, you know, the Russian system
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:27.260]   in ways that we will like.
[02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:29.700]   So that's kind of, it's not a kind of a criticism.
[02:45:29.700 --> 02:45:32.420]   It's more of a critique of the way that we look at things.
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:34.140]   You know, I think it's a mistake to always, you know,
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:36.300]   say, "Oh, this is pro-Western," or, "This is a, you know,
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:38.780]   liberal." I mean, what the heck does that mean, pro-Western?
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:40.060]   I mean, he's a Russian.
[02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:42.020]   He's a Russian nationalist and a Russian patriot.
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:44.180]   And he's often, you know, been, you know,
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:47.140]   quite critical about immigration.
[02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:49.180]   He's had some negative views about, you know,
[02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:51.500]   from one point of view, he said, "Don't feed the Caucasus,"
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:53.740]   you know, kind of played upon some of the, you know,
[02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:56.780]   the racial and ethnic tensions inside of,
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:58.580]   you know, Russia itself as well.
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:00.980]   Now, he is a pluralist, you know, and he's kind of,
[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:02.740]   and he wants to have, you know,
[02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:06.860]   a different set of political actors there,
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:08.660]   but he also isn't promoting revolution.
[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:09.500]   He's not Lenin.
[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:12.260]   He's not wanting to bring down the state.
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:13.460]   He wants to kind of, you know,
[02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:16.700]   change the people who are in charge.
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.340]   That's what he's being basically focused on.
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.420]   And, you know, he might have,
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:22.700]   and have things and do things that, you know,
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:24.700]   we elsewhere might not like.
[02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:27.020]   - And I guess the bigger picture there is,
[02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:32.300]   it's not trivial to know that if you place another human
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:36.220]   in power to replace the current human in power,
[02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:37.340]   that things are going to be better.
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:38.900]   They could be a lot worse.
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:42.900]   Because there's a momentum to a system.
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:44.660]   A system is bigger than just this leader,
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:47.900]   even when that leader has a huge amount of power.
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:49.180]   - That's absolutely right.
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:51.500]   And, you know, he grew up in that, you know, same system.
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:53.060]   Now he's younger than Putin,
[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:56.060]   so he's got a different generational perspective.
[02:46:56.060 --> 02:46:59.140]   And he's not wedded to the Soviet Union,
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:01.380]   or, you know, kind of some concept of the Russian empire.
[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:02.620]   He doesn't seem to spend a lot of time,
[02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:04.380]   I don't know what he's doing, you know, in jail,
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:05.900]   but he's probably not sitting around, you know,
[02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:07.380]   reading Lomonosov and, you know,
[02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:10.060]   kind of the great kind of tracts of Russian history.
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:11.220]   Could be, actually.
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:12.220]   But I mean, I think, you know,
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:13.620]   Navalny has a different worldview
[02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:14.620]   and a different perspective,
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:17.100]   just like Medvedev was different, you know,
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:20.300]   in his time in presidency and made some, you know,
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:22.380]   changes and some innovations there.
[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:23.660]   But don't think that they're going to be
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:24.500]   radically different.
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:25.820]   Because look, Gorbachev, I mean,
[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:29.740]   he was so different from Andropov and Cherenko
[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:31.500]   and others as a person,
[02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:34.220]   but he was also constrained by the system.
[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:35.500]   And he wanted to have change,
[02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:36.820]   but he wanted evolutionary change.
[02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:37.660]   He didn't know how to do it,
[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:39.180]   but he didn't want to bring the whole system down.
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:40.540]   Look at Khrushchev.
[02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:41.580]   When he came in, you know,
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:45.820]   after that whole period of, you know,
[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:47.140]   everybody trying to figure out what to do
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:49.180]   after Stalin had died and there was all this
[02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:50.020]   kind of back and forth,
[02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:51.300]   and eventually Khrushchev emerges.
[02:47:51.300 --> 02:47:53.380]   And, you know, he tries to make changes to the system,
[02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:56.980]   but he's also a creature of a very specific context.
[02:47:56.980 --> 02:47:58.380]   He's grown up in the same system.
[02:47:58.380 --> 02:47:59.860]   And he, you know, kind of brings
[02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:01.940]   all kinds of elements of chaos there,
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:03.460]   you know, to the whole thing.
[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:06.660]   And, you know, gets into a standoff with the United States,
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:09.460]   that we know is the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:11.380]   and eventually, you know, gets removed.
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:12.780]   You know, we're looking at what's happening
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.780]   in the United Kingdom right now.
[02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:19.380]   You know, they've just churned through three prime ministers
[02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:21.620]   and actually five prime ministers in, you know,
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:22.540]   kind of as many years,
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:24.260]   but all of those prime ministers have come out
[02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.060]   of the context of the Conservative Party.
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:28.540]   They're all, you know, kind of just shades of,
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.620]   you know, the same thing.
[02:48:29.620 --> 02:48:31.580]   They've all come out of the same academic
[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:33.980]   and, you know, kind of privileged backgrounds.
[02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:37.060]   Even Rishi Sunak, the new prime minister,
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:40.900]   who's the first, you know, Indian or Anglo-Indian
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:43.340]   prime minister in British history.
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:44.740]   It was a kind of phenomenal, you know,
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:47.180]   kind of as a child of Indian immigrants,
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:50.020]   but also a person of great privilege
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:53.580]   from the same academic and party background as the others.
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:55.740]   You know, so there are always differences
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:58.500]   with those human beings, but those contexts matter a lot.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:01.780]   - What is the probability that Russia attacks Ukraine
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:03.660]   with a tactical nuclear weapon?
[02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:06.940]   - Well, Putin's definitely been thinking about it, right?
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:07.980]   I mean, he is the kind of person,
[02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:08.820]   if he's got an instrument,
[02:49:08.820 --> 02:49:10.460]   he wants to figure out how to use it.
[02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:12.820]   You know, we look at polonium, we look at Novichok,
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:14.660]   you know, we look at all kinds of things,
[02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:17.860]   you know, that he's also presided over in Syria.
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:21.780]   He has, you know, put in charge of the war in Ukraine now.
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:24.460]   General Savrykin is known as General Armageddon,
[02:49:24.460 --> 02:49:26.140]   you know, the kind of person who, you know,
[02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:29.380]   pretty much facilitated the use of chemical weapons
[02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:31.540]   in Syria, you know, for example.
[02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:34.020]   So, you know, don't think that Putin, you know,
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:36.420]   hasn't thought about how ruthless he can possibly be.
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:38.820]   The question is really the calculation.
[02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:41.300]   It's his estimation of the probability
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:43.100]   that it will get the desired effect.
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:46.860]   We keep talking about this idea of escalate to deescalate.
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:48.860]   That's not what the Russians, you know, how they call it,
[02:49:48.860 --> 02:49:50.700]   but it's the whole idea that you do something
[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:53.700]   really outrageous to get everybody else to back off.
[02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:55.740]   Now, when you talked about the precedent
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:57.540]   that the United States set
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:03.340]   of detonating the nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
[02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:05.980]   what, you know, he obviously meant the precedent
[02:50:05.980 --> 02:50:07.380]   of using nuclear weapons, of course,
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:09.100]   which, of course, we would then say,
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:13.180]   well, we showed them how the impermissibility
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:14.460]   of ever doing that again.
[02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:16.260]   But what he's talking about is the precedent
[02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:19.100]   of escalating to such an extent that you stop the war,
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:21.820]   because he reads that saying, well, you know,
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:24.500]   the US dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:26.540]   The war was brought to a quick conclusion.
[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:28.860]   And of course, there's a huge debate in America
[02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:30.500]   about whether it was necessary to do that,
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:32.100]   whether the war was ending anyway.
[02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:35.260]   Did that really, you know, kind of change the minds
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:36.900]   of the Japanese high command?
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:38.220]   I mean, there's all kinds of books
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:40.660]   and being written about that.
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:43.140]   And of course, you know, the revulsion that people felt
[02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:44.900]   in the wake of that was just, you know,
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:47.100]   just the shock of what actually happened.
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:49.300]   And we've spent, you know, 70 years, you know,
[02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:50.940]   basically coming to terms with the fact
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:52.580]   that we did something like that.
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:53.740]   You know, the firebombing, you know,
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:55.940]   we've also looked at all the bombing, you know,
[02:50:55.940 --> 02:50:57.500]   in Vietnam and everywhere.
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:00.420]   And, you know, all these massive bombing campaigns
[02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:03.020]   and realizing they actually often had the opposite effect.
[02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:05.660]   Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have contributed
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:07.300]   and there's a lot of, you know, scholarship suggesting
[02:51:07.300 --> 02:51:08.620]   it did to the end of the war.
[02:51:08.620 --> 02:51:10.220]   But all of the big bombing campaigns,
[02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:12.060]   the destruction actually prolonged wars
[02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:13.460]   because they made people fight back,
[02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:15.020]   as we're kind of seeing in the case of Ukraine.
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:18.620]   So Putin has to calculate the probability
[02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:21.940]   that if he uses some tactical nuclear weapon,
[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:23.340]   that it will get the desired effect,
[02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:26.500]   which is get us to capitulate and Ukraine to capitulate.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.380]   Us to capitulate, meaning the United States and the Europeans
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.820]   not supporting Ukraine anymore,
[02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:32.540]   pushing towards a negotiating table
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:34.300]   and negotiating Ukraine away.
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:36.420]   And Ukraine saying, "Okay, we give up,"
[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:41.300]   like happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or in Japan.
[02:51:41.300 --> 02:51:43.980]   So it's his calculation, you know,
[02:51:43.980 --> 02:51:45.740]   as much as anything else, which is really important.
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:46.860]   He said, "We have to show him
[02:51:46.860 --> 02:51:48.180]   that he won't get that out of it."
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:49.780]   It's kind of less our probability
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:50.940]   and, you know, kind of the odds of it.
[02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:54.180]   It's just how he calculates that probability
[02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:56.020]   of getting what he wants.
[02:51:56.020 --> 02:51:58.340]   - I mean, I guess that's how the game of poker works.
[02:51:58.340 --> 02:52:02.900]   It's your probability and your estimate of their probability
[02:52:02.900 --> 02:52:05.660]   and your estimate of their estimate of your probability
[02:52:05.660 --> 02:52:08.180]   and so on and so forth. - Yeah, so it goes on.
[02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:10.060]   - I think he has two tools, right?
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.820]   So one is the actual use of nuclear weapons
[02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:14.020]   and then the threat of the-
[02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:15.780]   - Oh, the threat is very effective.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:19.580]   - And the more real you make the threat-
[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:20.420]   - That's right.
[02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:24.300]   - So it's like the more you approach the actual use,
[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:25.140]   like get very close to using it.
[02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:28.140]   - But actually he's already using Chernobyl,
[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:31.260]   Zaporizhzhya and then usual cranes,
[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:33.380]   the other nuclear reactors.
[02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:36.300]   So he's using civilian nuclear reactors as a dirty bomb.
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:40.100]   So, you know, it's ironic that he has Sergei Shoigu,
[02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:41.540]   his defense minister, calling people up and saying,
[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:42.900]   "The Ukrainians are gonna use a dirty bomb."
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:44.100]   They're already doing it.
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:47.540]   I mean, what is, you know, kind of more destructive
[02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:49.940]   than stirring up all the radioactive dust in Chernobyl
[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:52.460]   as you send your troops through, you know, for example,
[02:52:52.460 --> 02:52:54.900]   or shelling, you know, the Chernobyl plant
[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:57.140]   and the sarcophagus and putting it at risk.
[02:52:57.140 --> 02:52:58.740]   And Zaporizhzhya, you've got the
[02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:00.460]   International Atomic Energy Agency
[02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:02.100]   running out there in utter panic
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:05.020]   and, you know, kind of also trying to intervene
[02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:06.180]   in the conflict.
[02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:07.220]   So you're putting, you know,
[02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:09.780]   civilian nuclear reactors at risk.
[02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:11.580]   I mean, that also has the great added effect
[02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:13.660]   of cutting off Ukraine's power supply
[02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:16.100]   because Zaporizhzhya in particular was,
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:19.780]   what was it, a third of Ukraine's power generation
[02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:21.380]   or some, you know, really high percentage.
[02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:23.380]   I'll have to go back and, you know, take a look at that.
[02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:25.540]   But that's a twofer, you know,
[02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:27.620]   it's a kind of a double effect there
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:30.980]   of undermining power generation,
[02:53:30.980 --> 02:53:32.900]   also frightening Germans and others
[02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:35.020]   who've already been very worried about nuclear power
[02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:37.460]   and, you know, increasing your leverage on the energy front,
[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:41.180]   but also scaring people from the perspective
[02:53:41.180 --> 02:53:43.500]   of the use of nuclear weapon.
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:46.180]   Those reactors also become a nuclear weapon,
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:47.420]   tactically deployed.
[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:51.460]   And as you said, the discussion of using a nuclear weapon
[02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:53.620]   and engendering all those fears,
[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:55.660]   and he's already got an effect.
[02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:56.780]   Everyone's running around talking about
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:59.300]   the Cuban Missile Crisis and secret diplomacy
[02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:01.140]   and how we negotiate away Ukraine
[02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:03.860]   in return for Putin not blowing up a nuclear weapon.
[02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:05.820]   So he's got a lot of people already talking about that.
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:09.740]   - So sorry for the difficult and dark question.
[02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:13.340]   It could be for you directly or more like,
[02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:15.220]   do you think we have a plan for this?
[02:54:15.220 --> 02:54:20.220]   What happens if he does drop a nuclear weapon?
[02:54:20.220 --> 02:54:25.220]   Do you have a sense that the United States has a good plan?
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:29.380]   - I know we're talking about it.
[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:30.860]   I think we probably have several plans
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:34.140]   because it depends on what, where, when, how.
[02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:39.860]   - But don't, and also don't these things happen very quickly?
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:44.900]   - Well, there's also signaling and signs of movement there.
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:46.980]   I mean, I want to be very kind of careful about this,
[02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:47.820]   but then the thing is,
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:49.980]   it's also very important that we do this
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:51.540]   with other nuclear powers.
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:53.660]   So the other thing that's different
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.580]   from how it might've been in the past,
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.700]   and particularly different from the Cuban Missile Crisis
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:58.620]   and the Euromissile Crisis,
[02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:00.620]   we're not the only nuclear players.
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:03.100]   China has a major nuclear arsenal now,
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:06.540]   less on the strategic side, but building it up,
[02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:10.420]   but very much on the intermediate range and tactical.
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:13.260]   Kim Jong-un is firing off weapons left, right, and center
[02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:14.380]   at the moment in North Korea.
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:15.540]   We've got other rogue states.
[02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:18.140]   Putin's behaving like a rogue state, just to be very clear.
[02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:20.820]   And this is what we've got with Kim Jong-un in North Korea.
[02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:23.740]   We've also got India and Pakistan,
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:25.140]   and we've got other states
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:26.220]   that we're not supposed to talk about
[02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:27.740]   that we know have nuclear capacities,
[02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:30.660]   and others that would like to have nuclear capacity.
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:34.780]   And the whole question here is about also proliferation.
[02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:38.500]   Getting back to that time when Ukraine had nuclear weapons,
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:40.180]   at least there on its territory
[02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:41.580]   instead of Belarus and Kazakhstan,
[02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:44.180]   you've got to wonder, was it wise for them to give it up?
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:48.740]   We were worried about loose nukes, nuclear weapons,
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:50.140]   getting out of hand.
[02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.260]   Proliferation at the time, we wanted fewer nuclear powers.
[02:55:53.260 --> 02:55:54.820]   Russia wanted that too.
[02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:56.220]   Now we're going to have more.
[02:55:56.220 --> 02:55:57.220]   We've got more.
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:55:58.740]   And what Putin is saying is,
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:00.020]   well, that was stupid of Ukraine
[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:01.580]   to give up the nuclear weapons.
[02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:04.140]   In fact, my colleagues and I, back in our report
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:05.460]   and back in the U.S.S.R., kind of suggest
[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:07.020]   they shouldn't give them up.
[02:56:07.020 --> 02:56:09.460]   And then that's why we had the Budapest memorandum.
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:10.620]   That's why the United States,
[02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:12.700]   the United Kingdom in particular,
[02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:16.460]   have basically some responsibility and obligation
[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:19.300]   going back to 1994 when they promised Ukraine
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:20.620]   that gave up the nuclear weapons,
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:22.620]   their territorial integrity and sovereignty
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:23.820]   would remain intact,
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:26.060]   some obligation to actually do something to step up.
[02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:27.540]   If we step back from that,
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:30.500]   this is the thing that people are not talking about,
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:31.980]   you know, what about nuclear proliferation?
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:33.900]   If you're South Korea, Japan,
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:35.060]   you know, you're any other country
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.380]   that's kind of worrying about your neighbors,
[02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:39.380]   and you know, what might happen to you?
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:41.340]   Just like India and Pakistan are both like,
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:42.900]   "Oh, you know, we've got to kind of keep
[02:56:42.900 --> 02:56:45.020]   our strategic nuclear balance here."
[02:56:45.020 --> 02:56:46.620]   Everything is up for question.
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:48.220]   Saudis will want a nuclear weapon.
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:49.260]   The Turks already want one.
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:50.860]   They've talked about one for years.
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:52.500]   You know, why should the Iranians be the only one
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:54.780]   with an Islamic nuclear weapon?
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:56.980]   You know, and if we know that, you know,
[02:56:56.980 --> 02:57:00.620]   Iran has breakout capacity now,
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:03.380]   the Saudis and all the other, you know, states
[02:57:03.380 --> 02:57:04.860]   that are in opposition to Iran
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:06.820]   will also want to have some nuclear capacity.
[02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:08.660]   And the United States before wanted to maintain
[02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.100]   everything under the nuclear umbrella.
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:11.820]   You know, one of the reasons why Sweden and Finland
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:13.620]   are joining NATO is because of, suddenly,
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:15.500]   all of these nuclear threats.
[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:17.620]   Sweden was actually the last country on the planet
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:18.660]   to want to have nuclear weapons.
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:20.220]   They were actually pushing for a ban
[02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:21.740]   on nuclear weapons in the United Nations.
[02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:25.340]   Now that Putin's doing the nuclear saber-rattling,
[02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:27.300]   you know, they're talking about joining
[02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:31.300]   and are on the verge of joining a nuclear alliance.
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:33.060]   You know, see what's happening here.
[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:36.140]   So we have to make it more and more difficult
[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:37.540]   for Putin to even contemplate that.
[02:57:37.540 --> 02:57:39.460]   That's why people are saying this is reckless,
[02:57:39.460 --> 02:57:40.860]   this is irresponsible.
[02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:42.900]   Putin is actually making the world less safe
[02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:44.500]   for himself down the line either,
[02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:46.460]   but he's thinking short-term here.
[02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.780]   He's thinking, "What can I do?
[02:57:47.780 --> 02:57:49.380]   What do I actually have?"
[02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:51.100]   You can also destroy lots of infrastructure,
[02:57:51.100 --> 02:57:52.420]   as he's doing.
[02:57:52.420 --> 02:57:53.500]   You can use subversion.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.580]   You know, we're worried about all of the undersea cables,
[02:57:55.580 --> 02:57:57.180]   all these weird things happening, you know,
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:57:59.220]   off Orkney or in the Mediterranean,
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:01.740]   or, you know, all these other things that are happening,
[02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:04.540]   Nord Stream 2, pipelines, other infrastructure.
[02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:05.540]   There's all kinds of other things
[02:58:05.540 --> 02:58:07.060]   that he can do as well here.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.020]   It's not just, you know,
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:11.620]   again, this is a civilian nuclear threat
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:14.220]   of blowing up, you know, one of the reactors.
[02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:16.540]   Now, he's got to be sure about where the wind turns
[02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:18.300]   and the wind blows.
[02:58:18.300 --> 02:58:21.340]   And there's all kinds of things to, you know, factor in here.
[02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:23.940]   But Putin is definitely sitting around
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:25.300]   calculating with other people,
[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:28.180]   "What can I do to turn this around?"
[02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:31.340]   I mean, he still thinks that he can win this.
[02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:35.660]   Or, in other words, he can end it on his terms.
[02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:41.140]   Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia.
[02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:43.020]   And, you know, capitulation,
[02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:47.420]   all recognized as being part of Russia.
[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:49.340]   Or he can freeze it and then, you know,
[02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:51.500]   kind of figure out where it goes from there,
[02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:52.980]   what other pressure he can put on.
[02:58:52.980 --> 02:58:56.060]   I mean, I'm sure he's confident he can get rid of Zelensky.
[02:58:56.060 --> 02:58:57.620]   And he can prevail over us.
[02:58:57.620 --> 02:59:00.140]   I mean, look, I mean, the UK is going through prime ministers,
[02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:02.780]   you know, faster than I'm changing my socks, you know.
[02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:07.420]   So it's like, you know, he can prevail on the, you know,
[02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:10.580]   basically he can have an impact
[02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:13.660]   on the political scene in Europe and elsewhere.
[02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:16.020]   I mean, again, everyone's talking about winter coming.
[02:59:16.020 --> 02:59:18.220]   And Putin's thinking, "Yeah, great.
[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:21.620]   I've, you know, destroyed the infrastructure of Ukraine."
[02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:23.620]   - Are you worried about the winter?
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:24.700]   - Well, yeah, but I mean, look,
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:27.020]   the other thing is that we have to start preparing.
[02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:28.940]   I mean, we have to start thinking about this.
[02:59:28.940 --> 02:59:32.100]   We've got a wartime economy situation.
[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:33.100]   That's where we are.
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:34.940]   We've got the home front to think about as well.
[02:59:34.940 --> 02:59:36.980]   Putin has declared war on us.
[02:59:36.980 --> 02:59:38.500]   He did that on September 30th.
[02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:40.260]   And he's done it at other points as well.
[02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:42.580]   We've just not paid attention.
[02:59:42.580 --> 02:59:44.820]   But he pretty much, pretty explicit on September 30th.
[02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:47.820]   I mean, go back and watch that speech.
[02:59:47.820 --> 02:59:50.940]   And, you know, he is gambling that, you know,
[02:59:50.940 --> 02:59:52.780]   people will go back, you know,
[02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:55.340]   to basically taking Russian gas and oil,
[02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:58.020]   but it's not gonna be that simple as well.
[02:59:58.020 --> 02:59:59.980]   And do people, and then, you know,
[02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:00.820]   the question has to be,
[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:03.540]   do we really kind of think he's gonna play fair after that?
[03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:06.540]   When he's kind of also shown that he can leverage that.
[03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:09.140]   - It's such a complicated world.
[03:00:09.140 --> 03:00:10.140]   - It is complicated.
[03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:10.980]   It's very complicated.
[03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:11.980]   - And it's never, I mean,
[03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:15.100]   it feels like things are heating up.
[03:00:15.100 --> 03:00:20.100]   Like, and China is very quiet right now.
[03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:22.700]   - Because they're watching what happens.
[03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:24.220]   I mean, for President Xi,
[03:00:24.220 --> 03:00:28.140]   you know, he's trying to consolidate his power
[03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:29.860]   even further after the party Congress,
[03:00:29.860 --> 03:00:32.260]   but he doesn't want to look like he made a mistake
[03:00:32.260 --> 03:00:34.180]   by backing Putin.
[03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:36.740]   I mean, he thought Putin was also gonna be in out,
[03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:39.740]   and Ukraine would probably be open
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:41.420]   for massive Chinese investment.
[03:00:41.420 --> 03:00:46.420]   China was the largest investor in Ukraine before the war.
[03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:47.540]   Largest single investor.
[03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:49.220]   I mean, the EU was bigger, of course.
[03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:51.740]   - How do you hope the war ends in Ukraine?
[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:56.740]   - Well, I mean, I do hope it ends, you know,
[03:00:56.740 --> 03:00:59.100]   with a ceasefire and a negotiated solution,
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:02.060]   but it has to be with Russia compromising on something.
[03:01:02.060 --> 03:01:03.540]   And that's not where we are right now.
[03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:08.020]   - Do you think both sides might be willing to compromise?
[03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:10.380]   - Most wars always end in that way.
[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:11.740]   I mean, nobody's ever happy.
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:14.180]   - But they don't seem to, either side,
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:17.820]   like legitimately doesn't want to compromise right now.
[03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:18.780]   - Yeah, because I mean, look,
[03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:22.460]   the thing is that for Ukraine right now,
[03:01:22.460 --> 03:01:25.980]   anything is a compromise at its expense, right?
[03:01:26.020 --> 03:01:29.780]   Vast devastation, unbelievable casualty rates,
[03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:33.620]   biggest refugee crisis since World War II.
[03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:35.700]   Russia's just said, "Sorry, this is our territory.
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:36.660]   It's not just Crimea."
[03:01:36.660 --> 03:01:39.380]   I think there could have been a negotiation over that.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:40.940]   But, you know, Donetsk and Luhansk,
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:42.860]   I mean, we've got all kinds of formulas we've had
[03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:45.580]   all the way through history of, you know,
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:47.460]   putting things under a kind of guardianship,
[03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:49.580]   receivership of territory, the United Nations,
[03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:51.740]   all kinds of different ways of formulating that.
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:53.380]   We could have easily been creative.
[03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:54.620]   But Russia's basically saying, "Nope, sorry,
[03:01:54.620 --> 03:01:57.420]   we've taken this and any other negotiations,
[03:01:57.420 --> 03:02:01.260]   just you recognizing this for us not doing more destruction."
[03:02:01.260 --> 03:02:04.540]   I mean, that is not the basis for a negotiation.
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.260]   And, you know, having, you know, kind of people come
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:07.700]   and just sort of laying those terms down
[03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:09.380]   is not a starting position.
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:13.900]   I think Russia is also, you know,
[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:16.380]   in a dilemma of its own making now
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:18.420]   because Putin has made it very difficult, you know,
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:21.460]   to compromise just by everything that he said.
[03:02:21.460 --> 03:02:24.260]   Now, for Ukraine, they've already won
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:27.780]   a great moral, political, and military victory.
[03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:31.140]   It's just hard to see it, right, at the particular moment.
[03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:33.980]   They've done what the Finns did in the Winter War,
[03:02:33.980 --> 03:02:35.980]   which the Finns were devastated by the Winter War as well,
[03:02:35.980 --> 03:02:37.740]   but they pushed them back.
[03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:39.180]   Now, the Finns lost a lot of territory.
[03:02:39.180 --> 03:02:42.020]   They lost Karelia and, you know, huge swathes of territory,
[03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:44.980]   but they got to be Finland.
[03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:47.300]   And now they're, you know, joining NATO,
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:49.100]   but they've been part of the EU.
[03:02:49.100 --> 03:02:51.820]   The question is how to, you know,
[03:02:51.820 --> 03:02:55.980]   get Ukraine to be Ukraine in a success.
[03:02:55.980 --> 03:02:58.300]   But, you know, is, and that's the challenge.
[03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:01.140]   Now, again, they've already won psychologically,
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:05.260]   politically, militarily, because Putin hasn't succeeded
[03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:07.140]   in what he wanted to do, but he has succeeded
[03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:09.340]   in completely and utterly devastating them.
[03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:12.220]   And this is the kind of the old Muscovite,
[03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:14.700]   the old Russian imperial, old Soviet mentality,
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:17.860]   you know, going all the way back to when the Muscovites
[03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:20.380]   were the bag men for the, you know, the horde,
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:22.660]   for the Mongols, it was destruction.
[03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:25.900]   You know, you don't play with us, we'll destroy you.
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:27.260]   You know, people talk about it as mafia,
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:29.420]   but it's all, you know, all you have to go down
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:32.540]   is to go and see Tarkovsky's "Andrei Rublyov."
[03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:34.140]   I mean, I remember, you know, seeing that film
[03:03:34.140 --> 03:03:35.780]   when I was first as a student in Moscow
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:38.460]   and just being, whoa, this is so brutal.
[03:03:38.460 --> 03:03:42.540]   I mean, this is just unremittingly brutal,
[03:03:42.540 --> 03:03:46.660]   because the whole point is that you show people
[03:03:46.660 --> 03:03:48.140]   who's the boss.
[03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:50.860]   The destruction is the point of things as well,
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:55.860]   because, you know, you are emphasizing your domination.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:59.020]   And that's what Putin is doing right now,
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:02.620]   is saying, okay, you want to go in a different direction,
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:05.180]   so be it, but I'm going to make you suffer.
[03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:09.660]   Remember when Khodorkovsky got out of the penal colony,
[03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:11.500]   when Putin let him out eventually?
[03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.100]   He said he's suffered enough.
[03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:16.380]   But he suffered for 10, 11 years.
[03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:19.820]   I don't think Putin feels that Ukraine
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:21.300]   has suffered enough at this point,
[03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:22.140]   or we have suffered enough.
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:24.860]   - So there's a part of this invasion
[03:04:24.860 --> 03:04:27.140]   that's punishment for something.
[03:04:27.140 --> 03:04:29.180]   - Yeah, it's medieval.
[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:31.500]   I mean, look, we're all capable of the same things, right?
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.580]   There was all that destruction,
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:35.140]   and that's what Assad was like in Syria,
[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:37.660]   like his father, who you destroy
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:39.580]   because you teach him a lesson.
[03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:41.700]   And look, Britain did that in the colonial era.
[03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:43.820]   I mean, all the history of British colonialism
[03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:45.460]   is exactly the same.
[03:04:45.460 --> 03:04:47.500]   I mean, all the Mao Mao, you know, and Kenya,
[03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:50.740]   you know, up until recent times, brutality.
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:53.460]   Teaching people, you know, teaching them a lesson.
[03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:54.740]   You have to suffer.
[03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:55.580]   The US did it.
[03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:57.020]   I mean, we did it with the Native Americans.
[03:04:57.020 --> 03:04:59.340]   You know, we did it all over the place, you know, as well.
[03:04:59.340 --> 03:05:02.020]   This is kind of what big states do
[03:05:02.020 --> 03:05:04.420]   at different points in history.
[03:05:04.420 --> 03:05:07.420]   It's just that, you know, Russia has not moved on from that.
[03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:08.780]   And we've learned some lessons later.
[03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:10.700]   I hope we fully internalize them,
[03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:12.580]   of things that we've done, you know,
[03:05:12.580 --> 03:05:13.860]   kind of the past United States,
[03:05:13.860 --> 03:05:16.100]   we ideally are trying to do better,
[03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:17.940]   and most of Europe's trying to do better as well.
[03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:20.500]   Think about France and Algeria, you know, again.
[03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:23.580]   You know, we can see this in many different settings.
[03:05:23.580 --> 03:05:25.620]   But I think, you know, for Putin right now,
[03:05:25.620 --> 03:05:28.180]   he hasn't taught all of us sufficient a lesson.
[03:05:28.180 --> 03:05:32.420]   - I just, I talked to hundreds of people in Ukraine,
[03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:35.620]   and the tough thing,
[03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:38.660]   the inspiring thing is that there's a unity.
[03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:43.660]   The tough thing is a lot of them speak intensely of hate
[03:05:43.660 --> 03:05:47.020]   towards not just Russia, but Russians.
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:47.860]   Russians.
[03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:50.300]   - That's how Europeans felt about Germany and Germans
[03:05:50.300 --> 03:05:51.660]   at the end of World War II.
[03:05:51.660 --> 03:05:55.420]   - And generational hate.
[03:05:55.420 --> 03:05:59.220]   Like, I don't think that hate is gonna pass.
[03:05:59.220 --> 03:06:01.140]   - Well, it might well take a generation.
[03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:04.300]   I mean, when I was a kid in the '70s,
[03:06:04.300 --> 03:06:06.980]   I went on exchanges to Germany.
[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:09.380]   And that was like, you know, 30 years,
[03:06:09.380 --> 03:06:10.980]   more than 30 years after the end of the war.
[03:06:10.980 --> 03:06:14.100]   My grandfather, who'd fought in World War I,
[03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:17.220]   wouldn't speak to my parents when they sent me on a,
[03:06:17.220 --> 03:06:18.060]   I mean, he hadn't fought in World War II,
[03:06:18.060 --> 03:06:20.540]   he fought in World War I, and he hated the Germans.
[03:06:20.540 --> 03:06:23.340]   And he did not want me going, you know,
[03:06:23.340 --> 03:06:24.700]   to Germany as an exchange student.
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:27.420]   He refused to meet, you know, kind of the German kid
[03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:30.340]   who, you know, came to stay at my house, you know,
[03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:31.180]   for example.
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.100]   I mean, it takes a long time to,
[03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:35.100]   you know, it takes a long time to get over that.
[03:06:35.100 --> 03:06:38.220]   But you do, and we have, we have in Europe.
[03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:40.740]   And that was the whole point of, you know,
[03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:44.300]   all of that kind of exercise of European unity
[03:06:44.300 --> 03:06:45.500]   after World War II.
[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:48.500]   Now, the big challenge is, what do we do with Russia?
[03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:49.460]   Because a lot of people are talking now,
[03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:51.140]   we can't have European security without Russia.
[03:06:51.140 --> 03:06:53.580]   Other people are saying, we can't have a Europe,
[03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:56.020]   you know, kind of with Russia.
[03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:57.900]   You know, so how do we deal with this?
[03:06:57.900 --> 03:06:59.980]   We've got to basically kind of,
[03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:02.420]   it's gonna be like Japan and Germany
[03:07:02.420 --> 03:07:04.060]   after World War II, after this.
[03:07:04.060 --> 03:07:06.340]   Just the level of the atrocities
[03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:07.340]   that have been carried out,
[03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:08.980]   as you said, the level of hatred.
[03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:12.180]   But we found a way of doing it.
[03:07:12.180 --> 03:07:16.020]   Now, a lot of it will require change
[03:07:16.020 --> 03:07:18.220]   on the part of Russia as well, and Russians,
[03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:19.140]   and really thinking about this.
[03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:21.660]   I mean, Gorbachev before tried to deal
[03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:25.820]   in the late 1980s with the black spots in,
[03:07:25.820 --> 03:07:27.940]   with glasnost, with openness
[03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:29.740]   and talking about Russian history,
[03:07:29.740 --> 03:07:32.420]   just kind of never, sort of withered on the vine
[03:07:32.420 --> 03:07:33.420]   as time went on.
[03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:37.740]   - What gives you hope about the future?
[03:07:37.740 --> 03:07:39.060]   - Well, my hope comes into the fact
[03:07:39.060 --> 03:07:40.340]   that we've done things before,
[03:07:40.340 --> 03:07:41.900]   that we've got ourselves out of tough times
[03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:44.580]   and we've overcome stuff and in people,
[03:07:44.580 --> 03:07:46.260]   because I meet amazing people.
[03:07:46.260 --> 03:07:47.820]   You just talked about hundreds of people
[03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:49.380]   that you've met within Ukraine.
[03:07:49.380 --> 03:07:52.500]   And, you know, people all think differently,
[03:07:52.500 --> 03:07:54.580]   contexts and circumstances change
[03:07:54.580 --> 03:07:55.740]   and people can evolve.
[03:07:55.740 --> 03:07:58.340]   Some people get stuck, Putin's got stuck,
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:00.460]   but people can evolve.
[03:08:00.460 --> 03:08:02.460]   And, you know, I do think that
[03:08:02.460 --> 03:08:04.180]   if we all pull together
[03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:06.020]   and we've seen this in so many contexts,
[03:08:06.020 --> 03:08:07.700]   we can find solutions to things,
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:08.780]   just like we get back again
[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:10.620]   to our discussion about scientists
[03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:13.660]   and just the kind of amazing breakthroughs of,
[03:08:13.660 --> 03:08:15.500]   you know, what we did on COVID
[03:08:15.500 --> 03:08:18.660]   or done on, you know, kind of other diseases and things.
[03:08:18.660 --> 03:08:21.460]   And look, there is some similarities.
[03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:24.380]   There's a pathology around war and conflict.
[03:08:24.380 --> 03:08:27.100]   Years ago in the 1990s, I worked on,
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:29.140]   you know, a lot of the projects
[03:08:29.140 --> 03:08:31.340]   that were funded by the Carnegie Corporation
[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:34.260]   of the United States under the then presidency
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:36.380]   of David Hamburg, who was a scientist.
[03:08:36.380 --> 03:08:38.220]   And I actually did see a lot of parallels
[03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:40.260]   between the sort of like the pathology of disease
[03:08:40.260 --> 03:08:43.860]   and, you know, kind of the pestilence,
[03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:46.140]   you know, of conflict kind of idea.
[03:08:46.140 --> 03:08:47.460]   And of course, these, you know, parallels
[03:08:47.460 --> 03:08:50.020]   had to be very careful because, you know, they're not neat.
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:51.620]   But there was kind of like an idea in there
[03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:52.900]   and how do you sort of treat this?
[03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:54.820]   How do you deal with this?
[03:08:54.820 --> 03:08:57.540]   And we did come up with all kinds of ideas
[03:08:57.540 --> 03:08:59.980]   and, you know, things that are still out there.
[03:08:59.980 --> 03:09:02.420]   We've created institutions that have helped to keep the peace.
[03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:04.860]   We just have neglected them,
[03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:07.940]   allowed them to degrade, just like the United Nations.
[03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:11.860]   And, you know, we've created problems inside of them,
[03:09:11.860 --> 03:09:14.420]   like the veto power of the permanent powers
[03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:17.420]   on the UN Security Council.
[03:09:17.420 --> 03:09:19.060]   But we can change that.
[03:09:19.060 --> 03:09:20.140]   You just got to have a will.
[03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:21.460]   And I do think out there,
[03:09:21.460 --> 03:09:23.300]   there are sufficient people with a will
[03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:25.100]   and we've just got to get people mobilized.
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:26.540]   I mean, I'm always amazed by how people
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:29.060]   can mobilize themselves around a crisis.
[03:09:29.060 --> 03:09:31.340]   Remember Winston Churchill, I don't quote all the time
[03:09:31.340 --> 03:09:33.060]   'cause I can never remember half his quotes,
[03:09:33.060 --> 03:09:34.340]   but I do remember the one about
[03:09:34.340 --> 03:09:36.820]   never let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:09:36.820 --> 03:09:39.820]   And I always think that that, you know, yeah,
[03:09:39.820 --> 03:09:43.100]   we shouldn't let this crisis go to waste.
[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:44.580]   And something else can come out of this,
[03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:46.340]   just like in Ukraine, we worried before
[03:09:46.340 --> 03:09:50.140]   about corruption in Ukraine, the influence of the oligarchs.
[03:09:50.140 --> 03:09:51.700]   We've got our own oligarchs here in the US
[03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:53.540]   we need to, you know, deal with as well.
[03:09:53.540 --> 03:09:56.380]   But this is a chance to do it differently.
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:58.420]   Yeah, it really is a chance to do things differently.
[03:09:58.420 --> 03:10:00.820]   - And a part of that is young people.
[03:10:00.820 --> 03:10:02.060]   I have to ask you.
[03:10:02.060 --> 03:10:02.900]   - And it's young people.
[03:10:02.900 --> 03:10:04.460]   I mean, I'm feeling a bit on the older side now,
[03:10:04.460 --> 03:10:05.660]   but I still feel I've got, you know,
[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:08.460]   a bit of, you know, kind of youth within me at 57.
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:10.180]   I'm not that old, but I'm not that young,
[03:10:10.180 --> 03:10:12.700]   but we have to work together with younger and older people.
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:14.700]   You've got to work together in coalitions of,
[03:10:14.700 --> 03:10:16.580]   you know, across generations.
[03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:20.300]   - You remind me of kids who just graduated college
[03:10:20.300 --> 03:10:23.660]   and say, and I feel old.
[03:10:23.660 --> 03:10:24.820]   And say, yeah, no.
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:27.260]   - I don't actually feel old, but it is a number age.
[03:10:27.260 --> 03:10:29.540]   And you know, when you kind of think about, when I was--
[03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:30.780]   - I thought you don't like math.
[03:10:30.780 --> 03:10:32.620]   - Yeah, yeah, I don't like things like that.
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:34.260]   Yeah, but I find it interesting.
[03:10:34.260 --> 03:10:35.700]   But you know, when I was, I remember when I was a little kid
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:37.380]   I kept thinking about the year 2000
[03:10:37.380 --> 03:10:38.900]   and I thought, oh my God, I'll be dead.
[03:10:38.900 --> 03:10:39.980]   I'll be 35.
[03:10:39.980 --> 03:10:41.780]   (laughing)
[03:10:41.780 --> 03:10:42.740]   22 years ago.
[03:10:42.740 --> 03:10:46.780]   - You've overcome a lot of struggle in your life
[03:10:46.780 --> 03:10:50.220]   based on different reasons, as you write about.
[03:10:50.220 --> 03:10:54.580]   Class being one of them.
[03:10:54.580 --> 03:10:57.380]   Your funny sounding accent being another,
[03:10:57.380 --> 03:10:59.380]   or just representation of class.
[03:10:59.380 --> 03:11:03.500]   But in general, through all of that,
[03:11:03.500 --> 03:11:06.280]   to be at the White House,
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:11.180]   to be one of the most powerful voices in the world,
[03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:14.780]   what advice would you give from grounded in your life story
[03:11:14.780 --> 03:11:17.260]   to somebody who's young, somebody who's in high school
[03:11:17.260 --> 03:11:19.620]   and college thinking of how they can have
[03:11:19.620 --> 03:11:22.180]   a big positive impact on the world?
[03:11:22.180 --> 03:11:24.340]   - Well, we all have a voice, right?
[03:11:24.340 --> 03:11:25.860]   We all have agency.
[03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:28.340]   We all actually have the ability to do something.
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:31.060]   And you can start small in your local community
[03:11:31.060 --> 03:11:32.460]   or even in your own classroom,
[03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:34.220]   just helping somebody else out
[03:11:34.220 --> 03:11:37.060]   or speaking up and advocating on behalf of things.
[03:11:37.060 --> 03:11:40.180]   When I was about 11 years old,
[03:11:40.180 --> 03:11:43.060]   I got involved with other kids on Save the Whales.
[03:11:43.060 --> 03:11:46.060]   We had all this kind of, we were hardly Greta Thunberg,
[03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:48.220]   but we kind of got together in a kind of network
[03:11:48.220 --> 03:11:50.660]   writing to people and trying to raise money
[03:11:50.660 --> 03:11:52.380]   to help save the whales.
[03:11:52.380 --> 03:11:54.260]   Now, actually the whales of the world
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:11:55.740]   are doing somewhat better.
[03:11:55.740 --> 03:11:58.380]   I can't say that that was because of me and my network,
[03:11:58.380 --> 03:12:01.020]   but it was kind of a way of organizing
[03:12:01.020 --> 03:12:04.020]   and kind of joining in a larger movement.
[03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:06.660]   Everybody can be part of something bigger.
[03:12:06.660 --> 03:12:09.340]   The thing is, it's all about working together with others
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:11.420]   and giving other people a chance as well.
[03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:14.260]   I think one thing is that our voices
[03:12:14.260 --> 03:12:17.300]   have more impact when they're amplified.
[03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:19.260]   They don't have to be the voices of discord
[03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:20.620]   or the voices of hate.
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:24.620]   You've been trying to do this with your podcast,
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:28.020]   kind of give people a voice, give them a kind of platform
[03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:30.940]   and get them to join in with other people.
[03:12:30.940 --> 03:12:32.900]   And one of the things that I've been trying to do
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:35.700]   is kind of go and talk to just as many people
[03:12:35.700 --> 03:12:36.940]   as I possibly can and say,
[03:12:36.940 --> 03:12:39.420]   "Look, we can all do something here.
[03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:41.900]   "We can all lend our voices to a cause
[03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:43.100]   "that we care deeply about.
[03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:44.700]   "We can be kind to each other.
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.180]   "We can give other people a chance.
[03:12:46.180 --> 03:12:47.340]   "We can kind of speak out
[03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:48.980]   "while we see that something is wrong.
[03:12:48.980 --> 03:12:52.020]   "And we can try to explain things to people."
[03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:53.900]   And what I'm trying to do at the moment
[03:12:53.900 --> 03:12:56.500]   is just sort of explain what I've learned about things
[03:12:56.500 --> 03:12:58.980]   and hope that that helps people
[03:12:58.980 --> 03:13:00.780]   make informed judgments of their own
[03:13:00.780 --> 03:13:02.740]   and that kind of maybe take things further
[03:13:02.740 --> 03:13:03.900]   and learn something more.
[03:13:03.900 --> 03:13:06.780]   It's like kind of like building up on the knowledge
[03:13:06.780 --> 03:13:09.980]   that I have to try to impart to others
[03:13:09.980 --> 03:13:11.900]   and everybody can do that different ways.
[03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:13.460]   You can kind of reach back.
[03:13:13.460 --> 03:13:15.420]   Yeah, if you're 14, help somebody who's seven.
[03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:17.940]   If you're 21, help somebody who's 14.
[03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:20.580]   Kind of in the kind of my age now,
[03:13:20.580 --> 03:13:22.660]   I'm always trying to reach back
[03:13:22.660 --> 03:13:26.380]   and work with younger people, listen to younger people,
[03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:29.500]   help them out, make connections for them,
[03:13:29.500 --> 03:13:31.140]   listen to what they have to say about something,
[03:13:31.140 --> 03:13:34.100]   try to incorporate that in things that I'm saying as well.
[03:13:34.100 --> 03:13:35.740]   The main point is that we've all got a voice,
[03:13:35.740 --> 03:13:37.500]   we've all got agency,
[03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:38.700]   and it always works better
[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:40.500]   when we work together with other people.
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:43.100]   - But sometimes it can feel pretty hopeless.
[03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:45.860]   It can feel, I mean, there's low points.
[03:13:45.860 --> 03:13:50.860]   You seem to have a kind of a restless energy,
[03:13:50.860 --> 03:13:52.540]   a drive to you.
[03:13:52.540 --> 03:13:54.900]   Were there low points in the beginning
[03:13:54.900 --> 03:13:59.380]   when in your early days,
[03:13:59.380 --> 03:14:01.220]   when you're trying to get the education
[03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:04.100]   where it may have not been clear to you
[03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:06.300]   that you could be at all successful?
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:07.980]   - Yeah, there always were.
[03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:10.860]   I mean, there were lots of points where I was just despondent
[03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:13.660]   but then I'd meet somebody
[03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:15.460]   who would just suddenly turn things around.
[03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:18.060]   I was this look or was I out there looking for it?
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:21.420]   Sometimes if you're open and receptive
[03:14:21.420 --> 03:14:24.700]   to hearing something from someone else.
[03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:27.740]   I mean, there were often times where I felt so despondent,
[03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:29.860]   in such a black mood, I didn't think I'd be able to go on.
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:32.820]   And then I'd have a chance conversation with somebody.
[03:14:32.820 --> 03:14:34.620]   I mean, I once remember, I was sitting on a bench,
[03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:36.620]   I was probably 11 or 12, just crying my eyes out,
[03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:37.460]   just really upset.
[03:14:37.460 --> 03:14:39.700]   And an old lady just came and sat next to me,
[03:14:39.700 --> 03:14:42.020]   put her arm around me, said, "Oh, it's all right, pet.
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:43.140]   "What's the matter?
[03:14:43.140 --> 03:14:44.580]   "It can't be that bad, can it?"
[03:14:44.580 --> 03:14:47.260]   And it was just this human embrace.
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:50.980]   It's like somebody just basically reaching out to me
[03:14:50.980 --> 03:14:52.860]   that snapped me out of it.
[03:14:52.860 --> 03:14:54.460]   And I thought, "Here's somebody just,"
[03:14:54.460 --> 03:14:55.300]   she didn't know who I was,
[03:14:55.300 --> 03:14:58.900]   she just felt really bad that I was sitting, crying.
[03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:01.740]   And I mean, I can't even remember what it was about anymore.
[03:15:01.740 --> 03:15:03.380]   Now it just seems inconsequential.
[03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:05.660]   At the time, I probably thought my life was at an end.
[03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:07.820]   Just sometimes people making eye contact
[03:15:07.820 --> 03:15:10.140]   with you in the street and saying something to you
[03:15:10.140 --> 03:15:12.620]   can kind of pull you out of something.
[03:15:12.660 --> 03:15:14.820]   And it's kind of a,
[03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:16.940]   I think you would just have to open yourself up
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:18.580]   to the prospect that not everyone's bad,
[03:15:18.580 --> 03:15:19.660]   just like you were saying before,
[03:15:19.660 --> 03:15:21.940]   that there's good in everybody.
[03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:25.820]   Even during that really difficult period of impeachment,
[03:15:25.820 --> 03:15:28.300]   I was trying to listen very carefully to people.
[03:15:28.300 --> 03:15:31.980]   And I thought, "Look, we still have something in common here.
[03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:33.420]   "We need to remember that."
[03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:36.380]   When people are kind of forgetting who they are
[03:15:36.380 --> 03:15:39.540]   or the context in their operating,
[03:15:39.540 --> 03:15:42.660]   there's always something that can pull you back again.
[03:15:42.660 --> 03:15:44.300]   There's always that kind of thread.
[03:15:44.300 --> 03:15:49.300]   - So I'm sure you were probably attacked by a lot of people
[03:15:49.300 --> 03:15:53.900]   and you were still able to keep that optimism that-
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:55.460]   - Well, I kept it into kind of perspective.
[03:15:55.460 --> 03:15:56.740]   Like when I was a kid, I mean,
[03:15:56.740 --> 03:15:58.660]   things I mentioned before, I got bullied,
[03:15:58.660 --> 03:16:00.460]   kind of, again, and I tried to understand
[03:16:00.460 --> 03:16:01.620]   why they're doing this.
[03:16:01.620 --> 03:16:06.260]   One of the most amazing things that happened really on
[03:16:06.260 --> 03:16:08.500]   was my dad was a pretty incredible person
[03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:10.460]   and he would always open my eyes to something.
[03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:13.820]   I was getting bullied really nastily by a girl at school.
[03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:16.620]   And my dad started asking me questions about her.
[03:16:16.620 --> 03:16:19.980]   And one day, my dad said we were gonna go for a walk.
[03:16:19.980 --> 03:16:22.180]   And my town's very small.
[03:16:22.180 --> 03:16:24.860]   Remember, it's very depressed, really deprived area.
[03:16:24.860 --> 03:16:28.220]   And we go to this housing estate, public housing place
[03:16:28.220 --> 03:16:29.780]   that's not too far away from where I live.
[03:16:29.780 --> 03:16:32.500]   And it's really kind of one of the most run-down places
[03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:34.380]   and already run-down place.
[03:16:34.380 --> 03:16:36.980]   My dad knocks on the door and I said, "What are we doing, dad?"
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:39.060]   And I see he says, "We're going off to,
[03:16:39.060 --> 03:16:42.060]   we're gonna visit somebody, an old family friend."
[03:16:42.060 --> 03:16:44.260]   I think even a distant relative.
[03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:45.940]   We're knocking on the door and this old man answers the door
[03:16:45.940 --> 03:16:47.300]   and he's, "Oh, Alfie."
[03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:48.820]   My dad's name was Alf Alfie.
[03:16:48.820 --> 03:16:50.820]   You know, kind of, "Oh, fancy seeing you here.
[03:16:50.820 --> 03:16:51.660]   I haven't seen you.
[03:16:51.660 --> 03:16:52.580]   Come on in, have a cup of tea.
[03:16:52.580 --> 03:16:53.420]   What are you doing?"
[03:16:53.420 --> 03:16:54.620]   He said, "Oh, I'm just walking past with my daughter.
[03:16:54.620 --> 03:16:55.820]   We're going for a trip."
[03:16:55.820 --> 03:16:57.420]   There, we're going for a walk.
[03:16:57.420 --> 03:17:00.900]   And then suddenly I see that girl and she's in the kitchen.
[03:17:00.900 --> 03:17:03.740]   And I'm thinking, "Oh my God, bloody hell."
[03:17:03.740 --> 03:17:05.860]   You know, British expression, "What's this?"
[03:17:05.860 --> 03:17:09.300]   And it turns out that dad had figured out who she was.
[03:17:09.300 --> 03:17:10.980]   And he knew her grandfather
[03:17:10.980 --> 03:17:12.340]   and she was living with her grandfather.
[03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:14.220]   And she'd been abandoned by her parents.
[03:17:14.220 --> 03:17:16.900]   And she was living in, you know, pretty dire circumstances.
[03:17:16.900 --> 03:17:18.740]   And she'd been getting raised by her grandfather
[03:17:18.740 --> 03:17:20.500]   and she was just miserable.
[03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:21.780]   And the reason she was bullying me
[03:17:21.780 --> 03:17:24.060]   was to make herself feel better.
[03:17:24.060 --> 03:17:25.660]   And after that, she never bullied me again.
[03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:27.060]   I mean, we didn't even talk.
[03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:29.460]   Because there was a connection made.
[03:17:29.460 --> 03:17:31.660]   And suddenly she realized that her grandfather,
[03:17:31.660 --> 03:17:33.620]   who was the only person she had,
[03:17:33.620 --> 03:17:37.340]   knew my dad and they were friends or they were even family.
[03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:39.620]   Some kind of relationship there.
[03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:41.660]   I mean, I was raised half north of England.
[03:17:41.660 --> 03:17:43.060]   I had no idea how we were related.
[03:17:43.060 --> 03:17:44.500]   You know, everybody was some relative.
[03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:45.860]   Because people have lived there for generations
[03:17:45.860 --> 03:17:47.660]   to get in this very small area.
[03:17:47.660 --> 03:17:48.940]   And that turned things around.
[03:17:48.940 --> 03:17:50.900]   So just remember, you might have.
[03:17:50.900 --> 03:17:52.220]   And that's kind of suddenly taught to me
[03:17:52.220 --> 03:17:54.580]   there's always a reason why somebody is doing something.
[03:17:54.580 --> 03:17:56.700]   A lot of the times they're really unhappy with themselves.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:17:58.740]   Sometimes there's something else going on in their lives.
[03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:00.860]   Sometimes they just don't know any better.
[03:18:00.860 --> 03:18:03.060]   And I shouldn't take it personally
[03:18:03.060 --> 03:18:04.380]   because I don't have a personal connection
[03:18:04.380 --> 03:18:05.780]   with half these people who are out there
[03:18:05.780 --> 03:18:08.500]   saying that they want this and that to happen to me.
[03:18:08.500 --> 03:18:10.740]   - Well, thank you for the kindness and the empathy
[03:18:10.740 --> 03:18:11.980]   you still carry in your heart.
[03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:14.100]   I can see it through all that you must have gone through
[03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:16.540]   in the recent couple of years.
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:18.020]   It's really inspiring to see that.
[03:18:18.020 --> 03:18:20.620]   And thank you for everything you've done,
[03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:21.820]   for the work you've written,
[03:18:21.820 --> 03:18:24.100]   for the work you continue to write and to do.
[03:18:24.100 --> 03:18:27.740]   This seems like a really, really difficult time
[03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:29.820]   for human civilization on a topic
[03:18:29.820 --> 03:18:31.860]   that you're a world expert in.
[03:18:31.860 --> 03:18:33.980]   So don't mess it up.
[03:18:33.980 --> 03:18:34.820]   - No, I know, but that's what I was saying.
[03:18:34.820 --> 03:18:35.660]   Do everybody have that?
[03:18:35.660 --> 03:18:37.380]   Let's just keep it together, right?
[03:18:37.380 --> 03:18:39.340]   - Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:40.220]   - Let's just keep it together.
[03:18:40.220 --> 03:18:42.380]   - Your words have a lot of power right now.
[03:18:42.380 --> 03:18:45.380]   So it's a really, really tricky time.
[03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:46.780]   So thank you so much.
[03:18:46.780 --> 03:18:49.420]   Given how valuable your time is to sit down with me today.
[03:18:49.420 --> 03:18:50.260]   It was an honor.
[03:18:50.260 --> 03:18:51.100]   - No, thanks, thanks.
[03:18:51.100 --> 03:18:53.180]   No, it's a privilege and a pleasure to talk to you as well.
[03:18:53.180 --> 03:18:54.740]   No, thank you.
[03:18:54.740 --> 03:18:57.260]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Fiona Hill.
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:18:58.500]   To support this podcast,
[03:18:58.500 --> 03:19:01.420]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:19:01.420 --> 03:19:05.020]   And now let me leave you some words from John Steinbeck.
[03:19:05.020 --> 03:19:08.660]   Power does not corrupt, fear corrupts.
[03:19:08.660 --> 03:19:11.780]   Perhaps the fear of the loss of power.
[03:19:11.780 --> 03:19:14.100]   Thank you for listening.
[03:19:14.100 --> 03:19:15.980]   I hope to see you next time.

[03:19:18.580 --> 03:19:21.180]   (upbeat music)
