[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900]   The thing I love about Hilton is that their free night certificates are good for any category hotel as long as they have standard room availability.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.240]   So we used those hotel certificates last year to stay at a hotel that was $3,000 or $4,000 a night.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.160]   And right now, open a card.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.000]   The sign-up bonus includes a certificate.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.780]   Some of the cards, you get another one when you spend $15,000.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.320]   Some of them, it's $30,000.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.080]   It really depends.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.860]   There's a different flavor of card for everyone.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.980]   But the Aspire card also comes with diamond status on Hilton, which is their top tier.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.160]   That's how we ended up with four hotel status tiers.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.220]   I guess I don't have any IHG status, but haven't stayed in an IHG hotel for a really long time.
