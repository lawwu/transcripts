[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Are there any hacks or tips you've developed or helped people with
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.000]   to kind of get over those nerves and get over the need to be a perfectionist?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   You have to speak your target language from day one.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.600]   So I think one big mental barrier people have is they decide
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.700]   I'm going to study the language for a certain amount of time.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.100]   I'm going to learn Spanish.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.700]   So one year from now, I will have reached that magic moment
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.100]   when I can finally walk up to a native speaker and speak Spanish to them.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.600]   And I think that is a fool's errand because this creates a new situation
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   in your head where you have to wait until you're ready
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.000]   and then you can make all the excuses in the world that you're not ready yet
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500]   because you will never be at 100% perfectionism in Spanish,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.200]   even when you reach the very high levels I've talked about.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.600]   So to throw that out the window, you have to decide
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.700]   I'm going to speak it right away, even though I only know ten words.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700]   I'm still going to try and use it.
