[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.480]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.960]   John answered them, saying, I baptized with water, but there standeth one among you whom
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.240]   ye know not; and I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.020]   unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.480]   is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.040]   Now, we have reached the point in our consideration of this great and vital and all-important
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.080]   doctrine of the baptism with the Holy Spirit, at which we are considering how exactly this
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.800]   blessing is to be obtained. We have looked into the doctrine, we have seen the effects
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.560]   and the results, we have warned one another of certain dangers, and we have considered
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.600]   it in the light of the scriptural teaching, and as it is illustrated and emphasized and
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680]   re-emphasized in the subsequent history of the Christian Church.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.600]   And now we are looking at this most important aspect of this matter. This is not a theoretical
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.040]   matter. There is nothing more practical than this. I have given you, I think, abundant
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.480]   evidence to prove that it is men who have been baptized with the Holy Spirit whom God
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.520]   has used most signally in the long history of the Church. It is certainly the great characteristic
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.080]   in the lives of the saints who have known most what it is to enjoy God. You remember
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.560]   the definition of the Shorter Catechism, "What is the chief end of men?" The answer is,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   the chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. And the men and women
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.360]   who have known most of that blessed enjoyment are those who have testified to this baptism
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.040]   with the Spirit, something which has come to them and happened to them subsequent to
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.360]   their original conversion. And as I have been illustrating as we have gone along, this really
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.400]   is what is meant by revival. God has kept his work going by reviving it periodically,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.120]   sending a great revival. And a revival is simply the baptism of the Holy Ghost taking
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.240]   place to a large number of people at the same time. The Spirit comes upon them. And as you
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.520]   see so clearly in reading the history of the Church, it is these periods of revival and
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.160]   of reformation and renewal that have kept the Church alive and have enabled her to go
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.920]   on bearing the witness and the testimony. There is therefore nothing that is more urgent
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.000]   than this. This is undoubtedly the greatest need in the Church today, the greatest need
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   of the Church as a whole, the greatest need of individuals within the Church. I repeat
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:20.320]   again, there is nothing that I know that is so urgently important as this particular doctrine.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.400]   We must measure ourselves in terms of the pictures and the portrayals that we have in
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.800]   the New Testament of the Christian, not by what we see today, not by contrasting ourselves
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.560]   with others who are obviously below us or unworthy. It is not enough for us as Christian
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.280]   people to make sure that we are orthodox and to bemoan the statements that are made in
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   the name of Christ that are denials of the scriptural teaching. That is all right, that
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.960]   is very simple. But what you and I have to do particularly is to examine ourselves in
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.120]   the light of this picture. Are we, let me ask it again, are we rejoicing in the Lord
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   Jesus Christ with a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory? That is what we are meant
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.320]   to be. Very well, that is why this is all so important. And this immediate matter before
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   us as to how this blessing is to be obtained is clearly a matter that should be of prime
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   importance to all who really are concerned about the state of the Church and the evil
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.680]   of the days in which we are living, how helpless and powerless we seem to be. We see these
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.520]   forces of evil penetrating into almost every department and walk of life. You see it in
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.240]   literature, in music, in art, in architecture, in everything. And here the Church seems so
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.200]   weak. What does she need? She needs this power, the only thing that will authenticate her
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.520]   message and enable her to raise aloft this banner of God, to stem the tide of evil and
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.880]   of iniquity that is spreading over the land. Very well then, we have now seen that we are
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.200]   to seek this blessing, and we are to seek it by prayer, diligent prayer, and by careful
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   attention to our life and walk, trust and obey, prayer and faith and obedience. We have
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.240]   gone into that. And then last Sunday morning I was reminding you that once you begin to
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.120]   do this you must be prepared for surprises. There is nothing the devil is more anxious
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.000]   to prevent than that a Christian person should be baptized with the Holy Ghost. A formal
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.160]   Christian does not worry the devil. The formal Christian does not do much harm to the kingdom
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.720]   of the devil. But once a Christian is filled with the Spirit he becomes a menace. So it
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.880]   is inevitable almost that the moment you begin to seek this blessing you will find troubles.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.360]   Everything may seem to go against you as we saw, but you must go on, you must be patient,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:07.440]   you must continue in spite of every discouragement to seek this mighty blessing which is in the
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.080]   giving of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is he, this one upon whom the Spirit is to descend
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.640]   and remain upon him, God said to John, he is the one who is going to baptize with the
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.200]   Holy Ghost. It is in his sovereignty. And he gives this blessing in his own time and
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.440]   in his own way. Now that is the matter that I want to deal with first of all this morning.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.080]   I therefore put this heading to you. How is this blessing given or how does the baptism
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   of the Holy Ghost come to men? Now I do not mean by that a matter that we have already
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.560]   considered, namely this whole question of laying on of hands and so on, or these mechanical
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.400]   methods of rhythmic breathing and all the rest which suggest auto-suggestion and psychology.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.640]   I do not mean that. I rather mean something like this. The circumstances in which this
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:12.400]   blessing has generally come to people in the past. It is very helpful, very instructive,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.640]   and very encouraging to consider that. And you will find that it has generally happened
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.440]   in one of the following ways. One is of course, and it is one of the commonest of all, while
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:32.920]   the Christian is actually praying. The Christian may be praying alone or he may be in a prayer
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.880]   meeting. It has often happened like that. Perhaps that is the most frequent manner of
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.560]   all in which the blessing comes. And a very interesting point that I must emphasize here
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:51.680]   is this. It is not always when the Christian is praying for this particular blessing. That
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.120]   is where that incident in the fourth chapter of Acts that we read just now is such an interesting
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   one and important one. They rarely were not praying for another outpouring of the Spirit.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.800]   They were simply putting their case as it was into the hands of God and praying that
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   they might be continued and enabled to continue with their witness and their testimony. And
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.200]   as they were praying for that, God sent the blessing down upon them. And it has often
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.600]   happened like that. But it does happen often that while someone is actually praying for
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.960]   this blessing, the blessing is suddenly given. That is something that we would expect. While
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   engaged in prayer, either individual or collective, then another very common way is this. That
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   it is while one is reading the Scripture that this blessing suddenly comes. This is something
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.560]   again one would expect. The Holy Ghost is the author of the Scripture. It is he who
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.120]   inspired and guided and filled the men who have written these Scriptures. So there is
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:10.620]   this association inevitably between the Word and the coming of the Spirit. And what often
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.560]   happens is that the Christian is reading a portion of Scripture. He may have read it
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.800]   many, many times before. He may have read it hundreds of times. He has always enjoyed
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.480]   it. He has always had a blessing as he reads it. But suddenly, the Scripture seems to stand
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:38.120]   out. It is lifted out, and there it is, applied directly and immediately to him. Now, what
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.320]   happens is not so much that the man is again convinced of what he already knew and believed,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.400]   namely the way of salvation and the truth of the Gospel, but suddenly a Scripture is
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.280]   taken out and is given to him. As if an audible voice said, "It isn't an audible voice,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.560]   but it's equal to that. This is for you." The Scripture suddenly is given and applied
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:10.380]   directly to the soul. And the recipient knows this and is filled with the sense of rejoicing
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.720]   and of praise, which we have seen so many times in the Scriptures themselves and in
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:23.520]   the testimony of others throughout the centuries. So, if you are praying for this blessing and
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.640]   seeking it, asking and seeking and knocking, never be surprised that at some favoured moment
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.040]   while you are reading your Scriptures, he suddenly comes. This is the place to find
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   him. This is his. So keep with your Scriptures. Read your Scriptures. Read them in general.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.480]   Read about every aspect of salvation. You never know when, you never know where. There
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.040]   are no strict rules about this. You can't stereotype this blessing. The Spirit is free.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.600]   He is like the wind. He bloweth where he listers. And this is very true in this particular matter.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:13.440]   And then sometimes it happens while the Word is being preached in a service such as this.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   And that is what makes a service in the house of God so wonderful, so marvellous, and I
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.320]   use the word deliberately, so romantic. We have a right to expect that he should come
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.300]   when his people gather together to praise God and to worship him. Christian people,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:38.360]   you neglect the services of the house of God at your peril and to your great loss. That
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.560]   is to me the most wonderful thing. I have said it, I think, before. But as I walk up
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.960]   into this pulpit, this is to me the most wonderful thing in the whole of life. I never know what
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:58.680]   is going to happen. How often am I wrong in my anticipations, in both ways. Wrong in that
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.640]   something that I had expected doesn't happen, but thank God much more frequently, wrong
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.720]   in that my poor expectations have suddenly been falsified and God has suddenly been pleased
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:19.240]   to look upon us. Well now, how often has that happened in the past? While God's people
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.200]   are met together and the word is being expounded and unfolded. That's the way in which it
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   comes. And again, let me make this clear. The exposition needn't be about the Holy
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.360]   Spirit, it needn't be about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I think a number of friends
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.120]   need to be reminded of this at the present time. There is a danger that some people only
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.680]   speak and preach about the Holy Spirit, as if if you don't do that you'll never get
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.800]   this baptism. But if you read the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you must be struck
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.000]   at once that that isn't what they did. The early preachers preached about the Lord Jesus
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.400]   Christ. It is as they were preaching about him that the Spirit was sent, and of course
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   that's what you'd expect. Our Lord said, "He will not glorify himself, he will glorify
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   me." So if you really desire this blessing, concentrate on the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   it is so often, as men of God have been expounding the Scriptures and have been unfolding the
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.400]   Lord in the glory of his great salvation, that the Spirit has come and has set his seal
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:29.680]   upon it by baptizing men and women as they were listening to the message. Now that has
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   happened, I say again, so frequently. But you see, these ways are almost endless. Another
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:44.160]   way is this. That sometimes when the Christian is in a state of meditation, maybe thinking
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.400]   about these things, thinking about the spiritual life, thinking about the whole state of the
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:57.000]   church, mourning about its condition, and generally exercising himself in these matters,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.320]   not reading his Scriptures, not praying at the moment, but simply meditating. The lost
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.840]   art of meditation. Oh, as you read the biographies, you'll find that constantly coming in and
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.720]   constantly being emphasized. But we today, we are so busy, we are so active, we've
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.800]   got no time to think or to meditate, and that's why we often miss the blessing, meditation.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.120]   But as they're meditating, suddenly a Scripture is brought to the mind. They didn't think
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.560]   it. They were not seeking it. But suddenly a Scripture is brought to them, put before
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:40.580]   the mind, implanted in it almost, and suddenly it's applied to them. And when they least
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:48.120]   expected it, they are thus filled with a spirit of rejoicing and of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:56.840]   But – and I want to emphasize this last one also – sometimes this blessing is given
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   quite apart from the Scripture altogether. Now, I mean by that a direct and an immediate
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:11.600]   impression is made on our spirits by the Holy Spirit. I'm concerned to emphasize this
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.800]   for this reason, that those of you who have read the Puritans at all will have noticed
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:25.760]   that some of the Puritans, some of the leading ones at that, have often said and emphasized
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:33.000]   that the Spirit never comes in this way of blessing, of baptism, or of sealing, or of
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.440]   giving the earnest. He never does it, they say, apart from the Word. Now, I suggest that
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.600]   at that point they're going beyond the Scriptures, that there is no Scripture that says that,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.640]   and that furthermore they are denying what has so happened in the experiences of the
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.280]   saints throughout the centuries. Now, I understand quite easily why they did it. They did it
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.440]   for this reason. A man who tries to hold the balance of the Scripture always has to fight
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:11.680]   on two fronts, and many of these leading Puritans had to do that. They had to fight the Romanists
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.320]   and the dull formalists in Anglicanism. But on the other hand, there arose a number of
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:26.240]   wild, enthusiastic sects. Those who are familiar with the history of the seventeenth century
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.000]   will know what I mean, the Quakers and others, a kind of left wing in this matter. And these
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.480]   people went so far as to say you didn't need the Scriptures at all, that because of
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.720]   the inner light and the inner witness of the Spirit and the direct dealings of the Spirit
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:49.680]   of God, you didn't need the Word. Now, these main Puritans, in their desire to control
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.480]   that excess which they could see was going to do harm to the truth over and against the
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.760]   formalists, went so far as to say that you must never trust anything unless it comes
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:06.320]   directly with the Word. But that, it seems to me, as I say, is wrong, not only for the
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:13.720]   reasons that I've given, but for this further reason. These early Christians didn't have
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.760]   the Scriptures as we have them. They had their Old Testament Scriptures, but they hadn't
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:24.120]   got the New Testament Scriptures. How did they decide? How did it come to them? Now,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.840]   there is a danger then that we go too far and that we can set a limit upon the freedom
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:36.440]   of the Spirit and his sovereignty in his determination of the way in which he grants this particular
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:44.360]   blessing. So I am asserting that this blessing may come to the believer apart from the Word
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.600]   altogether, directly and immediately.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.680]   Now, let me, in order to support what I've just been saying, quote some words that were
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:03.600]   uttered by Charles Haddon Spurgeon on the 28th of April in 1861, on this very matter,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.880]   in a sermon that he preached on the subject of full assurance. Listen to him. "Beside
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:18.800]   this," he says, "God has a way of speaking without the Word and without the ministers
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.720]   to our hearts." He's saying, "God," he says, "beside this," he'd been dealing with preaching,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.120]   as I've been trying to do, he'd been dealing with reading the Word, and so on, he says,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.760]   "but beside this, God has a way of speaking without the Word and without the ministers
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:46.360]   to our hearts. His Spirit can drop like the rain and distill like the dew as the small
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:55.000]   rain upon the tender herb. We know not how it is, but sometimes there is a deep, sweet
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.320]   calm. Our conscience says, 'I have been washed in the blood of Christ,' and the Spirit of
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:13.000]   God says, 'Aye, 'tis true, 'tis true.' In such times we are so happy, so happy, that we want
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.280]   to tell our joy of so blessed that if we could but borrow angels' wings and fly away, we
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.160]   would scarce know the change when we were passed through the pearly gates. For we have
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.840]   had heaven below, and there has been but little difference between that and heaven above.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:41.640]   Oh, I wish that my whole congregation, without exception, consisted of men and women, would
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:52.280]   heard the Spirit say, 'I am thy salvation.' What happy hymns, what happy prayers! You
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.000]   might go home to some poor single room, you might go to a scantily furnished house, and
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.840]   to a table that has barely bread upon it. But happy men, happy men! Better would be
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:12.080]   you a dinner of herbs than a stalled ox without confidence in Christ. Better you a rich poverty
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.940]   than the poverty of the rich who have no faith in Jesus. Better all the griefs you have to
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:25.520]   endure when sanctified by assurance than all the joys the worldling has when unblessed
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:36.920]   by faith and unhallowed by love to God. I can say now, 'Grant me the visits of thy
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:46.560]   face, and I desire no more.' That's it. That's how Mr. Spurgeon put it. Without the
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:55.880]   word, without the preacher, but the Spirit suddenly, like the dew dropping and falling,
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.560]   suddenly he distills this and he speaks. The conscience says, 'I know that I am washed
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.000]   in the blood of the Lamb.' And the Spirit replies in an unmistakable manner, saying,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.040]   'Tis true, 'tis true.' That's it. It can happen then immediately and directly without
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.240]   the use of the word in that direct manner. Very well then, there, my friends, are some
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:30.280]   of the ways in which this happens. I'm saying this to encourage you. We dealt with the discouragement
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:39.200]   last Sunday. I'm saying this to encourage you. Sometimes a light surprises the Christian
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:47.160]   while he sings. It is the Lord who rises with healing in his wings. That's the glory, I
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.200]   say again, of this blessed life into which we've been brought. That you never know, there
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:59.400]   are surprises. You never know when, after rain, after storm. Well, let's go on. When
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.600]   is he given? That's the next point. I've dealt with the how, now let me deal for a moment
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:11.240]   with this when. When are we most likely to receive this blessing? When have we a right
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:18.360]   to expect it? Well, in addition to what I've just been saying, there are a number of points
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.840]   again which to me are most encouraging and are always most comforting. Once more, I would
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   emphasize the element of variableness. And that is where I so bemoan the teaching that
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.040]   has mechanized all this. You can't do that if you really believe your scriptures and
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.720]   if you know the long history of the Church in general and in the particular lives of
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   God's people. All the variety of the ways, all the variableness in his dealings. There's
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.440]   nothing fixed, set, stereotyped. That is again always the characteristic of the cults. Do
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.800]   this, there it is. That's not the freedom of the Spirit. And that is why I must issue
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:07.240]   that warning once more. But now there are certain chosen ways along which he comes.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:21.440]   Here is one. If you have truly mourned because of sin and because of your sinfulness, don't
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.760]   be surprised if the blessing is at hand. Now I mean really mourn because of your sinfulness.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.840]   How much of that is there today? It's not surprising that we've heard so little in
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.440]   this century about the baptism with the Spirit. It's not surprising that people should oppose
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:47.760]   it even, the teaching of this truth. You see, they know nothing about mourning for sin.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   Easy salvation, easy conversion, decision. But when you read the old biographies, you
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:01.200]   find men mourning because of their sin. John Bunyan, eighteen months in an agony of soul,
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.120]   and he's but one of many, many witnesses in this respect. Now I say it seems to be
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:14.080]   a rule that when a person has been led by the Spirit into this terrible mourning and
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.560]   grief because of sin, it's generally the prelude to the great release of the baptism
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.880]   of the Spirit. Now the Apostle Paul in a sense puts that to us, doesn't he, in the eighth
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.360]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans, where in the fourteenth verse he puts it like this.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.080]   "For," he says, "we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:41.320]   have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'" Now there is
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   a spirit of bondage to fear, and that is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:53.440]   cast a man down, as you see the Apostle Paul in Romans 7. He's beside himself, he doesn't
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.840]   know what to do. He says, "In me that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing."
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.080]   The Lord, he says, "is holy, but I am carnal, sold under sin." And he's in an agony and
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.960]   he's grieving. He's in bondage, a spirit of heaviness. And he can simply cry out, "Who
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.040]   shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Now a man who's ever had this terrible spirit
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:23.840]   of bondage is a man who is more likely than anybody else to have the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   The people who have never known a spirit of heaviness and of bondage are scarcely ever
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   able to testify to the baptism of the Spirit, and indeed are not interested. They think
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:41.080]   they've got everything. That's because of the superficiality of their whole position.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.880]   But the deeper you go in conviction and repentance and agony of soul, the more likely you are
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:53.200]   to be lifted up to the heights. I could give you endless illustrations of this. Was it
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.560]   last Sunday morning I was reminding you of how Whitefield and the Wesleys went through
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:04.360]   such an agony of repentance and conviction that it almost ruined their health? And then
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:12.320]   came the great and the blessed moment. Well, there is one. Here's another. A person who
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:21.400]   is led to some special act of self-denial in promoting God's glory is also on the way
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.640]   to this blessing. Now the Spirit leads us, as we saw last Sunday. And if he ever leads
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.000]   you to some act of special self-denial for the sake of God and his glory and his church
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:42.320]   and his cause, well, you can be confident that he's taking you along that road because
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.400]   he has this for you. Not that you're purchasing it by your act of self-denial, but in your
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   act of self-denial you have shown your readiness. As you remember, Abraham, when he's ready
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:02.160]   to offer his Isaac, receives again a great word with respect to the covenant. That's
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.560]   a good principle, again, on which you can work in your mind. And here's another one,
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:16.920]   and thank God for this. Those who have often had some special season of conflict with temptation
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:24.520]   in the devil have often found that that has been the prelude to the receiving of this
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:30.920]   great blessing. Now, we once dealt with this, what I called a satanic attack. You know,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.600]   the devil doesn't stop merely attempting people's deaths, as it were, his regular
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.640]   business. But there are times when he does with the Christian what he did with our Lord
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.120]   himself in the wilderness, made a special onslaught, attacks, satanic attack, massed
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:52.960]   his forces, as it were, and hounded the soul and pursued it. It happens almost invariably
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   that when a soul has passed through such a period of conflict with temptation and with
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.840]   Satan, that round the corner there awaits such a soul this great and mighty and delivering
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:13.320]   blessing. I'm simply saying these things for your comfort. If you feel that you are
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.040]   in this position, that things seem to be worse than they've ever been with you, and that
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.200]   you're having to fight for your very faith, well, I say, hold on, hold on. And it may
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:32.720]   be that just at the least suspected moment the Lord will pour forth his Spirit upon you
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.680]   to comfort you and to reward you and to gladden your heart.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.080]   Then another thing, and it follows from the last one, is this, and here is something again
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:50.160]   that is most interesting in the history of the Church. The blessing often comes in connection
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.000]   with some great trial. Now I don't mean temptation, now. I don't mean a satanic
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   attack. I'm thinking of trials in a more material sense and in a more external sense.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.960]   Often this has been associated with illness or with an accident or with disease of some
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.800]   kind. Those who've ever read the biography of the great Dr. Thomas Chalmers in Scotland
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.360]   will know that it was a long illness, when he was on his back for ten months or so, that
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   Thomas Chalmers really was blessed in this way and his whole ministry was completely
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:36.240]   transformed. But it's often happened in connection with circumstances, wars, and trials
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.080]   of that kind and description. I don't know whether you've ever thought of this. But
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.480]   you will often find that a country is visited with a revival before it has to face some
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:55.440]   great trial. There was a revival in Korea before they had their main troubles there,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.120]   back in 1906 and again after the last world war. And anybody who knows anything about
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.720]   the history of the Congo knows this. There was a remarkable revival in the Congo some
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.320]   ten years ago. The account was even written in a book. This is that. A great revival was
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:19.640]   given and you and I know what has happened subsequently. As if God is doing this special
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.080]   thing for his people before the time of crisis and of difficulty comes, in order to give
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:33.360]   them this consolation, in order to enable them to endure. I believe again that the incident
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.400]   in Acts 4 can be put into that particular category. You will often find, in other words,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.520]   that revivals have come before periods of testing and of trial. God is gracious and
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.200]   he is preparing his people for a testing. I believe the same thing can be said very
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.680]   much of Rwanda and Kenya before the troubles in connection with the Mau Mau there during
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.480]   the last ten years or so or once more. Well, there it is. Work that out for yourselves.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:12.080]   And then sometimes it happens like this. When God has got some special task for a Christian
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   to perform, he gives him this blessing. Why? Well, because he knows the man is inadequate,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:24.720]   he couldn't do it. And so there is nothing more interesting than to read the book of
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.480]   the Acts of the Apostles. You see, our Lord tells these apostles, "Tarry in Jerusalem.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.120]   I have taught you, I have instructed you, you have got all the knowledge, but you can't
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.600]   do this, you can't be witnesses unto me until you have been baptized with the Holy
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.880]   Ghost. So wait until then." And, of course, that is what you see throughout the running
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:52.080]   centuries. God, when he wants to use a man, he prepares him, he takes him through a process,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.600]   and then he gives him this authority, this power, this assurance, this certainty, and
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:03.200]   out he goes to perform the task to which God has called him and to which he has set him.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.400]   Now, this doesn't only apply to preachers. It is a task that devolves upon many of God's
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.720]   people who are not in the ministry as such or the all-time Christian work. But whenever
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.160]   God has a special work for somebody to do, he equips them, he gives them this endowment
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.920]   of power. You would expect that. And then, my final heading into this section is this.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:36.400]   And this, again, is the most remarkable thing. Sometimes this blessing is only given to God's
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:47.760]   people on their deathbed. You will find, those of you who are interested in old books, that
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:54.800]   the fathers, and I mean by that everybody until about eighty or ninety years ago, were
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:01.160]   very interested in the way in which people died. You very rarely hear anything about
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.960]   that now. You very rarely—in fact, I can't recall a single modern book that has dealt
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.280]   with this. But the fathers were tremendously interested in this, and rightly so. Of course,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.760]   it's such a tremendous thing. John Wesley used to boast about his people. He says, "Our
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:23.360]   people die well." And what a testimony that is to the truth of God and of Christ. And
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:32.880]   so it has often happened that people have only received this sealing, this blessing,
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:40.320]   this baptism, just before they entered into the glory. There was a notable man and preacher
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.120]   in America in the last century, by the name of Edward Pace. Godly man. He sought this
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:53.880]   blessing throughout his life. He only received it on his actual deathbed. And his account
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:00.240]   of it—I may quote it to you in a moment—is most remarkable. And he is one of many. As
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:06.280]   if again God was anxious to put his seal upon the faithful witness of this soul, and as
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   if he wants to give this longing soul a foretaste of the heaven which he is about to enter.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:20.320]   Here, you see, the ways are almost endless. We must be careful lest we restrict them,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:28.520]   or lest we try to systematize them of a much, or still more, lest we mechanize them. Because
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.640]   the moment you do that, you have lost the freedom of the spirit, and you are probably
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.080]   dealing with something spurious. Very well, let me come then to another section. How can
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.920]   it be known exactly when this has happened? Now, I have already partly answered that question
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:48.400]   weeks ago, when I gave some of the main results of the baptism with the Spirit. But let me
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.960]   just emphasize one aspect now. Again, we must be very careful that we do not standardize
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:59.640]   this. But here are some of the tests that you can apply. Let me give you a short word
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:07.720]   from a Puritan, a man by the name of Thomas Horton, writing in 1764. In 1664, I mean.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.160]   This man preached a great number of sermons on the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.720]   Romans. They were published in a huge volume. He puts it like this, "Whenever it comes
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.680]   in the reality and fullness of it, and so long as it remains upon the soul, it silences
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.240]   all objections, scatters all temptations, removes all scruples and doubts whatsoever
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:41.040]   to the contrary, and sets the heart at perfect rest, it is secret and inexpressible, certain
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:52.200]   and infallible." Has your heart ever been set at perfect rest? Have you known this luminosity,
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:36:01.160]   this clarity, when all scruples, doubts, hesitations, and objections are scattered? And your heart
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:08.720]   is at perfect rest. Secret, he says, and inexpressible. Certain and infallible. But let me quote to
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.880]   you Edward Payson, to whom I referred just now. This came to him when he was on his deathbed.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.840]   He didn't live very long afterwards. But this is how it happened. Somebody asked him,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:25.000]   "Do you feel reconciled?" You see, people used to put questions like that to one another
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.680]   in those days. When you visited a sick or a dying person, you didn't do your best to
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.800]   conceal it from them, and to talk about the weather or politics or everything else, you
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.280]   talked about the soul. People had made a claim, they said they'd believed. Well, if it doesn't
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.560]   help you in the hour of death, when's it going to help you? What's gone wrong with us Christian
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.360]   people? What's gone wrong with us evangelical people? Somebody, you see, said to him, "Do
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:56.920]   you feel reconciled?" "Oh," said Edward Payson, "that is too cold. I rejoice, I triumph, and
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:04.200]   this happiness will endure as long as God himself, for it consists in admiring and adoring
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:13.800]   him." That's it, that's the test. I can find no words to express my happiness. I seem to
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:23.280]   be swimming in a river of pleasure, which is carrying me on to the great fountain. That's
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:32.200]   it, Christian people. This is something inexpressible, something given, and you can only describe
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.160]   it in terms of superlatives. Let me deal with a final problem for this morning, the durability
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:45.080]   of this experience. And incidentally, let me say that I'm hoping to deal again with
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.440]   some of these difficulties next Sunday morning, and to bring this series to a conclusion on
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.720]   which Sunday morning. But let us now look for a moment at this question of the durability
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:38:00.320]   of this experience. Now, here again, the thing that strikes us above everything else is the
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:09.840]   variety and the variableness. There is nothing so fatal in this matter than to have it cut
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:16.840]   and dried and documented, this, that, must. No, no, there's infinite variety because it's
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.800]   the liberty of the Spirit. But I would say, in general, that this is not permanent. I
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:29.720]   mean this experience is not permanent. It tends to pass. Now, here is something I must
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:37.320]   say. It is sometimes the case that people have had this experience once only, and never
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:46.520]   again. But the memory of it has remained with them all their lives, as long as they lived,
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.520]   as the most wonderful and the most glorious thing they'd ever known. Now, I happen to
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:59.680]   have known a man who was a perfect illustration of this. He was a minister, and I knew him
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.560]   first of all some twenty-three years after this great experience came to him. He was
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:13.000]   then a ministerial student in 1904, at the time of the Welsh revival of 1904 and five.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.040]   He was a student in the Theological College with a number of other students. The lecturer
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.600]   that morning was the principal of the college, and he was giving one of his lectures. He
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.120]   was giving a course of lectures on the doctrine of the atonement. You see, he wasn't lecturing
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.320]   on the Holy Spirit. He wasn't lecturing on tongues. He wasn't lecturing on gifts.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.120]   He was lecturing on the doctrine of the atonement. And the students had gone there that morning
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:43.240]   as they've gone every other morning. This man, he told me the story many times. I asked
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:49.880]   him to repeat it many times, because it was so wonderful. And all he had to say was this,
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:56.920]   that he remembers the lecture starting somewhere about ten o'clock in the morning. But the
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.680]   next thing he remembers was about one o'clock, he found himself on his knees in one of the
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.400]   corners of the room. He looked round, the other men were all on their knees and they
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.880]   were all praying. He remembers the joy that was in his own heart. He remembers the expression
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.800]   on the faces of his fellow students. There was something of the glory in their faces,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.280]   shining. Nobody knew exactly what had happened, but that is what had happened. The Spirit
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   had suddenly come down upon them, and he was transported, taken out of himself. In a sense,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.160]   at last his consciousness was taken out of time, and was filled with this great spirit
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   of freedom and rejoicing and praise in his praying in particular, and it lasted for months.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.720]   And then it went. And as I say, I met this man twenty-three years later. I found his
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:00.000]   ministry a barren one. And all he could do was this, was to tell us about this experience.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.720]   And when he did so, he became transformed for the time being. And his great longing
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:11.680]   and desire was that he might know this again. He never did. Now, that is one instance. But
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.840]   you see, the memory of that had carried this man through the period of barrenness and of
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:25.000]   trial. It can be that. In other words, this is an experience that can be lost. If you
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.040]   grieve the Holy Spirit, you will lose it. There is no question about this. It has happened
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.840]   to many a man. Many men have been blessed like this and filled with the Spirit. They
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.680]   have fallen into sin. They have lost the joy, the peace, the agony of soul comes back to
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.440]   them, and they are in great trouble. They still know they are Christians, although at
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:53.480]   times they are tempted even to doubt that, because they have lost this.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:01.360]   But I want to hasten to say this. You can lose it, but thank God you can receive it
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:08.640]   again. There is no limit. You can be blessed again. It can be repeated many times. Did
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.400]   you notice that the people of whom we were reading in Acts 4 were the same people that
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.120]   you read of in Acts 2? The apostles and these others that were now part of the company.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.360]   They were filled on the day of Pentecost, but they were filled again on this other occasion.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.440]   The same people. This can happen many, many times. It is so wrong to say that it is once
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:39.000]   and forever. No, no. It can be repeated. You read the journals of Whitefield, and you will
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.960]   find that this happened to him many times. He always lived on a high level, but there
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.920]   were moments when he was transported into the heavens. He did not remain there. He came
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.640]   back again. Then he would be taken up again. Repeated many, many times. And this is true
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.920]   of many others. If you know anything about the Methodist revival in Wales two hundred
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:07.240]   years ago, you will know that after the tremendous movement and excitement from 1735 to 1750,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:14.120]   under the great Daniel Rowlands even, from 1751 to 1762, there was scarcely a move. He
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.280]   was still a great preacher. He still preached with great authority and power. But there
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:24.640]   was no freedom. There was no abandon. But again, at the end of 1662, back it all came.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.240]   A spirit of rejoicing and of praise, and it continued with occasional intermissions until
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:37.040]   his death in 1791. And perhaps most remarkable of all, the very news of the death of Daniel
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:44.160]   Rowland led to another outpouring. So this can be repeated. Do not take it for granted,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.700]   my dear friend, that if you have lost something, you have lost it forever. No, no. The blessing
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:53.880]   can be repeated if you truly seek it. Do not feel you have sinned against the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:59.040]   Do not feel that it is once and forever. No, no. Seek it. Go back. You can have it many,
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:05.320]   many times. Now let me again, as I close, just substantiate this with some quotations.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.560]   A man by the name of Joseph Smith of Charleston in the United States preached a sermon on
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.280]   George Whitefield, and amongst other things he said this. He was a man who knew Whitefield
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:21.440]   intimately. He said, "He, Whitefield, renounced all pretensions to the extraordinary powers
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:27.360]   and signs of apostleship, gifts of healing, speaking with tongues the faith of miracles,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.280]   things which Joseph Smith regards as peculiar to the age of inspiration and extinct wisdom."
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.360]   Do not worry about that. We disagree with him there. He is simply saying what he regarded
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:44.320]   as a fact. He then says, "Whitefield also allowed that these feelings of the Spirit
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:54.880]   were not in every person, or at all times, and in the same degree." That is the substantiation
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.200]   of what I have just been saying. Not in everybody, not in any person at all times, not in any
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:09.320]   person always to the same degree. "And that their full assurance were attainable, and
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:18.480]   what every one should labor to attain, yet not of absolute necessity to the being of
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.280]   a Christian." That is what Whitefield taught regularly in his ministry in this country
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.240]   and in America. In other words, you can be a Christian without this, but you should seek
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:34.320]   it and labor to attain it, every one.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.680]   Listen to Philip Dobridge. You know the man who has written some of these great hymns
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:45.760]   that we sing, "O God of Bethel, by whose hand thy people still are fed," and so on.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:52.680]   He puts it like this. And I judge it the more necessary to expatiate upon that thought,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:46:00.000]   because the devil sometimes takes an advantage to bring all into doubt and to raise a storm
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.640]   in the soul, merely on account of the cessation of these extraordinary experiences.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.240]   Well, here was a wise pastor. He knew that many people who had had a great experience
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240]   and then seemed to have lost it, the devil took advantage and created a great storm in
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:23.000]   the soul, trying to make them doubt even whether they were Christians at all. Now, Dobridge
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.120]   goes on to say, "These things were never intended as our daily food, but only as the
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:39.040]   rich dainties with which our heavenly Father thinks fit now and then to delight the souls
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.320]   of his children and to make, as it were, a feast for them."
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.000]   "This isn't food," says Dobridge. "This is some special dainty. This is a special
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.400]   feast. This is a kind of birthday party that God in his infinite grace gives to his children
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.760]   now and again. So if it goes, don't feel that you're not a Christian. Don't let
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:04.400]   the devil get an advantage over you. This is not food. These are dainties prepared by
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.640]   the heavenly Father in his love for us."
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.480]   And let me end with a quotation from J. C. Philpott, one of the founders of the strict
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:19.360]   Baptist, you know, with William Tiptoe, J. C. Philpott. This is how he puts it. "Those
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:28.440]   who enjoy it," he's referring to this experience, "have it only at favored moments and peculiar
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:38.200]   seasons. If once enjoyed, they cannot lose the recollection of it. But they may and do
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:45.360]   lose the enjoyment and through temptation and desertion sink into those dark and miserable
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:51.560]   spots where nearly all seems lost and gone."
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:59.080]   You see, this is the testimony of these men of God in different ages, in different circumstances,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:06.480]   and in different places and times. They all agree that it may be lost, but it can again
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:14.320]   be obtained. But this is the universal testimony. Once a man has known this, he is never the
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:21.800]   same again. Whatever may happen to him, whatever trials may beset him, whatever desertions
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:31.480]   he may know, the recollection of this is as an anchor of the soul, something never to
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:38.800]   be forgotten. Well, my dear friends, there it is, those are some of the ways in which
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.760]   this blessing comes, the times at which you are entitled to expect it, its character,
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:52.640]   its nature, and this variable element in connection with it. You see, it all comes from this.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:49:01.120]   This is the lordship of the Lord Christ himself. You can't hold this. It's given, it's
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:09.160]   given. We can but go on to seek his face, to rejoice before him, to seek his glory,
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:17.480]   and to ask him to seal all the promises to us, to grant us this blessed baptism, especially
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:23.160]   at an evil time like this, to fill us with such power and authority and assurance that
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:30.440]   our word shall indeed go out as the word of God, and many shall be humbled at hearing
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:40.040]   it, and brought to seek salvation, and then to know this blessed assurance that Jesus
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:50.520]   is there. Amen.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.360]   The following hymn is a hymn that expresses a good deal of this, again by William Cowper,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:04.320]   like our previous hymn, hymn number 476. "Oh, for a closer walk with God, a calm and heavenly
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:11.080]   frame." He knew this variation. He knew this losing and receiving as scarcely others perhaps
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:35.080]   have ever known. 476.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:51.880]   "Oh, for a closer walk with God, a calm and heavenly frame. A light to shine upon the
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:51:20.120]   world, a light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:48.760]   upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:52:17.400]   to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:46.040]   A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:53:15.960]   the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to shine upon the world. A light to
