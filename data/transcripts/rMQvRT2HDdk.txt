[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Proud people don't say thanks.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   That was the title of Pastor John's Thanksgiving sermon way back in 1983.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Yes, 30 years ago.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And with Pastor John on the final leg of his trip through the Middle East,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   today on the Ask Pastor John podcast we're doing something totally different.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   We're digging back into the sermon archive to resurface a clip from that sermon in 1983.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   This sermon is based on Romans chapter 1, verses 16 to 23,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and it's a passage worth reflecting on annually when Thanksgiving comes around.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Here's a brief clip of what Pastor John had to say in that message 30 years ago.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So for those who love the truth, creation becomes a dazzling lesson book in theology.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It teaches the open mind that there is a deity,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   an infinitely marvelous being who made the world and everything in it.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   It teaches that this being has stupendous power and that the power is eternal.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   The world in its molecular and visual and galactic order and structure bears witness to an architect.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And if that architect made everything that is, then he himself was not made, but must have been always and is eternal.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   An eternally powerful, infinitely marvelous maker of all things is evident in the lesson book of creation.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And that's not all you can learn from the lesson book of creation.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   If, in fact, there is an all powerful, infinitely marvelous maker of all things,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   then I know something very personal.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   He made me.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And everything I have, I have from his hand as a free gift.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I am made creature, utterly dependent.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And everything that I enjoy is a gift from the hand of an all powerful creator.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I stand before the irresistible logic of the lesson book of creation,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and I have to admit that everything without exception is a free gift.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And that has tremendous implications.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's inconceivable that the creator should ever owe me anything.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It is inconceivable that a creature should be owed anything by his creator.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   For when could I have ever given anything to God which was not his, so that then he would owe me back?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   For from him and through him and to him are all things, the apostle says.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I am not my own.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I belong to another.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Creation, on the one hand, testifies that we are creatures, that God is all glorious, eternally powerful,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and we should cherish him and give him continual and heartfelt thanks day and night.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   But for some mysterious reason, every single human heart hates that message and therefore suppresses it with all its might.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Or as verse 25 says, we exchange the truth about God for a lie.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Here, I'll trade. Give me your lie, I'll give you the truth of creation.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And the reason I think we do that is because the truth of creation is humiliating.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   From sea to shining sea, creation shouts that God has eternal power, God is infinitely glorious,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   God made me and everything I enjoy, and as for me, what is left for me?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Just humbly thank the Lord, just give him glory through gratitude.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's all that's left for you.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Gratitude as a recipient, always a recipient, but proud people don't say thanks.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Gratitude is the echo of grace reverberating through the hollows of the heart, but proud people don't need grace.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And proud people have all the hollows of their heart crammed full up with wisdom.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Claiming to be wise, they exchange the glory of the immortal God for images.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Proud people don't say thanks.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Tight-lipped, they take the diamond of God's glory, enter into the pawn shop of pride,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   hock it for the broken marble of self-reliance, and then they go home and they put their little marble
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   with its cat's eye and cracks on the mantle of their mind and find one hundred ways every day to bow down to that idol.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   My desire for you this morning is your gratitude.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Proud people don't say thanks.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I want you to have the deepest, most authentic, most joyful thanksgiving of your life on Thursday.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Nothing less.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And the reason it can be, in spite of your and my miserable failure to thank God as we ought day in and day out,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   is because of this gracious word from our Father in Heaven.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I dwell in a high and holy place and with him who is of a broken and contrite spirit,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   to revive the heart of the contrite and to revive the spirit of the humble.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   There's our hope. Nowhere else.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   For the true child of God, the repeated discovery of sin in his life leads to grief,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   which produces repentance, which leads to salvation, which brings no regret, according to the apostle in 2 Corinthians 7.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Have you never been driven to tears precisely because you are forgiven?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I pray that there will be great, heartfelt thanksgiving to God in all your homes this week.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I hope that some of you sing in the garage for the first time, or the shower,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   someplace where nobody can hear that awful voice, just God in his delight,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   taking in a song of thanksgiving that rises up out of a broken, contrite, forgiven spirit.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I hope some of you write poems of thanksgiving to share with your families this week.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I hope some of you write in your journal prayers of praise.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I hope some of you make long lists on white paper of the hundreds of blessings that God has brought you
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   in spite of your sin, and which he will continue to bring.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And I hope that some of you spend very special times with God,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and I hope that some of you say to wife or husband or a very special friend, eyeball to eyeball,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "I thank God for you."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We need to say a lot of that this week, OK?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But proud people don't say thanks, and therefore I have tried to lay before you three very humbling truths this morning.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   One, the lesson book of creation teaches that there is an eternally powerful, all-glorious being who made me, made you,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and everything you enjoy is a free gift, not something that you have earned.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And our duty, therefore, is simply to glorify him by giving thanks from hearts of deep gratitude.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And the second truth is that none of you ever do that like you should.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   An infinite God with infinite mercy and infinite beneficence is worthy of the intensest,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   most consistent, heartfelt gratitude and love and devotion every day, all day long,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   that any human can possibly give.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Is there anybody in here who does that?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We sin every day.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   We are sinners.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The purity of spirit is not something to be left behind.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   We have no choice if we're honest.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   We must be broken and contrite in spirit.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And the third humbling truth is this.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Almighty God, our creator, in the great love with which he loved us, sent Jesus Christ into the world to endure your judgment,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   the judgment of those who are broken and contrite in spirit and look away from themselves to him for hope.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Proud people don't say thanks, but people who believe those three truths say thanks.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And they don't just say thanks, they feel thanks from the bottom of their heart.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The truth that we are utterly dependent creatures, the truth that we are depraved in our condition,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and the truth that we are forgiven by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And if those three truths will penetrate your heart this morning, if you'll open yourselves to them and welcome them,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   then they will empty you of pride.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And you know what will happen tonight?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You will be filled from the bottom to the brim with tremendous thanksgiving.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Vintage John Piper. I love that early preaching voice.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   This clip was taken from a sermon, "Proud People Don't Say Thanks," which he preached at Bethlehem Baptist Church back in November of 1983.
