[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Great.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The course has raised some questions for me,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   mainly about citizenship and residency.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   If you don't mind, I'd like to give you a little bit of background
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and then ask you a couple questions.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Sure.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   First of all, I'm a Canadian citizen.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm married to an American.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We're both in our very early 50s.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We would like to retire within the next year.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   On the last part.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   My husband has an adult daughter from a previous marriage.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   [inaudible]
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Last seven years.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I make it back to Canada twice a year to visit family and friends.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I have a couple of Canadian bank accounts, but no other ties to Canada.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   My mother, my father, my sibling have all passed,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   so they are no dependent for me and really no one to look after back in Canada.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   With every passing year, I become more disenchanted with the situation in Canada.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   More oppression, higher cost of living.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I can't believe I'm saying this, but I doubt I would ever move back.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is my question.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   After living in the States for the last 10 years,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm wondering if I should become a US citizen.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   There's downsides.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I'm trying to think of the upsides.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   For me, the upsides are that I have a business in the US
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and so does my husband who's in real estate.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It's my impression that citizenship may provide some security that residency doesn't
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   because I have to renew my residency every decade.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   One is an uninterrupted income.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This might just be an assumption.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's my sense that we can continue to operate in the United States,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   make US dollars, and live abroad.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I don't know that if we are earning our US dollars in Idaho,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   would we still be taxed because that's American earned income,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   even though we're living abroad.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Another one is -- I guess I should break it down into some manageable questions,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   but freedom.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I like to travel.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   This is probably the big push for me is that it's my understanding if I'm out of
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the country more than six months of the year, I lose my residency status.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   My goal is to be able to travel frequently and a lot and not be encumbered by these rules.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Okay.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That's the benefits to me, the big benefits of getting citizenship.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Also, if my husband passes away, he's American, and there's no sign of that happening.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   But I've always felt a little insecure, like would I be able to continue to live in the US?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   What if they didn't renew my residency?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   We have a home here.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   We have pets.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   We have -- you know, he has pension and Social Security benefits, and we have assets here.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So I just feel like my -- it would be more tenuous if he were to pass away,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and I weren't a citizen.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So those are -- those are I guess are my big concerns right now.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   But becoming a citizen means taxation for the rest of my life.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And, you know, I don't really like that idea.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I mean, right now we both have to file taxes together.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But just if he were to pass away and I decided I didn't want to live in the US anymore,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   now I'm still filing a tax return for the rest of my life.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So are there any other downsides you can think of?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Let me ask the question, and you just started to lead into it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   There are many people around the world who would dearly love to be US citizens.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Why would you not want to be a US citizen?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Yeah, I think for me it's a big thing is the tax thing.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And it's really just -- I mean, not like I'm expecting him to pass away,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   but I really don't like the idea of having to file a tax return for the rest of my life
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   if I chose not to live in the US.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   We are like currently pursuing residency in Mexico, part-time only at the moment.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But maybe one day we might want to be full-time.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   You know, anyway.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So at the moment you don't have any clear plans or any strong dreams,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you and he, to live outside the United States.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But you do enjoy traveling abroad, but you don't have any plans to move abroad.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Is that right?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Not at this time.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   But I should say he is pursuing his Greek citizenship through his mother,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   who was born in Athens.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We've always enjoyed Europe.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Great.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But we don't have any plans to move to Europe at this point.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Right.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And at the beginning of your call, the connection wasn't great.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It may be on my end, but I didn't want to mess it up just in case in the call.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   What is the nature of your business or income?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So he currently is employed, and he also gets income from rental properties.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I am self-employed with an escort in Idaho.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I work online as a health coach, and I've been in business since 2018 here.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Okay.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And about just Ballpark, what is your household income?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And Ballpark, what is your current net worth?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Our current net worth is about $700,000, and the Ballpark --
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   my business hasn't done great this year.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So I would say it has fluctuated with his income between $200,000 and $280,000 a year.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Okay.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   So all of the benefits that you mentioned of becoming a U.S. citizen are true.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   While you are a long-term resident of the United States,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   you don't have the same security of being able to stay in the United States forever,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   no matter what, as you would have if you were a citizen.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And of particular import is what you said about being gone a lot,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   is that if you wanted to maintain the United States as your home forever,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   that was your clear plan, but you also wanted to go and travel abroad continually
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   for the next five years, you would have probably a problem with your residency visa
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and your ability to renew it, because there are not insignificant physical presence
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   requirements of you in the United States.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's not as clear-cut as the Canadian physical presence requirements are
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   for people with a Canadian residence permit,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   but there are physical presence requirements.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Whereas if you were a citizen, you could acquire your citizenship,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   you could move abroad for 20 years, and you don't even need to keep anything current,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   you don't even need to do anything.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   If you want to prove I'm a citizen, when you come back, get yourself back to the border,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   then by law you are required to be allowed in.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And so that, for many people, can be a significant factor,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and that does affect quite a lot of people.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Where I've seen this the most is, you know, I worked with a client of mine one time
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   who was from Brazil, and his mother had a Brazilian residency visa,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and she had moved abroad for a number of years and then wanted to move back
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   to the United States.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And so she had a visa, and yet just when she left, she just left,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and then in her case she was able to go back,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but that's where you don't always have that security,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   is that if you're a resident, you always have to go through some formalities
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   to maintain that permission, whereas a citizen does not have that.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And it sounds to me like that would be a very valuable piece of mind.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I also think that many people underappreciate the value of U.S. citizenship
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   as an incredible plan B, especially in the internationalization space.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   As I have wrestled with this myself over the years,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   wrestling with the idea of, "Would I renounce my citizenship?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Could I? Would I? Should I?" etc.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Where I came to more confidence in the fact that I probably will never
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   renounce my citizenship was when I realized how much time and money
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I was spending wandering around the world, putting in place all these other things.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And basically every other flag that I have, while I've worked hard to put in place
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   some of the best ones, and I've spent a lot of money and a lot of time to do it,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   they all pale in comparison compared to the value of my American flags,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   of all the things that I have.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   The United States has so many benefits going for it.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Everything from just the fact that if I'm an American citizen,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I have the right legally to work in the United States.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's basically impossible for me to consider, unless I were disabled
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and unable to work, or incarcerated, or something like that.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   It's basically impossible for me to consider being impoverished.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And that is a tremendous thing, to know that I could access the U.S. job market
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   with no problem and be able to support my family.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   What an incredible foundation for my financial life and my confidence.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Every other aspect of it, the food security of the United States,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   the agricultural productivity, the general diversity of the society,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   the fact that there are so many corners where I can go and I can fit in,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and I can find my people, and I can live a quiet and happy and safe and peaceful life, etc.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   The United States is the world's greatest plan B.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   If there were one nation, only one nation, that I could spend time in
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and be in for the rest of my life, it would be the United States.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   To me, there's no question about that.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And so, as I've looked at that, I've realized,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   "Well, if I'm going to spend thousands of dollars each year
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   to maintain this other residency, why would I not be willing to maintain
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   the United States stuff as a great backup plan, even if it is a hassle?"
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Yes, it's a hassle for me to fill out a tax return every year.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Of course it's a hassle.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It's a hassle for me to maintain all the data, etc.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Of course it's a hassle.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   But why would I not be willing to do that?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And you mentioned the taxation issue.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   The taxation issue is true, but it is really only true for those
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   who have very high levels of income, and that income is the kind of income
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   that can't most effectively...
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   It's the kind of income that can be done from any marketplace.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So, if you have a household income of $200,000 or $300,000
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and you want to live completely income tax-free,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   you can do that easily with a household income of a few hundred thousand dollars
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   with the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It's easy to do that.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And beyond that, you can cut your tax rates massively,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   just even far beyond that.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Now, on the other hand, if you're making, say, $10 million a year,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and that $10 million a year is something that's generated with earned income,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and it's something that you can easily do from anywhere in the world,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   now all of a sudden writing a check every year for a couple million dollars
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   to a country that you don't particularly feel all that enthusiastic about,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   to me that's a much bigger ask.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Now it becomes much more probable that you would want to move abroad--
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   sorry, excuse me, that you would want to lower your income.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And similarly with investments,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   since you cannot eliminate your investment taxes
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   by moving outside of the United States for U.S. citizens,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   if you had substantial investment income
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   and that investment income couldn't be sheltered
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   using some of the other systems that are out there,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   then certainly you would consider not being a U.S. citizen.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   But with what you've described, with about a $700,000 net worth,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and the nature of the income that you described,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   with a W-2 employee plus rental income--
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   your taxation on the rental income doesn't change by being abroad--
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   the W-2 employee, you could change some income taxes for your husband,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   depending on what he could negotiate with his company.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You could change taxes, but you're not--
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   unless you saw your income going to a million dollars a year,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   to me this doesn't seem like a big concern.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I also don't think that any of this is permanent.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So if you wanted to become a U.S. citizen,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   and you became a U.S. citizen,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and then five years from now you chose to renounce your U.S. citizenship,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   you would have slightly more hassle--
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I'm thinking for a moment--
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   no, you wouldn't have any more hassle
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   because permanent residents are still subject to the exit taxes.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So it basically would be the same.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So in your situation, from what you're describing to me,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I would see many more benefits to your being a U.S. citizen
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   rather than significant downsides.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And then if the downsides approached, you're not stuck.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   You would have all the same exit possibilities
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   that a U.S. citizen would have, and more.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   So let's fast forward. Let's say it's five years in the future.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Your business has taken off massively,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   and you just get tired of the paperwork.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And now you and your husband are Greek citizens,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   you're Canadian citizens, you're American citizens,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and you've set up a beautiful little house
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   wherever you happen to want to be.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And you're living in a tax haven,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   or you're doing something that's a very tax-efficient lifestyle,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   and you decide, "We're done with it."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Well, in that situation, you could just easily renounce your citizenship.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And by the way, I would say you probably could go either way.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So in my thinking--and I've had a very hard time verifying some of this legally,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   because I haven't spent a lot of money for lawyers on this,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and my ability to do legal research is limited--
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   but I've always thought of it basically like this.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   First of all, the benefit of your not being a U.S. citizen--
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   to flip around to the other perspective and make sure you understand it clearly--
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   your benefit of your not being a U.S. citizen from a tax perspective
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   is that you and your husband could have a business together.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   He could maintain his citizenship.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   You, being a Canadian citizen, could do business in a tax haven,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and all of your income for you as a non-citizen
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   could be structured to be tax-free.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And as the spouse of a non-U.S. citizen person,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   you have an unlimited ability to transfer your money between the two of you.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And so that structure, with one spouse being a U.S. citizen
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   and one spouse not being a U.S. citizen,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   can be simultaneously a fantastic tax structure
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   if there's trust and confidence and you're not getting divorced,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   while also giving you easily the ability to access the United States in the future
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   if you wanted to, because he could always apply for you for a spousal visa,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and you could move to the United States and again enroll in the U.S. tax system.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So that's always how I've thought about it,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   is that if I renounced my citizenship at some point,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I would be the one who would do it.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   My wife would keep hers, my children would keep theirs,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and now I can earn as much money as I want,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   my family can have all their things covered,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   but they have the choice to choose in the future.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   But I just don't see that as, unless there's something
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   that you would expect to change with your own situation,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I don't see that as being of primary importance,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and I don't see any of this as irrevocable.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So as far as I can tell, and this question bugged me for years,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   as far as I can tell, there's no law that would say
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   that if you became a citizen, and then you renounced your citizenship,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and then five years later you wanted to apply for a spousal visa,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   there's no law in place that would say that you couldn't apply for a spousal visa
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   and go through the whole process again.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I don't know if there's discrimination,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I would guess there probably is some discrimination for that kind of situation.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   - Yes, I would tell.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   - But I can't find any law that would say that that can't be done.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And if anyone knows differently, just let me know.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So I guess the point is that from what you described,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   unless there's some reason why you think your financial situation
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   would change and justify it, I think having full and unfettered access
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   to the United States as a world-class backup plan,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and also the fact that it's your home,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   and having that security for you if your husband did die
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   or something like that, to me sounds like worth having.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   - I appreciate that, Joshua.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I think one of my values is freedom,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   so the idea of just being beholden for taxes for the rest of my life,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   but you make it an option to be able to renounce,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   although I hear it's getting harder to renounce.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They change the fee from $1,000 to $5,000, and it's getting harder,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   but then it may get harder again in the future.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   But right now, it feels like the best course of action to get citizenship,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   pros and cons to everything.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   - There are, and it's an infuriating decision.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And I have many times been jealous of people like Canadians
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   because it feels that the whole world of getting U.S. citizenship
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   or renouncing U.S. citizenship feels like such an all-encompassing decision.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And it's like, why should a country have this much control over you?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Why can't you just say, "I really value this country and this connection,"
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   and then make my choice based upon what the country has to offer to me
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   at that particular time?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But I can't see any hope of that changing within my lifetime.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   - Do you have time for a quick question about the foreign income?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Go ahead.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   - So I work remotely and entirely online, so I can work anywhere in the world.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   But if I am registered as an S-Corp, and I'm based in the LSU, Idaho,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and I'm earning this income, if at the point where we're no longer living
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   in the United States, would that qualify for the exemption?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Or do I still have to pay because I'm still earning dollars in the U.S. technically?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   - So a lawyer would always say it's complicated, because it is,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   because there's all kinds of connections as far as what kind of work
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   are you doing, etc.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   But because of the way the foreign earned income exclusion is structured,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   it's much, much simpler than any other country's tests.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   For example, it doesn't matter where you sell your products.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So you could have all of your customers could be in the United States,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   and that would be no problem.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   The foreign earned income exclusion is based upon where--so there's two tests.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   So number one, it's that your tax home must be in a foreign country.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   That word "tax home," what does that mean?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Well, basically, as best I can tell, a tax home is your main place of business
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   or employment or where you conduct your work.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so that's the fuzzy one, but as far as I can tell,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   there's not much testing on that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And then when you get to the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   how you qualify, there's two tests.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   There's the bona fide residence test, and then there's the physical presence test.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So let's just keep it simple and say that you qualify for the physical presence test.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And let's pretend you spend zero days inside the United States.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Well, your qualification is easy and automatic in that circumstance.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   So now you can exempt your first $120,000 from the taxes.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   The only wrinkle comes is that's only for your income taxes.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So you could have your Idaho corporation, and that Idaho corporation will pay you your salary.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   But because you yourself qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   your Idaho salary is exempt from taxation because you're under the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's excluded from taxation.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It doesn't matter where your customers are.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It doesn't matter where your clients are.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   It doesn't matter where even your business is.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It's you yourself are abroad.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   That wouldn't be the case for things like dividends.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   So this is for earned income only.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So if you had a lot of dividends or royalties or some other form of income,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   that is not affected by the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Now, the second component of it involves your wage taxes,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   your self-employment taxes or your employment taxes.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And that for most people at the levels that we're talking about is usually a bigger factor.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Your income taxes, your federal income taxes on $120,000 of income are generally pretty modest
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   if you have any deductions or exclusions whatsoever.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   It's just pretty modest for many people.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Not if you don't have children or not if you have other income sources,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   but there's so much that you can be done.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So at that level of income, it's actually your employment taxes that become a bigger deal.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So on $100,000, it's 15.3%.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   So $15,300 on $100,000.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Now, you can get rid of that by then putting in place a foreign corporation.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And so the normal structure is that you would have a foreign corporation that you own,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and then your foreign corporation would own in the United States a single-member LLC.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And for the IRS, a single-member LLC is a disregarded entity.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   It doesn't exist from a tax perspective,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   but it still allows you to run all your business through that entity in the United States.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And then you yourself are an employee of the foreign corporation.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   So that's a simple structure that works well, but it does add cost and complexity.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   You have to file some extra tax returns every year,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and you have several thousand dollars of just maintenance costs of maintaining the structure.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And you lose out on your contributions to the Social Security system.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So that also in many cases is not a great idea because you might want to collect those credits,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and they may be very helpful for you in your overall planning,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   especially if you yourself came in late into that system.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Then you might want to accumulate those credits so that you have full coverage in the Medicare system
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and that you have a Social Security benefit that can help protect for your financial security.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   But did I answer your question? I think I did.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   You did, yeah.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   So obviously there's a tipping point because on $100,000, $15,000,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   it could be a wash with the extra taxation and filing and accounting help,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and then you lose out on Medicare and all that stuff.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So yeah, I think there'd be a tipping point.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I need – it sounds like I need a tax accountant for this type of thing when the time comes.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I guess if I had to say what I have learned over the years, I have been a very enthusiastic tax researcher.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   I have enjoyed doing everything I can to get taxes to zero, et cetera.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Over the years, I've realized that I just don't think it's wise for anybody
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   to put taxes as a primary reason for doing anything.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   If you move from a place that you love where you pay high taxes
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and you move to a place that you hate just so you can pay zero taxes,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   that is not a recipe for success, especially when we're talking about income taxes.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Income taxes in the United States are generally low for people who are low and modest income earners.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   If you're a high income earner, then income taxes are high.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   But then you have to ask yourself the question,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   did I get rich and start making a high income so that I could make all my decisions about taxes,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   or do I want the freedom to live how and where I want?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I think it's ironic that a lot of people who are the most enthusiastic –
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   or excuse me, the most vocal pursuers of freedom,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   of saying, "I want to live free, I want to live free," et cetera,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   often wind up having their decision choices made by a dogged pursuit of zero taxes or something like that.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It doesn't seem really free to me.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   So I look at taxes as an important secondary criteria.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's primarily best to think about how and where do I want to live,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and then let me be aware of the tax system and ask myself,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   would I rather make certain trade-offs based upon this tax jurisdiction or that tax jurisdiction, et cetera?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Are there low tax jurisdictions that are attractive to me?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Can I structure my affairs in a way that without too much frustration,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I live a relatively low tax lifestyle?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And I think that there are many cases in which it can be done.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   So taxes are a very important secondary consideration, or maybe like a lower tier primary,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   but I don't think they should in any way ever be the primary consideration that drives your life decisions.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And if they are, then I think you wind up being unhappy with that after a few years.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I 100% agree.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I was just wondering if there's any other drawbacks to becoming a U.S. citizen that I'm missing
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   other than the fact that I could be taxed for the rest of my life unless I went out.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But you didn't bring any other drawbacks up.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   So I appreciate your analysis of the situation very much, and I know what to do now.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   So thank you for your time, Joshua.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   My pleasure.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   The other drawbacks that I didn't mention there or the things that I think about is,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   number one, I worry about conscription a lot.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   That's a frustration, but that probably is not a concern for you at this point in time.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I worry about conscription for my children, things like that.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   That was a big motivator for me of going abroad.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Legal, there are some other things that are important.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Your business opportunities can be constrained in certain markets based upon being an American citizen.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   International banking becomes very complicated if you are an American citizen.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   If you are one who wants to have access to the world's best banking system outside of the United States,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   it's really nice not to be a U.S. person.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   However, you already are a U.S. person as a permanent resident.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And so for you, I'm not mentioning that a lot.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And if somebody doesn't like the United States, so they don't want to see themselves living there,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   then I think that those are good reasons not to set up a permanent relationship.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   In your situation, after listening to you and the factors that you said,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   to me it seems like being a U.S. citizen is probably a good idea.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   But there have been several other times when in almost an exact conversation like this,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I've given the opposite advice.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   But for you, it does seem like a good thing.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   So good luck to you.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I hope it works out.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And then back it up with the Greek one as soon as you're able to get that done as well.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   All for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Offer in soon. See dealer for details.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Nick in New York. Nick, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Hi, Joshua. I have a question regarding stocks versus bonds.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   In the past, in past episodes, you've said how owners make more money than lenders.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And there is a fraction of Twitter of the bowtie variety that I believe you're familiar with
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   that seems to be advocating now 20 to 30 year bonds at 4 or 5% as the ideal, let's say, at the moment vehicle.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And while I do understand if someone is already, let's say, at the fire setting where they have 25 times their yearly needs,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   you can lock that in 20 years and then benefit from the current interest rates.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I don't really know how this applies to someone in the building wealth phase.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   So what I'm essentially asking is for someone still building, is the traditional DCA advice into stock market,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   is it applicable today or have these very large interest rates changed the calculus that we're supposed to be following?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I wish I was smart enough to answer that. Honestly, I wish I were.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I never feel dumber than when I listen to smart, persuasive people talk about investing and investing advice
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   because it always just makes me feel like everyone else knows more than I do.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Everyone else has more insight, better history, experience, etc.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And I just, it often makes me feel dumb.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And so the best I can do for you is do what I do for myself, which is try to say,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   number one, I should do what I understand and I should try to create an argument for myself
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and try to create a fairly simple and focused approach to answer, so to know why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   So let me lay out how I think about it because I'm not a good prognosticator.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I don't have any experience on Wall Street. I don't have any particularly unique investment insight.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And so I'm not that smart, but I think this approach makes sense.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Number one, the most important thing is to have an investment strategy that you yourself understand
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and that you yourself are committed to.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And so if you have that, then you can gain fully and reap the rewards of your investment strategy.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   When I was a young green financial advisor, I was very enthusiastic about stocks and mutual funds
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   and I'd read all my favorite books and I couldn't understand why anybody wouldn't want to invest in the stock market.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And as I have grown older, I have interacted with many people who didn't want to invest in the stock market
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   because they said, "I don't trust the stock market," things like that.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And I no longer make fun of those people. I don't criticize them. I don't say that they're wrong.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I encourage them to invest into something that they know and feel confident in.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Because stocks are not the only investment. T-bonds are not, treasuries are not the only investment.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And the most important thing is that you invest into something that you know and are confident in.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Many people have gotten rich investing in the weirdest things that you and I would never be involved in,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   but they knew it and they were interested in it and it worked for them.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   So if there is a strategy that you know well and are confident in and believe in, that's the strategy for you.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   In the same way that I think just about any diet plan can help somebody to lose weight,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I think just about any investment plan can help somebody to invest effectively and successfully.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   It is a worthy argument to say, "Is one diet better than another?"
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   But in order to qualify a diet as better than another, you have to do some intense qualification.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   You have to say the factors upon which you're going to rank a diet
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and how you're going to compare one to another, etc.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And so it becomes very complex.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   At the end of the day, simplicity works.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And some of the most effective dieters are those who have a very simple diet.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   It may not be the ultimate perfect one, but it's simple.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And it's because they apply it consistently, it works for them.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And investment strategies are the same way.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   The guy who comes home from work every day and takes his pocket change out of his pocket,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   or probably better is I knew a guy one time who anytime he had a $5 bill, he always saved it.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   That was it.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So somebody gave him $5 change, at the end of the day it went aside.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   He always saved his $5 bills.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And every year he took a great vacation on his $5 bills.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And that was his little trick that worked for him.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So the advice of dollar cost average into a high-quality mutual fund, of course it works.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Buying an index fund, of course it works.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Buying a great actively managed fund, of course it works,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   because you're engaging in behaviors that work over time.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Is it going to work better than buying a portfolio of treasuries because interest rates are high?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Well, how would you define better?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And I'm not ignorant of Bowtied Bull as the primary leader of the Bowtied community
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   and the conversation happening right now.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I'm coming to that.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But I'm trying to lay some ground rules that I can understand that I think most people can understand.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Do what you know, and almost any plan will work fine.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Because the nuts and bolts of building wealth are really simple.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It's earn as much money as you can, spend less than you earn so you create investment capital,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   invest that capital as wisely as you can at the highest possible rate of return that you can
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   in a way that's in accordance with your goals.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   That's it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   It's not any more complicated than that.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And if you're a believer in your current strategy,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   then you should be very skeptical of changing for any reason.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   So understand what you do and a plan that you know and understand,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   even though that plan is suboptimal, is that to someone else's plan,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   it's better for you because you know it and you believe it and it's a behavioral thing.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And money is primarily a behavioral thing, not a knowledge thing.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Next, a lot of investment advice or investment strategies are very cyclical.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So the focus right now on high interest rates is important,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   but it's a cyclical thing.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And so if you're the kind of person who is so involved in your investments
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   that on a monthly, quarterly, several-year basis,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   you're making changes to your portfolio, then you should follow those changes.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   But if you're not that involved and you don't want to learn enough to be involved
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and to be that engaged with what you're doing, then you shouldn't do that.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   And it's a matter of perspective on yourself.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   So a guy like Bull, who comes from Wall Street and who's highly involved in stuff
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   and who's built an enormous business and platform doing this stuff,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   he cares deeply about investing.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And of course, he's changing all the time.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And so that kind of response and adapting to the markets
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   is a natural part of his mentality, and I think it's the right thing for him.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   But that doesn't invalidate somebody who's not so interested
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   just simply buying shares of companies and holding them for the long term.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Make fun of that guy all you want.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Some years, one guy will look like a genius.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Some years, the other guy looks like a genius.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   But at its core, accumulating shares of high-quality companies at low prices,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   getting them at a low average share price because your dollar cost averaging,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I can't find any flaws in that logic.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's interesting to talk about whether and what may or may not happen because of this,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   but I can't find any flaws in that fundamental logic.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And if you buy into that thesis that the greatest companies in the United States
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and the world are going to continue to work hard to make money,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   there's going to be setbacks and trouble, etc.,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   but at its core, professional businessmen are going to find ways to make money
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   and expand their markets, etc.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   The world's not going to disappear in a giant mushroom cloud.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Everywhere, all at once, then I think it works.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Now, the third level that I go to is level of goals.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   What are your goals?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   So if today you took all of your money and you could start making 5% interest income on it this year,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   what would that do for you in terms of your personal scenario?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Well, if you got $10 million in the bank, which is bull's point,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   if you got $10 million in the bank and you can just sit back
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   and take $500,000 of straight zero-risk income from treasuries,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   then obviously that's a great move.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   And it's probably a much smarter move than sitting back and trying to sell shares
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and trade and do dividends, etc.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I mean, 5% risk-free from treasuries?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   That's incredible.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   You take zero risk with your money and you continue to have an enormous cash flow.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   But if you've got $25,000 in the bank, as you described,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   you didn't say you had that, but I'm saying if you're still in the accumulation phase
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   and you have a modest amount, then 5%?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Who cares? It doesn't do anything for you.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   You need the long-term growth.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   And so accumulating money in treasuries might be okay if you're averse to stock market investing,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   but to me, I would see that as a much more appropriate for you to be in an accumulation phase,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   hoping for excess market returns.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   But then I would steer you in the direction I always do of saying,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   "Are you investing in your income? Are you growing a business?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Is there a better investment?" etc., rather than just doing it in an entirely abstract perspective.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   So in summary, I don't see anything fundamentally wrong with the standard advice of
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   save money, buy good quality investments in companies,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   and dollar-cost averaging over time.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   I do believe that owners are always going to get richer than lenders in the fullness of time.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   But I do also note that it's times like this that make the appeal of broader strategies,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   such as the permanent portfolio, a little bit more appealing.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Whereas if not all of your money were invested in stocks,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   then you wouldn't feel like you were missing out.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   If you had 25% of your money in long-term treasuries,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   like something like the permanent portfolio would encourage you to do,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   then you gain through the various cycles.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   So if you don't like this current structure,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   instead don't necessarily think about going all your money into treasuries.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Look around and see if there's some other alternative strategy
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   that might give you more of the exposure that you're looking for,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and be something that you can understand and commit to that makes sense.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Having the perfect strategy is not necessary.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   I couldn't tell you what the perfect strategy is.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Maybe someone else can.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   But having a strategy that you understand and believe in is fine.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And whatever that happens to be for you, that's what you should do.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Right. Yeah. So, I mean, this is...
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   It's not my area of expertise, right?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I'm probably following what 99 out of the 100 personal finance books say
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   regarding the DCA in the stock market with appropriate level of risks.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   So, yeah, I was wondering, again, if a new book would be written today,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   if that book would say something different because of the current situation,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I guess, that we live in.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   But your point is understood, that many strategies will work,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   and you don't have a crystal ball to necessarily encourage someone
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   to go more of the bond route than the stock market route today.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Yeah. So, this is where you get into the area of personal financial advice,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   meaning that here is where you have to look at the level of your goals.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Why are you investing in the first place?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   What is a successful investment?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And then bring that back and say, "What should I do?"
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And so, I think if you were asking this question directly to Bull,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I think what he would say is probably something like, "What are your goals?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   What are you trying to do?"
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And if you are in the accumulation phase,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   I don't think he would tell you to put your money into treasuries.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   I think he would tell you to start a business and have your own thing
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   and start making Wi-Fi money.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   That would be his advice because that's going to be a much better approach for you
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   over the long term.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   It's only when you have made it, meaning you have a huge amount of money
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   in your investments and you're thinking about then,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   "How do I create income from this?"
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   that I think you would then seriously consider that question.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And so, for somebody who's sitting with a portfolio of millions of dollars
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and who's sitting down and looking at a risk-free rate of return--
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   risk-free rate of income, more than 5%,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and then looking at all the uncertainty of the stock market,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   now I would give a different set of advice
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and I would seriously consider pursuing something like that.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   But you have to match that to a set of goals.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   And so, someone in that situation has to say, "How much money do I need?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Do I need to grow my portfolio? Do I not?"
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And what you discover is that while your risk tolerance
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   might increase as your wealth grows,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   your need to take risk decreases.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And so, it's just not necessary anymore.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   You don't need to take risk.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   And so, why take unnecessary market risk if there is an alternative?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   - Right. Okay, I understand.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   - This is the problem with basically all advice
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   and with all people who speak generally,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   is you have to filter the advice through where you are at the time
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and what your overall goals are.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And I do my best to make that clear every time I answer one of these questions.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   You have to say where you are.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   But let me give a non-financial example to drive this point home.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I have young children.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   I do not allow my children to--
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Generally speaking, I don't allow my children to use computers
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   or digital devices with a few limited exceptions.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   We use digital devices for a lot of audio books.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   I use several apps specifically for a few components of their education.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   But it's very, very limited.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   I don't do that because I'm opposed to the use of devices.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I make a living from a computer screen.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And my computer is on all the time.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   My phone is very rarely out of reach.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I do that because from a developmental perspective,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   I want them to first have the gift of a quiet mind,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   an active imagination, and an undistractable character.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And I don't believe that inserting those devices at an early age
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   is an appropriate way of helping them to develop those character qualities.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   So if somebody just heard me say,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   "I don't allow my children to use computers
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   or to spend a lot of time on screens,"
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   they might draw a very erroneous conclusion
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   that I don't think that your children should use those devices.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It has to do with age, development, and purpose.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   So the same thing--
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   When my children are 15,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   I want them to be spending quite a lot of time on computer screens.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   I'm hoping that they're not spending all their time gaming.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   I'm hoping that they're programming.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I'm hoping that they're editing videos and making money
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   and learning how to set up funnels
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   or whatever the running accounting software, etc.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   That's going to be very different at 15 versus at 7.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   So the same thing with investment advice.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   In order to understand what advice is correct,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   that's where you have to say,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   "Where is somebody in the stages of wealth building?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Where is somebody in terms of the goals, etc.?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   Then apply the investment strategy that fits the goals.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   A content creator like me or like Bull,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   we can't do that in public
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   without a whole lot of contextualization.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   That contextualization can be done in a podcast, maybe,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   where I may take 30 minutes to talk about something.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   In 280 characters, Bull's not doing it.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   You have to do that and you have to say,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   "Does this advice make sense for me right now?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   If I did this, would this get me closer towards my long-term goal
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   or farther away?"
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   That's for you to decide.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   - Right. Got it. - Make sense?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   - Okay.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   I have a quick comment, if I may.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   I only caught this part of the previous caller
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   talking about Greece and Canada.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I spent a good chunk of my life in Greece.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I think there is a certain romanticizing
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   that can happen from the outside.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   I think it's a beautiful country.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Probably, today, it's more socially conservative
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   than the US, perhaps.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   But I think that the freedom that you have within the United States
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   where you don't like something that your state does
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   and you go to another state,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   that doesn't exist anywhere else as far as I know.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   If you're in Europe,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   changing really means changing country.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And then you don't achieve all that much
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   because there is a top-down push from the EU
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   for anything really important.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So I would consider long and hard
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   for someone who's in the US
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and has so many degrees of freedom,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   giving that up, not just adding an option,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   but giving that up to go in a setting that's more constrained.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   - Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Your advice and your comments are exactly correct.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   That caller, I don't think, was interested in moving to Greece.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Her husband was pursuing claiming Greek citizenship by ancestry.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   So having Greek citizenship would give them another passport,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   would give them the ability to live anywhere in the EU
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   that they wanted to live,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   but it wouldn't involve them specifically moving to Greece.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   And I think your point is well taken, though,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   which is why I try not to be a US hater.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   And I think that many people become very...
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   just out of whack when they leave the United States
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   and they build their entire brand on hating on the United States.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   The United States has much higher levels of freedom
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   for the average resident or citizen
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   because you can find your people much more broadly.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   And in a nation of 330 million people
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   who are all united by a common language
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and a broadly common culture,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   the subcultures in the United States are so enormous
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   that you can be surrounded,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   even if you're a part of a very small subculture,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   you can be surrounded by many, many, many of your community members
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   and live various lifestyles with those community members.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And that's not the same with Europe.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The European Union may represent something like 450 million people across Europe,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   but those cultures from the 26, 27, I don't remember,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   from the member nations are much, much smaller.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   And then because they're broadly divided by intense linguistic variation,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   intense cultural differentiation, etc.,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   when you go into a place...
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   If I went into Greece and I wanted to live there,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   I could certainly live there and I could be part of the expat community,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   but to acculturate and to learn the language and to be accepted,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   it's going to be several generations before I'm accepted.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And then even then, my own subgroup,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   my peer group or whatever,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   the small community that I'm a part of,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   it's just tiny compared to a place like the United States.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   So your point, I think, is absolutely correct.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Yeah, and I think you experienced this yourself with COVID,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   but the restrictions in Greece during COVID were much, much stricter
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   than even a state like New York, where I live.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And things that Americans take for granted,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   like homeschooling your kids, that's unheard of in Greece and in most of the EU.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   So I think there is a certain, you know,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   the grass is greener on the other side that's going on.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And so I just, you know, because I heard that last part of your,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   the previous caller, I thought that I would just,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   I would just mention this in case, you know,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   she hasn't heard this already from someone else.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Absolutely. There's a long list.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   COVID definitely increased my appreciation of the United States,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   as I have stated publicly otherwise.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Because for all of the issues in the United States,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   there were tens of millions and more than that,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   of people who pretty much think kind of what I think and agreed with me.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   And so they weren't a minor group in any way.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   And other things, First Amendment issues, freedom of speech,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   the United States is one of the most robust places.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   And you watch right now where many nations, England,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   other places that are prosecuting people for saying things that they disagree with.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   There's no legalized freedom of speech.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   The United States is important.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   I have beef with two people, two groups of people.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   I have beef with Americans who have a blind adherence
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   or a blind commitment to the idea that the United States is superior in every way,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   on every issue.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   That seems crazy to me, because we can make a long list where it's not.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   On the other hand, then there's the opposite,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   where people try to paint the United States as behind or inferior on every issue.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   And that's also wrong.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And so I see that the best way to approach it is to say,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   there is a buffet of options across 50 United States,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   across the territories and possessions of the United States where I could live.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   People don't talk a lot about moving to Saipan or to Puerto Rico or to Guam, etc.,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   even though there's some interesting reasons to consider those options.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And then the world is a buffet.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   And for each person, there may be options that are uniquely best for that person.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And you don't have to have a commitment to one nation.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   And I see this as kind of a broad application of the principle of federalism
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   that works so well in the United States, the competition among the states.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   My hope is that over the coming years,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   there'll be more competition among the states and also among the countries of the world,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   and more and more countries will prosper because of that.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   So, great question, Nick. Thank you so much for calling in.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Now for a limited time until Alamo Motorsports.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Offer in soon. See dealer for details.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   I had a couple of other callers that were on the line, but they have jumped off,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   so let me deal with a couple of written questions that I have not gotten to yet.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I have a long list here that has not been done.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Kevin says, "Joshua, what books are you currently reading?"
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   I am currently reading that new book I mentioned on the show.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   What's the title? The Two-Parent Privilege.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   That's kind of the most interesting book.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   As it's probably clearly become obvious by Melissa Kearney, who is the author,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   as it's probably become obvious in some of my content,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   I've become much more interested in some of the societal things that affect people
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   and some of the research and whatnot than money at the current scenario.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   So I'm reading The Two-Parent Privilege.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   I'm reading a book called Boys Adrift by Leonard Sachs
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   that a listener begged me to read and I hadn't gotten around to it.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   I've been aware of it for a while, but I'm reading that.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   So those are my personal reading right now.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   I have some novels that I'm reading and then a lot of stuff with my children
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   I have been really enjoying going through
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   and kind of trying to shore up the errors in my own reading, things I've never read.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   For example, this coming month I'm going to be reading through The Iliad with my eldest child.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   I'm excited because I've never read The Iliad or The Odyssey.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   So those are my next projects, to read some of the classics.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   I'm kind of trying to fix some of my education.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   That has been a big focus for me at the moment.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Next question. Some of these questions I'm going to take and expand them.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Jordan writes in and says, "Hi Joshua.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   My wife and I are expecting a baby and the pregnancy is high risk with a necessary planned c-section.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   The baby is due in March. We have no other children.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   I also expect to have minor surgery for kidney stones in the next 12 months.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Should I change my health care plan, currently in open enrollment,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   to the highest cost and lowest deductible plan where I would not be eligible for an HSA for the next year?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Currently I'm on a plan where I am eligible for the HSA and I max out that contribution.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   I would plan to max it out again if I stay on this plan.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   If helpful I could send a screenshot."
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   No need for a screenshot, Jordan.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   What you do need to do is create a spreadsheet.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   This is a simple exercise and you can do it.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   It will answer your question directly.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   The answer is probably.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   You probably should make that switch.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   If you know that you are going to go through your entire deductible,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   you know that you are going to have a $30,000 c-section,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   you know that you are going to have your own surgery that is going to go through as well,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   then that is the great thing about pregnancy.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   It is planned. You know you are pregnant.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   You know the delivery is coming one way or the other.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   The baby is not going to be in there 11 months from now no matter what.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Probably yes, but just set it up with a spreadsheet.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Put in there the cost of the premium for the different options.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Put in there the cost of the deductible for the different options.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Then put in there any potential tax savings for making your contributions to the HSA
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   and see what the numbers are.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   In most cases I think it will be--
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   It is not always a huge savings.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   When I have done these spreadsheets in the past,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   they often--it is like, okay, well, it is either I pay more in premiums
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   and less in deductible or less in premiums and more in deductible.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Okay, if it is close, I do not know what to tell you.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   I would say probably option one would be that it may be easier to plan
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   for higher premiums with a lower deductible thing, so that works out.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   On the other hand, the baby may miscarry and you may not have the C-section,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   so maybe you should go with the other option.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   But you are going to have to create your own spreadsheet for that,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   and that will answer it for you.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Next, Jared writes, "We have about 12 months until my wife's parents move in with us.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   We are likely to add on a space for them to include their own living area.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   What actions should we and my in-laws be taking to prepare?"
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   Good question.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Hopefully this is a planned event, obviously, about 12 months.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   This does not sound like anything acute where their home got blown away
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   in a hurricane or something.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Excellent.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   This is a planned event.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   It sounds also like this is going to be a long-term event.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   What actions should we and my in-laws be taking to prepare?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   The most recent episode I released was talking about this specifically,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   but in the context of a different question.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   I would say you just want to focus on your relationship,
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   and you want to focus on how to have healthy, good communication among you
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   or between you.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Then, obviously, you want to put in place appropriate boundaries for good living.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   If this is a planned event, they're moving in,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   and undoubtedly you have a good relationship with them.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   It's wonderful, then, that you can be closer
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   and get the good things out of that relationship.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   Every good relationship revolves around good communication.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Good communication doesn't just mean smiling at each other
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   and waving as we go by.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Good communication means developing healthy communication styles,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   especially the ability to handle conflict.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Hopefully there's no basic fundamental expectation of conflict,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   but in human relationships we always have conflict.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   We want to have the ability to communicate about conflict.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   How do you do that?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   It depends on the relationship.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   I think it's wonderful if you actually talk about communication
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   and you actually put in place--
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   if you don't naturally have good communication skills,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   then I think it's useful in many cases to talk about good communication skills.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   There are certain things that you can do that can create that ability.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   One thing you might do would just be to have a conversation
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   and say, "What are the kinds of conflicts that we're likely to have
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   in being in close quarters, living together?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   What are some of the issues that we're likely to face?"
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Let's talk about those before we are emotionally involved in them.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   I think this is one thing that often works out well in business advice
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   for people who are starting companies together.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Let's say there's two business partners who are planning to work together
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   and they're in the early stages of their enterprise
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and they're basically trying to figure out what to do.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   If they can come together with an experienced consultant
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   who will ask them a list of hard questions,
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   then in talking about them it'll open up to them the world.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   "What are you guys going to do if you disagree on a marketing strategy?"
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   "What are you guys going to do if partner A gets divorced
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   and now you've got a three-way partnership with partner A's ex-spouse?"
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   "What are you guys going to do if partner B wants to do X, Y, and Z?"
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Talking about the problems that could come
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   and then seeing how those conversations come is a really helpful thing.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   I think this is, when it's done well,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   this is probably one of the big benefits of marriage counseling.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   You have a couple that comes together and they start talking about issues.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I don't think that marriage counseling is particularly relevant
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   for helping people make decisions about what they would or wouldn't do
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   in any particular situation.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   To me, after 12 years of being married,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   the idea that my wife and I, prior to marriage,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   could have sat down and said, "Who's going to vacuum the floor
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   and create a contract between us about who does the vacuuming
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   and who does the dishes and who mows the lawn?"
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   To me, that's asinine.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Marriage is a relationship and it changes all the time
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   based upon who can and should do different things.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Yet, talking about those things is probably really healthy
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   because it exposes our communication style
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   and our ability to communicate and accept one another.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   If I find out that my wife has this idea about what marriage is going to be like
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   and I have the other idea about what marriage is going to be like,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   then the way that we talk about our disagreements is pretty useful
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   to see do we have the ability to resolve these disagreements.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   I think one thing that can often be helpful
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   is establishing rules for communication.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   I don't know necessarily how this would work with in-laws,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   but if I imagine being in this situation,
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   I would want to have some kind of structure
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   or some kind of ground rules for communication.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   I don't know the application because I haven't faced this in terms of in-laws,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   but I use the example to inspire your creativity.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   I use the example of something that my wife and I did before
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   we were married or engaged.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   I just simply said to her, "We're never going to play games,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   we're going to play communications games."
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   The rule was around calling and texting.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   I said to her, "If you call me, I will answer the phone if I'm available
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   and I will never play games with you.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   If I don't answer the phone, it's because I'm busy.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   It's not because I'm ignoring you.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   If I'm in a meeting or I'm working or I can't talk on the phone,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   then I'm not going to answer the phone.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   You don't ever have to worry about the fact that you called me
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and I saw your name on the screen and I was mad at you and I didn't pick up."
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   I said the same thing both ways,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   "Don't ever not pick up the phone because there's some kind of game going on."
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   To me, having that established at a very early age,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   excuse me, early point in our relationship was a tremendous blessing
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   because we were young and young people played so many dumb games about,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   "I'm mad at him. I don't want to talk to him right now."
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   "It rang twice and then she hit end. What does that mean? What's going on?"
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   Just have a rock solid knowledge that if you don't pick up the phone,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   it's because you're busy and you can't talk on the phone.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   I don't have to worry about it.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   It's never been any other way and it has eliminated a huge point of stress.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Having regular times to connect and to communicate.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   In the context of a relationship with a husband and a wife,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   having a time where you sit down for tea every night is really important
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   because then you can iron things out on a small basis.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   With in-laws, I think some expectations such as,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   "We're going to have a meal together every week."
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   "We're going to have two meals together every week."
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   We can iron out, we can establish the basis that we're the kind of people
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   who share a couple meals together every week.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   That will allow us to have a natural format for resolving conflict
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   rather than an unnatural format.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   On the other hand, setting some expectations about,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   "We're going to have two meals together a week."
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   "That seems really healthy."
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Or whatever the version is that you're going to do.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   "We're not going to be together all the time."
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   "We're not going to be each other's living space all the time."
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   "There's going to be boundaries and separation."
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Just simply establishing those things.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   The fact that we're not inviting you in at 6 o'clock on Tuesday night
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   to come in and chat doesn't mean we don't love you.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   It's that this is our family time and we need to be for dinner.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Those kinds of ground rules are useful.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   I don't think this would be appropriate with in-laws
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   because it would be a difficult thing to work.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   But I do share as another example of something that I benefited from
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   and my wife benefited from.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Early in our relationship, we mutually read through a book on communication.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   It wasn't a structured thing. Nobody said to do it.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   I had read a book called Crucial Conversations that was recommended to me.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   I liked it. I shared it with her. She read it.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   It became something really useful. I think it's a really good book.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   I still recommend it, although I haven't read it in a decade.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   But basically, it laid out the idea that when you are having conversations with people
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   and there's intensity behind it,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   here is how you use that intensity for a positive end.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   To this day, I think we still use some of the language for that.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   If there's something we disagree about or something like that,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   then it works out well to have some context.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   You can always create safety in the conversation.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   That's all I remember from the book at this point.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Safety not meaning physical safety, but you just want to create an environment
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   where somebody feels safe to share how he or she really feels.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   That takes practice.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   If it comes to that, again, I would have a hard time imagining doing this within laws,
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   but reading through a book on communication or talking about communication itself
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   is probably useful.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Beyond that, I think that you want to think about the space, obviously.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   It's wonderful for somebody to have their own living area and to be close to you.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   It's much more difficult if you're living in the same space.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   I'm not sure two women can share a house with peace for an extended period of time
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   without some kind of really superhuman ability to just resolve things.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   I thought I would be a wonderful husband and hire a housekeeper for my wife.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   So I hired a housekeeper that came in and worked in our house and helped out and whatnot.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Finally, after, I don't know, it was a year, year and a half, my wife put up with it.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   She's like, "I don't want a housekeeper in my house. I don't want her here."
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   So we went with her from five days a week to one day a week.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   It sounds silly, I think, but I'm also not a woman, and my wife is not into that.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   I watched my mom and my sisters over the years.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   In the most positive relationship, it just seems very hard for two women to share a house,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   two women to share a kitchen, two women to share a common living space.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   But each of them, if your wife can have her space and her mother can have her own space,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   that's really ideal.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   That should be, I think, the ideal structure.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   It doesn't need to be a big space, but it needs to be a clearly separate space
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   where each of them are in charge of their own space,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   and there's some expectations set around that.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Beyond that, I think the practicalities can work their way out.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   I'm sure you wouldn't be doing this and inserting potential conflict into your family
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   unless you had a high degree of confidence that this was going to be a win.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   I think in most cases, when you have that degree of confidence, then it can be a win-win.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   It'll be a blessing for you, it'll be a blessing for your wife to have her parents close,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   and it'll be a blessing for them to be with their daughter and, who knows, grandchildren,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   whatever else your family looks like.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   I think that it is wonderful, but you do need to pay careful attention to those specific details.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   That's it for today. I think that's enough.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
