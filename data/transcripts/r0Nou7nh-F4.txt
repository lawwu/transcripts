[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500]   are to be found in the book of the prophet Ezekiel,
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.000]   in the 36th chapter, verse 34 and the first part of verse 35.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Verse 34 and the first part of verse 35,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   in the 36th chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And they shall say, this land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And they shall say, this land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Well, here is still another addition.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Those who attend here regularly Sunday by Sunday will realize,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   to the series of things that we have been told in this section,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   concerning the nature of the benefits and the blessings
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   which come to a people when realizing their sin and repenting and forsaking their sin,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   they turn to God.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   This whole section, beginning from verse 16 and going to the end of the chapter,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   is just a tremendous statement of that.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Now, its first reference, of course, was to the children of Israel in their then situation.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Because of their sin, they had been carried away captives to the land of Babylon.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   They were far away from their own country.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Jerusalem was in a state of ruin, and their country had not been cultivated nor tilled for a number of years.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And God here promises that he is going to bring them back.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It is his action entirely from beginning to end.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And he gives them an account of the wonderful benefits that will accrue to them
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   as the result of this, his action.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Now, that is the primary meaning.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But, as we have been seeing Sunday by Sunday,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   this paragraph, this great statement, is over and above all that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   One of those remarkable and striking Old Testament adumbrations of the Christian gospel.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   There is no more glorious statement of the benefits of salvation
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   which is to be obtained in Jesus Christ our Lord, than that which we have here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It is in a pictorial form.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And that is an advantage, especially in days and times such as these.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Here you have in pictures what you have stated so abundantly and so gloriously, for instance,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   where he tells us something about the riches of God's grace in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And we are just working our way through it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Now, here is yet another blessing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You notice again this "and".
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He has told us a number of things that happen to those who become Christians.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Not only that, he says "and" also.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Here is something further.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   There is, in other words, literally no end to the blessings of salvation.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Paul refers to them as the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You cannot describe them.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   They are so marvelous, they are so endless.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   But it is our business to look at the details that we are given.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Now again, as we come to look at this tonight,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I would remind you of the principle that we have seen in operation from the very beginning.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   The business of the gospel is to undo the effects of sin.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   For this cause the Son of God was manifested, says the Apostle John in his first epistle,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   that he might destroy the works of the devil.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And that is what we see here step by step and stage by stage.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now, last Sunday night, we were looking at what we called the ruinous effects of sin.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   There the picture was that in that day that I shall have cleansed you from your iniquities,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I will cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And our theme was, as I say, that sin is that which ruins life.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It ruins men. It ruins the soul.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It defaces God's image in men. Sin as a ruination.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now, that is not our subject this evening.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We've got something further.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Sin not only does that.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Sin is also something which wastes life.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Sin is something which is entirely unproductive.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It isn't so much that it brings down and ruins,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   as that it leaves something which ought to be productive in a non- or unproductive condition.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And that, in other words, is, as I say, nothing but sheer waste.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   The wastefulness of the sinful life.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Unproductive character.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, the apostle, of course, was speaking literally, as I say,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   about the condition of the children of Israel.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Because they'd been carried away captive from their own land to Babylon,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   their land was not being cultivated.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It was untilled. It was lying fallow, unused.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   No crops were coming out of it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   There it was derelict and desolate.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Now, that is what sin always leads to.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   That's our theme this evening.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But before I come to deal with it in detail, let me indicate this once more.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Are we not reminded once again
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   of what is the very essence of the biblical message from beginning to end?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   That sin is a most terrible and devastating thing.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   That's the teaching, I say, of the Bible everywhere.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   The fall was the greatest calamity that could possibly have happened to man and to this world.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Now, you see, if we don't agree with that, we'll never understand the biblical message.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   We can never understand the Christian message of salvation
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   until we do understand this doctrine of sin and of the fall.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I say it was the most devastating thing that could possibly have happened to man and to his world.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   In other words, there is nothing which is quite so fatal as to think of sin as something slight
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   or to think of sin, as so many do today, as something negative.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   That is how they think of it.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Most people hate Christianity because of its doctrine of sin.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   "Ah," they say, "this idea of the miserable sinner and condemnation and repentance."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   They don't like it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They want to be cheerful and happy, they say, and they say it's a false psychology.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   It's held people down.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They say mankind isn't like that after all.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   They hate the doctrine of sin today, and that is why they're not Christian.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   But the biblical doctrine of sin is here from beginning to end.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And I say it is a sheer impossibility to understand the Christian message of redemption
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   except in the light of the biblical doctrine of sin and of the fall.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Sin is not something light, something merely negative.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It is as devastating as this, that nothing in man has been left unaffected by it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Now I wonder whether we realize that.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   There is nothing in us, there is no part of man, but that it was affected by the fall.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The fall of man into sin affected his mind, it affected his emotions, it affected his will.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It affected every part of man, the intellectual part, the moral part, the volitional part.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Divide man up as you like.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   There is not a part or portion of man but that it has been totally affected.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   When man fell, he fell completely.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And it is a most horrible ruin.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   It is an utter desolation.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Now these steps that we go through one by one in this section remind us all of that.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And they bring out this point, I say, that sin was a terrible and a fearful calamity.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And that is the whole explanation of the state of the world this evening.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We are just seeing before our eyes and in the newspapers and in listening to the news on the wireless,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   we are just looking at some of the effects and the results of the fall of men and of sin.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It is a calamity of the deepest type.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   But, and this is the thing that brings us together,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   this is the message of the gospel.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   However profound the effect of sin and the fall may be,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   the effects of the gospel are equally profound.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   So that as I bring out step by step and stage by stage from Sunday to Sunday
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   the effects of the fall and of sin, I show you at the same time the effects of the gospel of redemption.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And it cancels and more than cancels everything that the fall and sin have done.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Now that is just my inadequate way of saying which the apostle Paul put in a phrase when he said this,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And that's what I keep on seeing in this paragraph.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I see sin abounding.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I see what it's done to men.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I see the ruin and the havoc and the desolation.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Ah, but I listen to the word of God that came to the prophet Ezekiel,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   telling him what he was going to do.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And as I listen to it, I say, "Yes, it's all right.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Sin has abounded, but grace has much more abounded."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   The glories of the gospel.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But my dear friends, you'll never see them unless you see first of all the devastating effects of sin.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Very well, then, here it is put in this form this evening.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Sin, I say, is that which is utterly unproductive.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It is barren.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It is sterile.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I want to show you that in general and in particular.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   What I mean by that is this, that sin has this effect, first of all, in the world at large.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It has this effect upon the individual.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It has this effect upon us personally.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Now, I want to concentrate, of course, upon the personal in particular.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But I must point out the general because it's such a confirmation of this biblical message.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   You see this message in the world as it is today.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It's a barren age in which we are living.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It's an unproductive age.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I don't care which department of life you look at.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   That is the truth about it.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Isn't it true in the realm of music?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Isn't it true in the realm of art?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Do you think much modern music is going to endure?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Do you think people will still be trying to sing it or to listen to its being played in a hundred years' time?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If there is still a world in a hundred years' time, I doubt it very seriously.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   How much modern poetry is going to live?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's a barren age.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Oh, it's a clever age.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And what you see in the music and the poetry and in the art is cleverness rather than true art.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You see the artifice rather than the art.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   You see the artifact rather than true artistry.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   But this is something I say which you can see very clearly if you take a broad view of history.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And what you see is this, that the ages of faith have always been most productive in every respect all along the line.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You know you can look at history like that.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   You take a broad view of history and you see that there have been certain eras and epochs in the history of the world
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   when men's relationship to God has been the chiefest thing.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   There have been so-called ages of faith.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   When the Christian faith and the Christian message has counted and it's been supreme
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and it has been the controlling factor in the life of men.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Now you will find invariably that in all such ages of faith
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   there has been an amazing stimulus all along the line almost in every respect.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   You've got great buildings, great architecture, great sculpture, great music, great poetry, great drama, great everything.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Work it out in history.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And this is something which is actually acknowledged by many secular historians
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   who are not actually Christians themselves.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   They have to admit the fact.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The ages of faith have been productive.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   There is something about this Christian message when it influences men
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   which even influences those who are not actually Christians themselves.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   The whole community derives a benefit.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Now that's a great theme, isn't it?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And it might very well have detained us for the whole evening
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   but I'm anxious to bring this consideration of this paragraph to a close next Sunday night.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So I can't stay with it as I'd like to.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   But it is, I say, a fact.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   The whole country derives a benefit when there's been a religious awakening.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   That is why you see the Elizabethan period, that is why the Puritan era,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   that is why the period following the great evangelical awakening of 200 years ago
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   have seen some of the greatest cultural advances that this country has ever known.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   But on the other hand, the ages of unbelief have always been barren and sterile.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   This is a wonderful proof of the fact that man was made for God.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And when he is not functioning in relationship to God and as God meant him,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   he fails all along the line.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   You see, let me give you one hurried example.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Take the period following the Puritan era, the restoration of Charles II,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and all the licentiousness of his court.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   When men turned their backs upon the faith and lived according to their own ideas,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   you know it was a terribly barren period, even in a secular sense, from 1660 to about 1740.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   In every respect it was barren and sterile.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Men, culturally even, seemed to be entirely uncultivated.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And as I said just now, alas, you and I seem to be living in a similar age.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   When you contrast the productivity of this age, this century, with last century,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I think every thinking man, every man who is not hopelessly prejudiced and blinded,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   has got to admit that we are utterly unproductive,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   especially as we contrast ourselves with some of those great epochs and eras.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Sin is unproductive.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   The whole of life seems to come to a standstill.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Look at the most backward countries in the world today,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and you'll find that they're countries where the Christian faith in its purity has been least preached.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   On the contrary, wherever the Christian message goes, it always provides a kind of civilization.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It gives an impetus to everything that is uplifting and ennobling in the life of men.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   In its wake come education and hospitals and all these things.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   The most backward peoples and races are those who have not received the powerful direct message of the Christian faith.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   They're backwards in every respect.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Now here, you see, is a great confirmation of what we are told in our text this evening.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Well, let us leave it in general and let's begin to look at it in particular.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Because, after all, this applies to us individually.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   We will not be examined at the final bar of judgment upon the state of civilization,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   but upon our own condition.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It is important, we should realize, that it works all along the line,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   but it's much more vitally urgent that we should realize it about ourselves.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And therefore the question we ask ourselves is, what is our condition this evening?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   What's the state of our souls?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   God made men and he breathed into him the breath of life and men became a living soul.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   There's the soil. There's the possibility.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   What's happened to it?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   What's become of it?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   If we are inspected this evening as a man might inspect a farm or an estate, what does he find?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   What are the productivity? That's the question. Productivity.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   What is it looking like this evening?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Well, now then, let's examine ourselves. Let me hold the picture before you.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The biblical message is that sin, I say, is always unproductive and always leads to barrenness
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and to a sterile condition.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   The life of every individual man in sin is like that land of Israel
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   when the children of Israel were in Babylon and were unable to cultivate it.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Now let me prove my point.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Let me prove to you that sin of necessity and always is unproductive.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I do so, first of all, in general by putting it in the form of a principle.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Sin is obviously and must be unproductive
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   because it never makes the right use of our faculties
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   and therefore never draws out the possibilities that are innate and inherent within us.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Sin is that which neglects the soil of the soul.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   There was nobody to till the land, therefore it was nonproductive.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Now, in a state of sin, man is exactly like that.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   For all that sin does to us doesn't use our faculties as they should be used
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and therefore it doesn't draw out the power that is in them.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Let me give you some illustrations to show what I mean.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I make no apology for being very blunt, very direct and very practical tonight.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   The newspapers are full of this sort of thing, the films are full of it,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   so let me show you the relevance and the practical character of the preaching of the gospel.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So I start with sex.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   The world is mad on sex.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   There's no question about that.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   This is a sex-ridden generation.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   This is a sex-mad generation.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Very well, sex is an instinct in men placed there by God.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It's one of the faculties that God has put into man.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Yes, but you see, this is what sin does.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Sin, instead of using sex as it was meant to be used, as a means to an end, isolates it.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It makes it an end in itself.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   That's lust.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   You see, the whole tragedy of men at the present time is just this,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   that instead of allowing this instinct of sex, which is a part of men and his makeup as God made him,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   to play its rightful part and to be in its right position, it's taken out of that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's put up, it's made headlines, it's underlined, it's splashed in front of us.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Sex is the big thing.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Taken right out of its context and stimulated artificially,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   regarded as an end and object in itself, and men live for sex.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   That's why, you see, it's unproductive.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Sex was put into men in order, as we are told in the book of Genesis,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and it's repeated in many places, that men might replenish the earth.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   People are not interested in that today.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   They are not interested in replenishing the earth.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   That's not their interest in sex.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Their interest in sex is in sex.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Sex is an experience.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Sex is a form of enjoyment.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   It's isolated.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's an end in itself, and it's exaggerated hopelessly.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And the result is barrenness and sterility, physically, literally, as well as spiritually.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I needn't take your time in stressing the importance of all this.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   This particular aspect of sex and of sin may very well affect profoundly
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   the whole future of this country and of the whole world.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   The whole balance of population may become such
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   that what we've boasted of as our Western civilization may be entirely overcome,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   merely because of lack of numbers.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I leave you to think of it all for yourself.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I'm taking it as an illustration.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Let me take another.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Man in sin, of course, does exactly the same thing with happiness and with joy.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   He makes happiness an end in itself, and joy and pleasure ends in themselves.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   They were never meant to be that.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Happiness is not an end.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Happiness is a byproduct.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Happiness is something that is to happen more or less unconsciously
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   because we are obeying certain laws.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It was never meant to be a direct objective,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   but I don't think nobody can dispute this,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   that happiness and joy and pleasure have become an end in and of themselves.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   We've isolated this again, and we've exaggerated it.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Work is a nuisance.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   What is work, according to the modern men in sin?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Well, work is just something that you've got to do
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   if you want to have money to have your pleasure and your happiness.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's something hateful.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It's something quite abominable.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It shouldn't be, and many would be delighted
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   if something could be invented to put an end to it all.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's something that is disgraceful,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   something one has to go through in order to something else.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Our eye is on the pleasure, not on the dignity and the greatness
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   and the nobility and the value of work.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   In other words, our whole idea is unproductive,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   and the end is lack of production.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   But that is how sin works, you see.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It takes things which are given by God and which are very right and very normal.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   It takes them out of their context.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   It exaggerates them.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   It isolates them.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   It puts them up as the ultimate target, which they are never meant to be,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   and then it whips us and presses them after them,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   and thus we find ourselves exhausted and utterly unproductive.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Or let me put it to you in this form.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Now there I've been looking at it, if you like,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   philosophically or psychologically, if you prefer it.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Now let me take it in the form of particular illustrations.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I'm obviously simply picking out the things that are most prominent in the life of modern men.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I could take it all along the line.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I'm taking the things that the average individual is living for today
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and the things that are acclaimed and praised in the newspapers,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   the things that strike the headlines as the phrase goes.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Now then, look at the question of drink for a moment.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I'll take all this talk about drink.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   The camaraderie of the local.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Have you noticed it on the wireless?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   As if there was nothing more marvelous in the world
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   than the wonderful life of the local public house.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   How it's praised and lauded.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Marvelous. This is life.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Gosh, what a contrast it presents to a miserable chapel
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   or a prayer meeting or something like--
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Ah, this is life and happiness and joviality.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Now, look at drink for a moment. What does it do?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Well, the final thing to say about drink, and I'm speaking now pharmacologically,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   strictly scientifically, from the pharmacological standpoint,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   drink is entirely and totally unproductive.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   For, you see, what it really does is to paralyze the faculties, not to stimulate them.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Now, you thought drink was a stimulus, didn't you? It isn't.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Alcohol is not a stimulant.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   You can challenge me if you like. Look up your books on pharmacology,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and you will find that I'm right when I say that alcohol is not a stimulant but a depressant.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   It works like this. I think I've told some of you this before.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   The effect of drink is that it paralyzes the higher centers, the control, the balance,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and the result of the paralysis of those is that the more primitive things come to the surface
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and a man appears to be brilliant, what is really happening is that he's beginning to be reckless.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   He's losing his judgment and his balance.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Drink is entirely paralyzing. It attacks the faculties.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It doesn't draw them out. It doesn't stimulate them.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   It knocks out the highest and the best.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I needn't waste your time in pointing out that something very similar is true of drugs.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   All drugs either overstimulate or else paralyze and depress.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And the result of all this is, you see, that none of our faculties are really being used.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   They are lying waste. They are unproductive.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Or take perhaps the most obvious illustration of all,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   because it's one of the most popular things today, take gambling.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Now you notice that I'm not just preaching against these things.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I'm just showing you their real nature.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   That's why I never preach against particular sins.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It isn't the function of preaching.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   The function of preaching is to open men's eyes to the facts about what they're doing
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and then, having seen it by the spirit, they will stop doing it.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The preacher is not meant to be a schoolmaster.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   He's meant to be a man who's to hold the truth before people.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And once a man sees it, he forsakes it.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Now take gambling. Well, the whole point about gambling again is, of course, that it's entirely non-productive.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   It's the desire to have wealth without doing anything for it.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   It's all this pleasure, menia, once more, a man wants wealth,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   not because he's worked and has achieved it and a right to have it,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   but simply wealth in and of itself, direct measure, no production,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   nothing to show for it, of no value to the community at large.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I think most people, most sociologists, agree about that,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   that gambling is entirely un- or non-productive.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Very well, there it is in general.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Well, then, of course, the effects of all this show themselves as they did in the case of the land of Israel.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   The first thing we notice is this.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   The effect of sin always, this lack of cultivation,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   is that the land has an ugly appearance and an untidy appearance.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   You neglect your garden for a few years, it'll soon begin to look untidy, won't it?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Anybody coming in will say, "Oh, well, this has been neglected, ugly, untidy."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I could stay with that, I mustn't, this evening,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   but life has become ugly, life has become untidy.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I mean by that, even such matters as personal appearance.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   We seem to have lost all ideas of real charm and beauty,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   and the whole art of concealment.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Life has become loud and ugly and untidy.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You look at it on the streets, look at it in your newspapers,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   look at it as you know men and women, there it is, I just leave it.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   But come, what is more important is this.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   There is no crop, there's nothing to put in the barns.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   What do I mean by this? Well, I mean this.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   There is nothing in that sinful life that ennobles the soul.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   There is nothing that draws out and develops the faculties and increases them.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   There is nothing to show at the end of a long life.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Oh, the Apostle Paul has put this in what always seems to me
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   the perfect and devastating way in a word in the sixth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   He said, "What profit had he then in those things of which he are now ashamed?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   For the end of those things is death.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Sin is always entirely and utterly unproductive."
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   There is something rather terrible and awful as well as pathetic and tragic
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   in the end of the life of a man who's had no use for God
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   and who doesn't know him and who isn't a Christian.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Ah, some of these brilliant, sophisticated men and women,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   you see them going out of life and what sorry, tragic figures they are.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   You can't help feeling sorry for them.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   They've really got nothing to show, they've got nothing to be proud of,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   they've entertained or amused or tickled the fancy of people.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   But somehow when you look at them in their old age,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   oh, you can't fit it in somehow, it seems almost ridiculous
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and unworthy of a man endowed with faculties such as God has given to men.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   They've nothing to be proud of, nothing to show.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   They've nothing that gives them themselves satisfaction.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   They sit and look back upon the scenes of their former triumphs
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and how wonderful it was while they were yet young.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   They've got nothing now, they've got to skip back across the years
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   to try and find something to give them a sense of satisfaction.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   They've got nothing to fall back upon in the day and in the time of need.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Oh, we've seen this, haven't we?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   We, some of us, may have known it personally.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   You know, that sinful life is all right until something goes wrong.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   As long as you're well and ill and hearty and have got money
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   and can do your work and so on, but suddenly you're taken ill
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and the very bottom drops out of your life, you don't know where you are.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   You've got nothing to fall back upon, no comfort, nothing at all.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   You're simply left to yourself. It's utterly unproductive.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   There's no comfort in that life.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   There's nothing to lean upon. There's nothing to give you pleasure.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   There's nothing to sustain the soul.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   You want food at this point, spiritual food, in your loneliness
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   when you can't go with your boon companions or do the things you've always done.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   You're left to yourself. They're still doing it and here are you alone.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And you've nothing to feed you.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   You don't know how to spend your time, not a while away the weary hours.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Oh, how unproductive and barren and sterile is a life of sin.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And it's the tragedy of so many in the world this evening.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "Without a hope to cheer the tomb," says a line in a hymn.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And isn't it true?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   See, that's the point at which you test life, isn't it?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   When you're dying and when you're going out of it.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Well, that's the time to check up, isn't it?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   You've lived your whole life. What have you got to show for it?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   What about the barns? What about the crops? What about the yield?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   When the final reckoning is made, when the final auditor comes in
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and looks across the books of your life, what does he find?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   What is the yield? What's the productivity?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And the tragedy of a man who's lived without God and without Christ
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   is that he begins to realize at that point he's got nothing at all.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   He hasn't got a character. He's lost it.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   He hasn't a comfort. He hasn't a cheer. He hasn't a hope. He hasn't a prospect.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   He's got nothing. His faculties are exhausted and wearied.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   They're coming to an end. He literally has nothing at all.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He's empty-handed.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Sin, I say, is utterly un- or non-productive.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   No crop.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   But you know, there's something worse than that.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Not only did that land of Israel that was not being cultivated not produce crops,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   it did produce something else instead.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Again, I say, go and look at the garden which is not being cultivated.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   What happens? Ah, weeds begin to grow.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Briars and thorns appear. Thistles and all sorts of things.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Haven't we seen it on these bomb sites in London?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   All sorts of things make their appearance.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Weeds that are useless and are valueless, poisonous, no use to anybody.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   They spring up in abundance.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   That's what you see.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   This is the tragedy of men in sin.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He's not only got nothing ennobling and uplifting and of value to look at
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and to comfort himself and to give to others and to pass on to them.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   The soil of his soul is full of weeds and thorns and briars and thistles.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   What do I mean?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I mean that sin always produces a crop of misery.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Sin always produces a crop of shame.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Sin always produces a crop of remorse and of vain regrets.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It always does. That crop always appears.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Sin always produces suffering.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Invariably.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You cannot sin without suffering following.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   You'll suffer personally.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   You may suffer in your health.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   The man who was so happy last night was terribly miserable this morning
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   with his splitting headache,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   with his stomach upside down as it were,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   in agony, revolted.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   He's paying for it.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   There's always a crop that follows sin and this crop is partly suffering.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And it produces suffering in others.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   The wife of the helpless, hopeless drunkard, the little children,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   the victims of divorce, the innocent victims, the children who've done nothing to anybody.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Oh, the crop of suffering that sin is producing in this modern world of ours, it's appalling.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And then the confusion that it introduces.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   You go and see where the paths are in that garden.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   You go and see where the plots were that used to produce.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   It's all mixed up and it's all in a state of terrible confusion.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And then think of the crop of lying and dishonesty and deceit
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   that always result from sin as they did in the Garden of Eden and have done ever since.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   To cover it over, to pretend that you've not been seen
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and to pretend that you've not done it
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and all the bitterness and the quarrels and all that follows.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   That's the crop, the weeds, the noxious weeds.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   The thorns and the thistles and the briars.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Oh, but there's still one other thing I've got to say
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   and I'm speaking to you strictly accurately
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   in terms of agriculture and horticulture this evening.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   The final thing is this and it's the most astonishing thing.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Did you know that a land like that which is uncultivated
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   and which produces these weeds and these other crops,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   did you know that that land is actually poisoned itself by these other crops that it produces?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   It becomes bitter, it becomes sour, it becomes thoroughly poisoned
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and therefore in a sense it cannot as it is produce a good crop.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   You check up these points with a horticulturalist or with an agriculturalist.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   That is what sin always does to man.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It exhausts him, it poisons him.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   It perverts all his faculties so that they no longer can do what they were meant to do.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   It sours the whole soil.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And man's whole spirit is soured and embittered
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   and rendered sterile as the result of sin.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   That is what I meant when I said that all these ages of sin
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   are always ages of barrenness and of sterility.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   All the highest faculties in man are put out of commission.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Well, there you see is the effect of sin.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   But thank God for this message of salvation.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And the desolate land shall be tilled,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that pass by.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And they shall say, this land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   What a transformation!
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Do you know how it happens?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Well, let me just give you my headings.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   This is how it happens.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   It is all the result of the coming and the life and the death
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   As that is applied unto the soul by the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   What have you got to do to this land before it can become productive again?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Well, here it is, isn't it?
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   You've got to start by clearing it up.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   You've got to get rid of the weeds and the thorns and the sizzles.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   You've got to pull them up and burn them up
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   and uproot them and cleanse the land.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And then you've got to get rid of this sourness and bitterness.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   You've got to drain your land.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   I was staying with a farmer the other day
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and he took me to see a big acreage of land that he'd recently bought
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   which hadn't been cultivated for centuries.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And he showed me how he dealt with it.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   He drained it.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He put a poison, a place for the poison to run out of it
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   to get rid of all this sourness in the land.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And then having done that he'd put lime into it
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   and he'd put other chemicals into it.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   You see, you've got to do something to restore the productivity.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And then he'd ploughed it up and he'd harrowed it.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   He'd smashed and broken it up.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And then he'd put seal into it and had rolled it
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   and the crop was beginning to appear.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   What a wonderful parable of salvation in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Do you know, my friend,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   if Christ hadn't opened that drain which we call Calvary
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   there'd be no hope for any of us.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   What is Calvary?
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Well, it's God's provision for draining the poison of sin out of us.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   It's got to be done.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   And Christ has opened the drain.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Forgive such a term.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   The writer of the hymn says,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   "There is a fountain filled with blood."
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I say, if you like, in my way,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   "Christ has drained the land.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   He's opened the way for the foulness and the sourness
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and the bitterness of sin to be taken out."
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He's taken them away.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And then the Holy Spirit comes
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   and he begins to clear off the weeds and the rubbish
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and to burn them up and he breaks up the land.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   He ploughs, he harrows, he smashes.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Have you known conviction of sin under the Holy Spirit?
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   That's what he does.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   He breaks, he smashes, he breaks us down.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Have you known the process?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   You'll never produce the fruits of salvation
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   unless you've been broken up and ploughed by the Spirit
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and harrowed by the Spirit.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   And then these chemicals, the lime and these other things,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   these phosphates and all these other things that have got to be put in,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   here they are in the Word of God.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   The lime of the law.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   These chemicals of the epistles,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   all these are the things that will increase production.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And then above all, the seed of the Word,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   the seed of life itself.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   He plants the seed of God's own life within the soul.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   And here is a possibility again, you see, of productivity.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And the land will become as the Garden of Eden.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I'm not romancing.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I'm not just giving rain to my imagination.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   This is what Christ does.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   This is the whole story of the church and of Christian salvation.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   This is active. It works.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   It isn't a theory.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   It's God acting in the soul.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And as we've seen what needs to be done,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   we see that it has been done in Christ.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And you know the results?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Well, let me remind you of them.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   The garden begins to look tidy again, doesn't it?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   You don't see thorns now and thistles,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   and those horrible weeds, they've gone.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   And there's order.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   I can see plots.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I can see the paths again.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   You walk into the garden, you say,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   "What a neat, what a tidy garden."
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Or you go around a farm, you say,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   "It's incredible. I remember what it was like."
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   But look at it now.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Oh, when you go to the country, have a look at the landscape.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Look at the hay, the crop of hay,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and then see the corn coming along.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And go out in a few weeks and see the corn beginning to change its color.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Look at the great wheat field,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   being wafted backwards and forwards in the breeze.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And the glory and the beauty and the blending of the color.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Is there anything more glorious to look at
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   than a well-cultivated farm?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   A well-cultivated countryside.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   How magnificent it is.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Tidy and ordered.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Yes, as he says,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   "It begins to look like the Garden of Eden."
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   "The beauty of the Lord be upon us," says the psalmist.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   And then, of course, all this leads to a right use of our faculties.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   When Christ begins to farm your soul
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   through the Holy Spirit,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   you'll find that all that was in you placed there by God
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   begins to be used for the first time and in the right way.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   You'll be aware of powers in yourself that you never knew you had.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Of interests and of possibilities and of likes.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Everything that is ennobling and uplifting will begin to manifest itself.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Oh, let me give you but one illustration.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   It's one of my favorite illustrations.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   There's a great hymn at the beginning of the hymn book
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   by a man called Thomas Olivers.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   It begins with that magnificent arresting line,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   "The God of Abraham praised."
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Praise.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   There was a man who was once a tramp
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   because of sin, because of drink in particular.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   But after his conversion,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   he became not only a fine poet but a great writer.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   That's what sin, that's what Christ does as Savior.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   He removes the sin, he treats the soil,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and the faculties begin to show themselves.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   So that Paul, again in Romans 6, can say,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   "As you yielded your servants as instruments to unrighteousness to sin,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   so yield them as servants and instruments of righteousness unto holiness,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and you'll reap the crop of eternal life."
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Very well, that brings me to the crop.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Oh, the contrast between the saint and the sinner.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   What is the crop?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Well, I read it at the beginning.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   long-suffering, goodness, gentleness,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   faith, meekness, temperance.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   What a crop!
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   The thirteenth of First Corinthians,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   the manifestation of life, of love in the life of an individual,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   everything that is noble,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   contrast with the death of a sinner,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   which I gave you just now, the death of a saint.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   What a difference!
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Oh, the crop of righteousness!
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Oh, the satisfaction of a life in Christ!
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Oh, the comfort in times of trouble!
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Oh, the consolation in times of need!
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Oh, the vision of eternity on a deathbed!
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Whatever the circumstances, more than sufficient,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   a crop, something to rest upon, food, sustenance,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   something to sustain the soul.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   That's the crop that results from salvation which is given by Christ.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   And the most wonderful thing of all is that it increases and goes on.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   The more you till the land, the more you get out of it.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   That's a marvelous thing.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   You're stimulating it, you see, to bring out what's in it.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   You're not exhausting it like the other did.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   You are bringing out the best.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Did you notice the 92nd Psalm?
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   They shall still bear fruit in old age.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   They shall be fat and flourishing.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   It produces, it goes on, produces.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   We grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   We are in a process, according to the Apostle Paul,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   which ends with this,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   "unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   That's the growth.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   The more he tills the land, the better it becomes,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   the more productive.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   You've got rid of all the poison,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   and it's benefiting from the treatment,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   and it grows, and the crop is greater from year to year,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   and it's amazing and astonishing,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   and on and on it goes,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   until at last we arrive in the presence of God,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   and we listen to his divine encomium,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   He knows our works.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Yes, says the book of Revelations,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   their works do follow them,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   and we enter in upon our reward,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   and upon the joy of the Lord.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Oh, my dear friend,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   what of your life, what of your soul,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   what of your productivity,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   what have you got at this moment in your life, in this world?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   I care not how old you are.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   You're old enough to produce some fruit.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Is there any?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Have you got anything you're proud of,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   anything you can lean upon when crisis suddenly comes upon you,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   or some terrifying need that you haven't thought about?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Have you something to show,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   something you're proud of,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   something you can rest on,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   something that holds you and helps you?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Is there a crop,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   or is it sterile and barren and waste and useless?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   It's one or the other.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   And if you feel this evening
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   that you're barren and sterile and waste and useless,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   I say to you, go to God.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Acknowledge it and confess it here and now.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Ask him to have mercy upon you.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Tell him the land is at his disposal.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Ask him to begin the mighty operation.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   You'll never ask him in vain.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   If you ask him and plead with him to do that,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   the Spirit will come, and he'll do his blessed work.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   And you'll feel your sin being drained away in Christ.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   The guilt will have gone.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   He'll begin to deal with the very power of it all,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   and he'll cleanse the land.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And with the new life that he'll put into you,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   you'll begin to produce the fruit of the Spirit
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   to the glory of God,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   to your own enrichment,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   to the enrichment of all who know you,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and to the joy even of the angels of God in heaven.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Thank God for a gospel that can turn a wilderness
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   into the Garden of Eden,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   can come to us barren, miserable failures in life,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   and make of us saints producing graces
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   to the glory of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Amen.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   We do hope that you've been helped
