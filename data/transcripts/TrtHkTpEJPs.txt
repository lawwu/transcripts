[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   And this morning we look together at the words of the Apostle Paul in the first epistle to
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.160]   the Corinthians in the first chapter and the twenty-first verse.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.720]   The twenty-first verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.920]   "For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.120]   the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.480]   For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.960]   the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.400]   Now if we are to get the real import of that statement we must remember the immediate context.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.640]   The Apostle here is writing to these members of the Church at Corinth, and in this section
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.160]   in particular, but in a sense in the whole of the epistle, he is warning them against
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:16.600]   the danger of certain tendencies that seem to have arisen amongst them as Christian people.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.980]   And the main trouble on which he concentrates here is just this, that they were tending
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.440]   to revert to an old way of thinking.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.680]   They were tending, if you like, to go back to the wisdom of men, which we now call philosophy.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   The Apostle says, "Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.600]   wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.440]   Now he has a good deal to say in this entire section about that, and you remember that
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240]   in the epistle to the Colossians he has a similar kind of warning.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.520]   He warns them against philosophy and the rudiments of the world, as he calls it.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   In other words, he is urging these people to beware of that terrible snare, though they
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.360]   were Christians, of going back to an old way of thinking and of looking even upon Christian
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   truth.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.720]   Now here he makes it plain to them that not only was this wrong and false, but he goes
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   further and says that it is something which is entirely destructive of the Christian faith.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.320]   If they go back to that sort of thing, well then, they are really going to cease to be
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   Christians.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.200]   Now, why does he put it like that?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.880]   Well, for this reason.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.440]   He wants to try to show them that apart from the wrongness and the danger of it all, it
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.240]   is incredible folly on their part to go back to that kind of thing, for all that has already
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.960]   been proved to be a failure, and it is because all that has failed so completely and disastrously
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.320]   that God has done this thing which he has done in sending his Son into the world.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   Now that is the essence of the Apostle's argument in this tremendous section, which starts here
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   about verse 17 and runs right on, at least to the end of the second chapter and indeed
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   in a sense into the third chapter also.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.360]   And it is one of the most important statements in the whole of Scripture, and it is particularly
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.680]   important at this present time, because the question which it takes up is this.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.400]   Our whole approach to the gospel—now that is what I cannot understand about you, says
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.320]   the Apostle, in effect, to these Corinthians.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.500]   Having heard the gospel and having believed it, you should even show the slightest tendency
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.320]   to go back into that old philosophical method.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   "Can't you see," he seems to argue with them, "that you are really cutting there at the
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.200]   very foundation of the whole Christian position?"
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.840]   Now, I say that that is as important today as it was at the time when the great Apostle
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.880]   wrote these words to the Church in Corinth.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.700]   Incredible, though it may almost sound to us, this is the particular battle which the
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.300]   Christian faith is having to fight even at this present time.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.260]   It has been the trouble now for a hundred and fifty years or so.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.220]   It has been the whole problem of the attitude which men take towards the Scriptures and
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.240]   to the message of the Scriptures.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   And finally, there are only two positions.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.780]   We either come as little children, as our Lord told us we must come, he said, except
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.260]   to be converted and become as little children, he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.340]   of heaven.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.940]   We either do what the Apostle says to these Corinthians when he puts it in these words,
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.100]   "If any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be made
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.620]   wise."
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.300]   I say we either come in that way, realizing our inability, ready to receive the revelation,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.060]   or else we do what these Corinthians were in danger of doing.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.100]   We approach it all from the standpoint of human reason and human understanding and human
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.740]   philosophy, and we stand in judgment upon it, and we say, "Well, no, this can't
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.100]   be right because on our presuppositions that can't happen.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.740]   There's a great deal here about miracles, but we know that miracles cannot happen.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.740]   Science proves that.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.060]   Well, therefore, that must be wrong."
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.380]   Now, that's the other approach, the philosophical approach, the approach of human reason, the
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.900]   exaltation of man's understanding.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:02.980]   Now, that, I say, is the great fight that is going on even at this present time.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.980]   It takes different forms, but it's very evident in the realm of the Church and of
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.700]   theological thinking at this present time.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.660]   These people who say that the facts are irrelevant, that they don't matter at all—even the
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.100]   virgin birth, the miracles of our Lord, resurrection—irrelevant, they say.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.660]   It's the teaching that matters.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.740]   Now, that's philosophy.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.380]   That is the very thing against which the apostle is warning these Corinthians at this
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.380]   point.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.140]   Well, now, then, let me ask a simple question this morning.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.940]   We are approaching this particular season, and we shall inevitably be thinking about
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.940]   the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, how he came as a man into this world.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.380]   Now, here is the great question.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.220]   What is our view of all this?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.460]   What does it mean to us?
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.780]   What does it represent to us?
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.900]   What exactly do we think is its message?
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.260]   What's its message to us?
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.180]   What's its message to the world?
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.860]   Now, these are the questions that we must ask, because, as we find every year regularly,
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.300]   there are statements made even in the Christian church which are indicative of this approach
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.260]   which the apostle here condemns in writing to the Corinthians, as if Christianity and
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.420]   its message were but some general philosophy, some kind of teaching about life, appeals
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.460]   to industry and to the nations to come together, and things like that, as if that were the
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.460]   essence of Christianity.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.180]   Now, that, I say, is therefore the question that is before us.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.060]   Or, if you like, let's look at it in one question.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.060]   Why did the Lord Jesus Christ come into this world?
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.140]   Why did the Lord Jesus Christ ever come into this world?
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.300]   That's the crucial question.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.660]   And unless we are clear about that question, what right have we to regard ourselves as
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.660]   Christians?
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.660]   Why?
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.860]   Why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.820]   Why was there ever the Incarnation?
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.740]   Now, that is the question, it seems to me, that the apostle helps us to answer in this
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.780]   particular twenty-first verse of this first chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.620]   Let me summarize his teaching.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:22.780]   The first thing he says is this, that he came because men did not know God.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:30.580]   "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.980]   That's why.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.660]   The first reason is that he came because men did not know God.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.980]   Now, this is a very important term.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.940]   It doesn't just mean intellectual knowledge.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.580]   It doesn't just mean knowing about God, or knowing certain things about God.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.340]   Now, we must make this quite clear.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:01.100]   It is obvious that they were defective and deficient, even in that particular respect.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.560]   This same apostle, you remember, in that very important and mighty argument which he has
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.460]   in the second half of his first chapter of the epistle to the Romans, takes up this very
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.260]   matter there.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.140]   He says that mankind is without excuse in its lack of knowledge of God, because the
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.300]   invisible things of him are there from the very foundation of the world.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.540]   So there is much evidence here in the Scriptures which entitles us to say that the pagan world
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:39.020]   at its best and highest was defective even in its general knowledge of God, of God as
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.300]   the creator, of God as the governor of the universe, and such matters.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.460]   The apostle says they are without excuse for their ignorance.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.180]   They ought to have been able to deduce it, but they hadn't done so.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.820]   And you get the same argument in the fourteenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.020]   and indeed in the seventeenth chapter, Paul at Lystra, Paul in Athens.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.260]   Those are the very points which he makes there.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:11.060]   So we see that the world was defective even in its general knowledge of God.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.900]   But that isn't a peculiar thing that the apostle is emphasizing here.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:24.020]   He is emphasizing a much deeper knowledge, a much fuller and a much more experimental
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020]   knowledge.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.220]   Our Lord, you remember, said, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.940]   true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.300]   Now it is possible for us to know things about God and to believe in God, and yet not to
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.980]   know him in that sense.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.980]   That is life eternal.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.540]   There are people who lack life eternal, who haven't got it, who know these general things
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.980]   about God.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:57.100]   But the knowledge of God rarely means, well, a knowledge in the sense of communion with
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.220]   God and of fellowship with God.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.980]   Above all, an ability to enjoy God.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.300]   Now the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world because men lack this knowledge.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:18.900]   They don't know God, when in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:26.460]   You see, the world with its philosophy was speculating, and it is still speculating.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:32.180]   It reasons and it argues and it may arrive at talking about the absolute or some uncaused
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.460]   cause or something like that.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.620]   Now that's what the world does, that speculation, that is philosophy.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.060]   That's not a knowledge of God.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.780]   And this, as I say, is one of the great tragedies of the world and indeed of the Church at the
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.380]   present time.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.940]   We've even been dealing with this in a sense the last few Sundays, so this comes quite
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.380]   appropriately.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.420]   You remember that there in that fourth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, verses 14
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.780]   and 15, we've been looking at words like these, "Let ye be no more children tossed to and
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.900]   fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men and cunning craftiness
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:19.300]   wherein they lie in wait to deceive, but holding the truth in love."
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.940]   And last Sunday morning I was emphasizing this, that the truth is this definite teaching,
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.820]   this doctrine of Christianity, which we are to hold.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.180]   But you see, the whole trouble today is that men, instead of holding that and teaching
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.820]   it, are trying to arrive at it.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.740]   There has been a terrible dearth of true theology and of doctrine for nearly a hundred years.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.740]   Why?
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.460]   Well, because men, instead of starting with the Bible and expounding it and explaining
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.940]   it, have been acting as if we haven't got a revelation at all.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:57.460]   They, by processes of thought, have been trying to arrive at a knowledge of God, and they
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.500]   are trying to define God and to determine God, and they are still doing it.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.260]   It passes as theology; it is nothing but philosophy.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.500]   Man was never meant to arrive at this knowledge.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.300]   Indeed, he cannot, as I am going to show you.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.660]   But he is still trying to do so.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:20.500]   He is still acting and behaving as if Christmas had never happened, as if the Incarnation
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.460]   had never taken place.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.620]   Man is trying to discover God, whereas we are told in the prologue of John's Gospel,
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.700]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.940]   The only begotten was in the bosom of the Father.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.860]   He hath declared him."
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.300]   Now men are behaving as if there were no declaration.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.380]   That is what these Corinthians were trying to do.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.460]   Though the apostle had been there and had been declaring unto them, they had foolishly
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.900]   been listening to certain other teachers, and these had introduced bits of philosophy
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.460]   and speculation, what they called wisdom, and were trying to lead to some higher esoteric
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.460]   knowledge.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.420]   "Why," says the apostle, "you are going back on the Gospel.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.180]   It is not in wisdom of men."
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.180]   No, no.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:09.140]   The Son of God came into this world because men did not know God.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.940]   Don't misunderstand me when I put it like this.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.860]   He didn't come primarily in order to introduce a new ethic.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.140]   He didn't come primarily in order to give a message to statesmen as to how they should
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.420]   solve the international problem.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.980]   He didn't come to tell men in industry on one side or the other how to pull together
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.740]   and to be brotherly and friendly.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.540]   That isn't the primary reason.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.220]   Oh, you're told it endlessly in this New Testament, "He came and did all he did in
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:46.220]   order to bring us to God, to this knowledge of God, to this enjoyment of God, which man
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.180]   had had at his first creation and which he'd lost because of sin."
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.300]   That's the first reason, and we must never put it first.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.860]   But let me go on to show that this is a fact.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.700]   It's not merely a statement, but it is a fact.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:11.660]   I mean by that that it is a literal, actual fact, which is proved by all pagan history,
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:19.580]   that the world at its very best and highest had not arrived at this knowledge of God.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.060]   Now this is to me something tremendous, something which I find to be thrilling.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:35.740]   Greece, at her very zenith, at her acme, in her mightiest thinkers and philosophers, had
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.100]   not been able to arrive at this knowledge.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.980]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.260]   You can read their work still.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.760]   You can study them.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.700]   You can see the efforts and the attempts, the speculating, the suppositions, and at
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.340]   times they almost seem to be getting there, but they never got there.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.540]   They completely failed.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.060]   And this is, I say, one of the great foundations of the presentation and the preaching of the
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.700]   gospel.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.880]   We must assert this fact.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.860]   We are concerned about facts this moment.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.540]   The coming of the Son of God into the world is a fact.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.500]   That's why this is 1957.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.740]   It all goes back to him.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.360]   There is the turning point of all history.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.260]   Very well, but go back beyond that into your history.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.420]   And there it is in your secular textbooks of history and of philosophy and of thought
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:36.220]   that the world at its best and its very highest, standing on tiptoe, could not arrive at this
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.320]   knowledge of God.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.240]   And you see, the tragedy of the modern world is that we are still looking to people like
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.840]   that for guidance.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.320]   All these philosophers, I don't care which, Lord Russell, start with him, any one of them
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   you like, he writes his books, "Why I am not a Christian."
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   Well, what does he say?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.680]   Well, he simply gives you his own speculations and he just proves again that the world by
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.660]   wisdom knew not God and still doesn't know him.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.720]   But what a pathetic belief we have in such people.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.580]   Why should we listen to them?
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.840]   They were proved to be failures before the Son of God ever came into this world.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.560]   They had done their utmost and it had come to nothing, nineteen hundred long years ago
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.700]   and more.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.860]   And yet the world still listens, still wonders whether the answer isn't thus going to come
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.700]   in that particular way and manner.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.380]   Oh, that's the tragedy of the modern world.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.980]   And when you get that kind of thinking creeping into the church, when the church elevates
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:40.960]   and exalts philosophers rather than proclaimers of the Word, she's falling back into this
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.820]   error that so terrified the apostle and made him write this section to the church at Corinth.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.380]   It's a fact.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.380]   But wait a minute.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.740]   It is a fact that can be established in a very remarkable manner.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.340]   You notice how this word puts it?
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:03.880]   "For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   What does this mean?
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.060]   Well, there are two ways of looking at this, and I believe that both of them are true,
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.340]   though the second I'm going to mention, it is generally agreed, is the more accurate
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.060]   itinerant of the two, but certainly not the more important.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:26.900]   "For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.300]   What's this wisdom of God?
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.780]   In the wisdom of God.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:37.660]   Well, I want to suggest that it does mean this partly, that nowhere perhaps do we see
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:46.140]   the wisdom of God more clearly than in the way in which he allowed the world to try and
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:53.700]   to speculate and to endeavor before he sent his Son into this world.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:59.400]   People often ask the question, if it is right, as the Bible teaches, to say that God had
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:05.220]   planned this coming and this redemption before the very foundation of the world, and he had.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.060]   Paul will say that quite explicitly in the second chapter in the seventh verse.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.220]   He says, "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.660]   ordained before the world unto our glory."
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.780]   Very well, people have often asked, if God had decided and determined that before he
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:29.380]   ever created the world or ever created men, before men ever fell in the Garden of Eden,
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:38.980]   why did these four thousand years pass before the Son of God actually came into the world?
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.220]   Why didn't he send him earlier?
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.780]   Why didn't he send him immediately, the moment men fell?
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.020]   Or why didn't he send him at the time of Abram or some such other time?
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:54.460]   Why these four thousand years, when the whole thing was already determined?
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.540]   I am suggesting that a part of the answer to those questions is just this, that it's
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:09.940]   a manifestation of the wisdom of God, in this way, that God knows us so well.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.580]   And he knew perfectly well that if he had sent his Son into the world, immediately men
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.700]   had fallen.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.900]   Men would have said, "Ah, yes, but we could have found out all this ourselves if only
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.140]   he had given us a little time to do so."
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.020]   He sends the answer at once.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.900]   Now if we'd only had to, there's no need for this.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   We could have done it.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.900]   We could have arrived at it.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.340]   Isn't man always ready to say that?
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.060]   He's so proud of himself.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:40.180]   He's so confident of his powers and especially of his understanding, men would have made
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.420]   the claim, "Oh, we could have arrived at it all if only we had been given time."
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.020]   Well, God has given them time.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.100]   He gave them four thousand years.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.980]   He allowed all those great civilizations to rise up.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:08.300]   Babylon, Assyria, Nineveh, China, Egypt, Greece, Rome, all these great dynasties, they were
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.500]   civilizations, call them that, and they made some astounding and amazing discoveries and
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   advances.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.100]   God, in his everlasting and eternal patience, looked on upon it all.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.660]   He gave them a full chance and opportunity.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.740]   He allowed the philosophers to flower and to reach their very acme, as I say.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.260]   And even at their best and at their highest, they couldn't arrive at him.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.940]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.700]   Oh, the amazing wisdom of God.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.580]   Every mouth is stopped.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.460]   If man in his arrogance rises up today and says, "I, by my thinking and speculating,
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.220]   can arrive at a knowledge of God," we simply say this to him, "Are you greater than Plato
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.020]   and Socrates and Aristotle?
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.260]   Do you think that you can get further than they went?
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.820]   Do you think you've got a greater brain and a greater understanding?"
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.940]   No, no.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.620]   The world is left without an excuse.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:12.940]   It was given a full opportunity, a great chance, and it completely failed.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:19.860]   In the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.420]   Oh, the apostle will be emphasizing this later on in this chapter.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.220]   He ends the chapter, you remember, with this verse, "That according as it is written, he
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.580]   that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.900]   He can't glory in himself if he's a true thinker because he sees his failure.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.900]   What has God done?
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.700]   Well, God has done something which has made foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.740]   He's confounded the wise, and he has confounded the things which are mighty by the things
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.240]   which are weak.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.780]   In the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:03.140]   But this can also be taken in a second way, and I would put it in a principle like this.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:10.860]   The utter inexcusability of this failure on the part of men to know God.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.860]   How do you say?
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.860]   Well, like this.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.020]   In the wisdom of God can be interpreted like this.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   In view of the fact, seeing this, surrounded by the wisdom of God, in, you see, the wisdom
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.460]   of God, in the midst of it, in the middle of it, surrounded by it, in the wisdom of
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.780]   God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.340]   So that we can put it like this.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.620]   Man is utterly inexcusable for this ignorance.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.620]   Why?
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:51.380]   Well, because he has thus been surrounded the whole time by the evidence that was necessary,
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.060]   by all these indications of the everlasting and eternal wisdom of God.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]   What are they?
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.020]   Well, I've already mentioned some of them in passing.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.780]   Creation and nature.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.420]   The very argument of Paul in Romans 1, Acts 14 and Acts 17.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:13.980]   These invisible things of him have been there from before the foundation of the world.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:19.780]   His eternal creatorship and creatorhood and power, they're there, says Paul.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.780]   Look at them.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.340]   Analyze your flowers.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.820]   The order, the design, the arrangement.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.980]   Look at it in the animals.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.380]   Look at it in the mountains and the valleys, the rivulets and the brooks and the streams.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.780]   Oh, the perfection of it all.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.380]   See the rain coming down, then the sun absorbing it up again.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.620]   Back it comes again.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:44.700]   The cycles, the seasons, spring, summer, autumn, winter, is all this accident and chance.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.360]   It's impossible, it's incredible.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360]   What is it?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.160]   Well, it's a manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.660]   It's there, creation and nature.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:58.380]   And then in providence, God's providential dealings with men.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.940]   It's a manifestation of his wisdom.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.940]   Work it out.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:09.340]   And then in history, the history of the nations, God's interventions.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:15.860]   Then think of man himself, what can explain man apart from God?
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:23.180]   This little microcosm that suggests the cosmos and that suggests the eternal creator with
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.740]   his everlasting mind.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.540]   If man had only rarely looked at himself and analyzed himself truly, he'd have said, "Oh,
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.060]   I can't account for myself except in terms of someone infinitely bigger in whose image
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]   I've been made."
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.820]   God, the wisdom of God seen in man.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.660]   But man had completely failed.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.340]   He came very near it at times.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.540]   Let's say that for some of the Greek philosophers, sometimes their analysis comes very near,
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.180]   but they never got there.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:55.660]   And then finally, perhaps in the whole story of the Jews, for God had made this people
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.620]   for himself in order that he might address the whole world.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.300]   He made them, he judged them, he did certain things with them and to them.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.780]   Read your Old Testament history and you'll see there's no real explanation except God.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.260]   That little country placed where it was, surrounded by these mighty dynasties.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.440]   How could it stand even for 10 years?
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.940]   But there it stands and sometimes conquers everybody, reigns over all, rises in mighty
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.940]   power.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.060]   It isn't the people.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   It's God.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:30.980]   So the history of the Jews was there before these nations and their wonderful civilizations
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.140]   and philosophers throughout the running centuries, and yet they couldn't see it.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.180]   They didn't understand.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.540]   Sometimes in desperation they almost said, "It's the God of these people," but then they
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.020]   simply thought of him as one amongst their gods.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.660]   They never arrived at this knowledge of the true God, and they're utterly inexcusable.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.180]   In the wisdom of God, surrounded by it, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.980]   Which brings me to my next point.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.860]   The cause of this fact, the cause of this failure on the part of mankind and the world
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.980]   to know God, what is the cause?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.140]   Well, here it is again, quite explicitly.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:21.020]   "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God."
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.220]   That's the trouble.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:30.620]   The trouble, the final trouble, is always man's pride of intellect, man's confidence
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:39.780]   in his capacity to comprehend the incomprehensible, man's refusal to admit his creatureliness,
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:45.660]   man's desire to be as God and to stand up and regard God as an equal, and to be able
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.380]   to measure God and assess God and criticize God.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.940]   Isn't he doing it at this present time?
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.780]   Isn't the world still doing it?
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.980]   Isn't that the objection to the gospel, that it makes fools of us, as it were, asks us
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.640]   to jettison our intellects, says the modern man.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.580]   He has this confidence in his intellect and in its ability to span the everlasting and
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   the eternal.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:11.500]   And the world tried to do it by its own wisdom.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.420]   And it failed, and it failed completely.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.460]   You ask, "Why did the Son of God ever come into this world?"
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:31.940]   And the answer is, as I've been showing you, because men could not find God, because men
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:38.300]   lack this knowledge of the eternal, because men could not enter into fellowship with God,
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:43.300]   could not know him, couldn't answer Job's question, "Oh, that I knew where I might find
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.180]   him!"
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.180]   But he couldn't find him.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:52.220]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.540]   That is why he came.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.540]   That's the first reason, because man doesn't know God.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.820]   But let me hurry to a second reason, which is glorious.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:10.420]   The second reason why he came is this, because it pleased God that he should come.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.780]   Did you notice this word, "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.820]   knew not God"?
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:25.100]   It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.340]   This is a wonderful phrase.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.700]   This translation really doesn't bring it out.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.100]   It would have been better to translate it like this, "When the world, by wisdom, knew
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.540]   not God, it was God's good pleasure."
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.580]   That's it.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.580]   It pleased God.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.940]   It was God's good pleasure by the foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.020]   Oh, that's why we're in this chapel this morning.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.300]   That's why there is such a thing as a Christian church and the Christian message.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   What is it?
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.740]   It's God's good pleasure.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   What do you mean by God's good pleasure, says someone?
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:09.100]   Oh, I mean this, that it was entirely of his own determination.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:15.020]   God in sending his Son into this world was moved by nothing save his own determination,
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.860]   his own good pleasure.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.260]   The Son of God came into this world not because we are as we are, not in answer to our prayers,
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.100]   and petitions, and desires, not at all.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:33.740]   It pleased God, his own good pleasure.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.340]   He was moved and influenced by nothing but his own eternal heart of love.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.700]   It gave him pleasure to do it.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.460]   It pleased God.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:48.020]   There, you see, you put in the whole of the grace, and the love, and the kindness, and
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.820]   the mercy, and the compassion of God.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.980]   Seek out every phrase and word that you can find in all your vocabulary.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.180]   Bring them all out and still they're insufficient.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.180]   Here it is.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.020]   It was his good pleasure.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.620]   Had God been influenced and controlled by us and by the world, he would have destroyed
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.140]   us.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.380]   But he wasn't.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.780]   It was his own thought.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.820]   It was his own desire.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.420]   It came from his own eternal heart.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.540]   It came, I say, from the depths of his own eternal being.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:29.300]   God's uninfluenced, absolute, undetermined will.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:34.620]   It pleased God.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.180]   That I say is why he came.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.460]   That is why we are here.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:47.700]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.180]   Have you thought of it like that, my friends?
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.820]   That in spite of our ill-desert, in spite of our sinfulness and unworthiness, in spite
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:01.300]   of all that is so true of us and of our world, oh God, because he is God, sent him forth,
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   sent him into the world.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.020]   It was his good pleasure.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.260]   I can't add to it.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:11.820]   Or you can look at all that, if you like, from our end and our angle.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.780]   He determined us to be gracious toward us.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.860]   And so this apostle talks about the riches of his grace and the exceeding riches of his
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:27.820]   grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ because of his great love wherewith he loved us, his
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.500]   kindness toward us.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   Those are the terms.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.260]   But it's all, they're all comprehended in this one phrase.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:42.660]   It was God's good pleasure.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.900]   This is at one and the same time the most humbling and the most glorious thought.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:52.100]   It says an eternal no to all man's claims for ability and understanding, of knowledge
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.020]   to know what he needs and what he can do.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.460]   No, says God.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.860]   You've altogether failed.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:08.940]   And Christ came in spite of us because it was God's good pleasure to send his Son into
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.940]   the world.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.860]   And he came, my next and third principle is, he came, of course, therefore to reveal God's
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   wisdom.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:23.420]   The world, by wisdom having failed to know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.940]   preaching, which should be better translated like this, by the foolishness of the thing
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.140]   preached.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.580]   The apostle is not so much talking about the act of preaching as upon the message which
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:40.380]   is preached, the foolishness of the thing preached.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.060]   And you notice his terms.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:49.340]   He calls it foolishness because he knew that it was regarded as foolishness by the Greeks,
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.340]   by the philosophers.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:59.980]   God shows his eternal and everlasting wisdom, what is rarely wisdom, in this thing which
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.580]   seems to be unutterable folly and seems altogether ludicrous.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.980]   But of him, he says, at the end, are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.980]   Wisdom?
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.260]   Wisdom from God?
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.700]   And if we don't rejoice at this this morning, I really wonder whether we are Christians
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.500]   or not.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.100]   You see the divine humor coming out here.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.860]   God manifesting his wisdom and revealing it in a way that appears to the world to be folly.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   What is it?
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:39.140]   It is the Savior of the world, a Jewish babe, Jew of everything, that little nation, that
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:45.860]   little people, conquered at the time as they'd been conquered before, and as a babe not coming
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:53.740]   as a spectacle when the clouds suddenly rent and his appearing insignificant babe in weakness.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.380]   This is God's wisdom.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:09.100]   And into a very poor family, and into a stable, and born of a virgin, and then living the
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.620]   life of an artisan, of a workman, a carpenter.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.480]   Is this the way to save mankind?
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.300]   Is this the way we are going to get the great knowledge and philosophy that we need?
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   Is this it?
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:28.100]   A workman, a carpenter in a little land like Palestine, monstrous, folly, ridiculous.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   How can this man teach having never learned?
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.100]   Who is this fellow?
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.940]   Oh, I mustn't keep you.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:42.980]   And then, that death upon the cross.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   Is this wisdom?
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980]   This is folly.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.940]   This is a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.700]   It is folly to the Greeks.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.180]   Oh, but you and I know that this is God's wisdom.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.260]   Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:03.260]   The only way to bring men back into that knowledge of God, the only way to reconcile men, the
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   only way to put men back where he was, and even above that, what the philosophies of
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.740]   the world have failed to do, God's doing it.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.820]   This is the manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.300]   As you think of that babe, is that your deduction?
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.180]   Do you drop on your knees and praise the everlasting wisdom of God?
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.740]   God's method.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.740]   This is it.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:32.180]   Through the foolishness of the thing preached, we say it's all in him.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.860]   Everything that man needs, wherever he is and whatever he is, it's all there.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.340]   In other words, my last principle I put in this form that he came then in order, as Paul
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.540]   puts it, to save them that believe.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:54.460]   And to save means to bring us back to that knowledge of God which is life eternal.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:37:00.060]   And that means, you see, that we've got to be forgiven, not only for our inexcusable
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:05.780]   failure to discover God, but for our arrogance for ever having thought that we could ever
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.260]   elevate ourselves and stand before him or enter into his presence as equals.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.940]   Oh, there's no sin greater than that.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:17.140]   Get rid of the thought that drunkenness and adultery and things like that alone are sin.
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.980]   There is no greater sin than this, that a man should say, "I have it within me to
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.300]   find God and to stand alone before him."
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.100]   There's no greater sin than that.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:34.260]   And man needs forgiveness for thinking that for a second.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.580]   And it is only here he finds it.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.460]   In this babe that was born and who later died on the cross on Calvary's hill, God was
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:49.940]   in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:56.260]   He has imputed them to him, for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:01.620]   we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.260]   My dear friends, in all your thinking at this present time, do you think like that that
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.740]   Christ came in order to save us?
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.260]   Save us from the guilt of our sins?
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.980]   Save us from the punishment we so richly deserve?
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.860]   Save us for God?
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.620]   Bring us to God?
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:30.020]   Give us a knowledge of God, the ability to enjoy fellowship and communion with God and
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.580]   to delight in him?
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:40.980]   I ask, do we face Christmas like this?
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.820]   Or shall I put it in a last word in this form?
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:51.300]   Are you trying to understand the Incarnation?
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.900]   Are you falling into the error of Zacharias and Mary?
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.860]   You remember both of them stumbled when the announcement was made.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860]   Impossible!
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.420]   How can I and my wife Elizabeth have a son, said aged Zacharias?
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.620]   The thing is impossible at our age.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.620]   And he was struck dumb.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.620]   Why?
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.420]   He was trying to understand the miraculous, trying to understand God.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.620]   Mary says, how shall this be?
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.460]   It's impossible, seeing that I have never known a man.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:22.500]   She was trying to understand and was rebuked.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.260]   So I feel that that is the great question that comes to us.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.980]   Are we guilty of this folly of which these Corinthians were becoming guilty?
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.460]   Of having believed the truth once, then going back and trying to understand it?
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.820]   And because we can't understand at certain points, dropping this doctrine and that doctrine
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.300]   as so many are doing today.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.860]   Are you trying to understand the Incarnation?
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.220]   You never will, so give up now.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.900]   Just accept it adoringly and thank God and worship him and praise him for it.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.300]   Are you trying to understand the virgin birth?
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.580]   Are you saying I can't believe the virgin birth because it doesn't seem to me to be
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.580]   scientific?
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.540]   And indeed I believe that scientists are soon going to establish this path on a genesis.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.540]   Is that your attitude?
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.540]   Are you in trouble?
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   Are you in any difficulty?
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.060]   If so, you're back with Zacharias and Mary and you need to be rebuked.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.220]   You'll be struck dumb in some shape or form.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.740]   You have been struck dumb.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.520]   If it's because you're like that, you don't really know God and are not enjoying fellowship
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   with him.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.740]   Cease from philosophy.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.140]   Cease trying to understand.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.460]   And I will never understand the person of Christ, the two natures in the one.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.460]   I can't understand this.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.060]   And the moment anybody says that to me, I say, look here, as long as you're speaking
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.700]   like that, I can't help you either.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.460]   The first thing you've got to do is to realize you'll never understand.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.740]   I'm not explaining things to you that can be understood and comprehended.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:49.020]   I am announcing with God nothing shall be impossible.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.700]   And he has done the impossible.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.780]   And God, praise God, that he has, for nothing but miraculous supernatural action, could
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.540]   ever redeem me and get rid of my sins and introduce me to God.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.420]   But God can, and God has done it, and he's done it in his Son.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.300]   Are you trying to understand the atonement?
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.700]   If you are, of course you don't believe it, because it can't be understood.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.060]   It is to be accepted.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.340]   It is the proclamation.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.940]   It is Christ who teaches it.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.740]   He expounded it from the scriptures.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.260]   The apostles, given the revelation and the authority, taught it, and you and I must believe.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.060]   Don't try to understand the atonement.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.100]   Don't try to understand the resurrection.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   Cease from this folly of mankind, which before Christ ever came, had been proved to be a
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.700]   complete failure.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.500]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.540]   Well why try still to understand the incomprehensible?
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:51.580]   Let us rather look with adoring wonder and amazement at what it has pleased God to do,
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:57.020]   to send his Son out of the eternal glory as a babe into that stable in Bethlehem, and
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:03.140]   then finally to the cross, stand and look at it, ask for the Spirit to enlighten you,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:09.060]   and then get down on your knees and worship him and praise him and magnify his matchless
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   grace.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   It pleased God.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:20.260]   It was his good pleasure in this way to save them that believe.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.260]   That is why he came.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.820]   Thank God.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.780]   He came to give us this second birth.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.580]   He came to make us children of God.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:38.580]   He came to give us the knowledge of God, which is life eternal.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.500]   Amen.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.420]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
