[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   What do you think someone gets from being more intentional with their time?
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.520]   Time is your most precious asset. And like in your prior episode, where you were talking about
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.240]   making more time, we talked about a lot today is not making more of it, but making the best use of
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.440]   it using it more intentionally. When you use your time more intentionally, you get better outcomes,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.400]   you're investing that time in something that has a higher ROI. And so everything that we're talking
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   about that doesn't mean you're making more money with your time, but it means you're using it more
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.000]   intentionally, where you're going to experience higher benefits than you would have otherwise.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.160]   And that applies to all of these areas, it might be productive time where you're pushing and
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.560]   working on things, it might be solitude, where you're just creating space, where you're slowing
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.960]   down, where you're going for walks, it might be intentional listening, where you're with people,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.200]   and you're really thinking about what's the best way to create these feelings of connection and to
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   develop these relationships of love and support, all of those things, create better outcomes on
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   on the same one unit of time.
