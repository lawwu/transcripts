[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right, let's do one more question here. This one comes from David.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   David asks, how do you deal with unpredictable autopilot schedules?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   He elaborates, I'm a graduate student in mechanical engineering. Sometimes my professors do not post or assign homework on the same time every week,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   which gets in the way of my attempts to automate my coursework so I can focus on research.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   How can I construct an autopilot schedule that takes into account the unreliabilities of my professors?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Well, David, first of all, you have plenty of time because you're a graduate student,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and when you're a graduate student, you feel like it's the hardest thing that has ever happened.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And as soon as you graduate from being a graduate student, have any type of real job,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   you look back and say that is the easiest possible job you can have.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Everything seems hard while you're there, but you have a ton of autonomy and a ton of time.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So I'm not too worried. I'm not too worried about your situation here.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This is what I would suggest. Have two core blocks every day.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And these get split between research and coursework.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And you can make assignment changes as needed throughout the week.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So maybe if you don't get your homework till Tuesday,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   you're going to take a one of these two blocks on Wednesday and one of the two blocks on Thursday to do the homework.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And if another week you get assigned to work at the end of day Friday,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   then maybe you're taking the two blocks on Monday.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And this is all being done with coursework.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So just make a just in time binding of work type to the predetermined blocks.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But the key thing is these predetermined blocks happen every day.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I do this in the morning, maybe do a block in the morning,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   then I go exercise and do some other things.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And then I do a block in the afternoon.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And here is where I go to do them.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And here is the coffee I bring in. It's automated. I don't even have to think about it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Most of those blocks are me doing research.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Some of them are me working on coursework.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Which is which? Well, it depends on when these devious, unreliable professors decide they are going to assign them.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And we are a devious bunch. We try our hardest to make your life hard.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But I think in this case, you are going to win by doing just in time binding on your autopilot schedules.
