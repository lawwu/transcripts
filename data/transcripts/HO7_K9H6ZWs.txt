[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Dr. David Palveson is a biblical counselor and the author of some very important books
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.180]   and journal articles, resources that perhaps could lead some to see as promoting Christian
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.600]   growth apart from the local church.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   But of course that would be misleading, as he explained to me a few years back when I
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.120]   sat down with him at the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation offices near Philadelphia.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.460]   I asked him to explain the vital role the local church plays in growing in sanctification,
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.480]   in our growth in holiness.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.720]   Local church is integral to sanctification in all sorts of, from all sorts of different
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   directions.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.380]   There's an obvious direction I'll come at second and there's a less obvious one.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.740]   Every single fruit of sanctification gets expressed within the context of the church.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:00.280]   And so if sanctification, if the payoff, to quote 1 Timothy 1.7, "The goal of our instruction
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.960]   is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith."
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.400]   That love gets expressed in the church.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.080]   It gets expressed towards brothers and sisters.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.840]   In the Apostle John's first letter, it's the, you know, if you love the son, you love the
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   brethren.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.540]   You know, if you love the father, you love the children.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.160]   If you, if you are in Christ, you are in some intrinsic way wedded to the welfare of others.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.880]   And so I'm going to get to second, the way the church blesses us in sanctification.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.680]   But the very goal of sanctification involves the church.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.360]   There is a sense, I am not perfected until you are perfected.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.480]   We are not perfected until every single one of us, the children of the living God, is
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480]   perfected.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.500]   Which means another person's struggle, I have a stake in that for my sanctification.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.400]   Sanctification is not a private endeavor.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's not a moral self-improvement project.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.240]   It's not, it's not less than that, but it's so much more than that because the actual
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.160]   things that are improved about us actually tie us to the welfare of other people.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   I think this is part of why you see in Paul this, "Who does not stumble?"
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.760]   And I just, I burn.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   I'm so grieved.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   I'm so concerned.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   You're on my heart.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040]   I wrestle for you.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.600]   There's tears on the piece of paper.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.720]   Is it just because Paul is a particularly passionate Mediterranean personality or is
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.280]   it that Paul knows that our glory, which is the ultimate goal of sanctification, is when
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.200]   all of us arrive together and all of us together have grown up into the image of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.160]   So where else will I express the fruits of growth but with my brothers and sisters?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   Where else will the gifts that God has given me to be the vehicles in which my sanctification
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.080]   is most fruitful, where else will they be expressed if the body of Christ, Christ's
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.920]   own beloved people, is not part of it?
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.600]   We are called to do good to all, of course, but especially to the household of faith.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.680]   There's something about the nature even of God's election that it is an elect people,
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   a holy priesthood is a nation called to be a light to the Gentiles, a light to the world.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.360]   The whole world will know that we are his disciples if we love each other.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.480]   And so evangelism and world missions from a certain point of view hinges, my ability
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   to contribute to that hinges on whether I love the brethren, whether we as Christian
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.800]   people resolve our differences, treat each other with forbearance, patience, humility,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.360]   constructive love, whether we're candid to reprove in a constructive and loving way and
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.440]   so forth.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   Am I about the business of a kingdom that is not my own?
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.800]   And if to the degree I am, it will involve me with other people.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.200]   That's I think the less talked about side.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.120]   The more obvious side is that I need my brothers and sisters.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.480]   We can't say it's impossible to grow without fellowship because there are people in solitary
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.320]   confinement who have grown deep and rich and wise in the ways of the Lord.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   But the normal way that we grow, barring extreme circumstances, you know, you're the only Christian
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.280]   in a Muslim village in Algeria, or you're in prison, or you're elderly and extremely
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.480]   frail and disabled, and for whatever reason, there's no people around you that can support
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   your faith.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.920]   Barring those extremes, I need others.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   From whom else will I receive all of the one-anothering that the Bible says we need to give each other?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.160]   Where else will I hear the word preached, but in the context of corporate worship?
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.720]   Where else will I be reminded through the Lord's Supper and baptism that this King,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   He stoops to meet us?
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.120]   He's not just a head trip.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960]   It's a, "Here's my body, here's my blood.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.720]   These are the waters of life.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.080]   Your sins are washed away.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.400]   Partake of the feast.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.560]   Repent of your sins.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.160]   You really are forgiven.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.040]   You really are washed."
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.080]   Where else do I get the incalculable thing that happens in public worship that is alive
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.960]   where I can sing a hymn when I'm by myself.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.640]   Let me tell you, I'm glad that joyful noise counts unto the Lord, but there's nothing
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.040]   like singing with a pastel of other believers who mean it.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.160]   I'm sure most of us have had that experience where, and there's points where you can't
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.320]   even sing because it is so awesome.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.040]   We're singing to each other and to the Lord, and it is so awesome what we are saying to
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:06.160]   the Lord and to each other and how profoundly corporate worship, just what that does for
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   our sanctification.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.600]   So, yeah, do we need the body of Christ?
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.200]   Yeah, at both ends of the process.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.520]   We need it at the input end to help us grow.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.960]   Oh, in fact, how could I forget?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.120]   When I was being interviewed for church membership, my final question was, "If I stray from my
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   fidelity to Jesus Christ or my wife, what will you do?"
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   And it was a huge comfort for the pastor to say, "I will pursue you.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   I will call you to repentance.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.080]   And if you don't repent, we will excommunicate you."
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.800]   I said, "I'm signing on."
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.000]   There are shepherds who are looking out for my soul.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   Does that mean you can't be a solo Christian?
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.600]   Well, of course not, but God can sustain people in tough times.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.800]   But boy, the norm and the goal is the body of Christ living and active.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.340]   That's brilliant and beautiful.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.280]   That was biblical counselor and author Dr. David Powelson speaking from the offices of
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   the CCEF in Philadelphia.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.680]   Dr. Powelson's books include Speaking the Truth in Love and Seeing with New Eyes.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.160]   Well, anxiety and worry are part of the human experience in this fallen planet.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.640]   But what do they say about the condition of our souls and how should we respond?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   We will hear from Dr. Ed Welch tomorrow.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.280]   I'll see you then.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.860]   [END]
