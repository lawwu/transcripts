[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   No, your podcast feed isn't broken.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.800]   We didn't have any new episodes for the past week or so due to an unusually busy start
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.740]   to 2019 for Pastor John, but we're back in the studio today.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.280]   And hopefully we can avoid those gaps in the future with the schedule.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.440]   If it does happen again, like last time, I'll let you know in the outros of the episodes
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.440]   again.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.960]   Today's question comes from a podcast listener named Lynette.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.240]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.660]   It has been so helpful over the last couple of years.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.600]   Over and over in the Bible, God tells us to rest in Him.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.120]   When I'm going through trials of various sorts or even in good times, I don't exactly know
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.400]   what it means to rest in Jesus.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.920]   I'm a naturally anxious person, so I need to learn it."
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.640]   Pastor John, what would you say to Lynette?
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   Probably the best thing we can do here is let the precious Word of God speak rest to
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.080]   Lynette and to all of us, our souls.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.280]   So let me just speak the first precious Word that came to my mind when I heard this question,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.720]   Matthew 11, 28.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.720]   "Come to me," this is Jesus talking, "come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.760]   and I'll give you rest.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.120]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.080]   find rest for your souls.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.720]   For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520]   Those are amazing words from the Lord of the universe.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   So the first thing we see that's so obvious is He really does want Lynette and you and
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.000]   me to rest.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600]   He wants us to enjoy rest of soul.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.040]   He wouldn't be saying this if it weren't His happy desire for our souls.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.280]   He wants His followers to have deep, sweet restfulness of soul, not anxiousness.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.240]   And the second thing that's obvious here is that the restfulness is not inactive, but
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   a way of active living and doing and serving with deep restfulness of soul, and I think
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.320]   sweet restfulness of body when the day's doing is over.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.240]   And the reason I say that is because here's what He says, "Come to me, I will give you
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   rest.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   So a yoke is an instrument of labor.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.760]   When you've got a yoke on, you're plowing or pulling a wagon or something like that.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.560]   And He makes clear this yoke is His teaching.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.160]   Like the Jews thought of the law as a yoke.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.760]   Jesus said, "No, I've got a yoke for you.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.840]   It's my teaching.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.240]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:14.160]   Just like Jeremiah 6, 16, "Ask for the ancient paths where the good way is.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.320]   Walk in it and find rest for your souls."
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.040]   So it's rest in a walking, not rest from a walking, but rest in a walking.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   But what keeps the yoke, this is what we should ask, I think, is what keeps the yoke, this
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.480]   restfulness from being heavy and burdensome.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920]   Because He says, "My yoke is easy."
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   If it's a yoke and it's a burden, those are His words, how can it be easy and how can
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.600]   it be light?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.320]   What's the difference between His burden, His yoke, and the Pharisees who heaped up
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.640]   legal burdens upon people?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.920]   And here's what He said, Matthew 23, 4, "They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:18.480]   them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger."
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.300]   That's Jesus' diagnosis of the difference between His burden and their burden.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.360]   They don't lift a finger to lighten the load of the law on the backs of people.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.900]   And Jesus not only lifted His finger, He lifted the cross, He lifted His whole life.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.460]   The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.420]   I mean, it's amazing, just stop and think of it.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.340]   The Lord of the universe, the Creator of all things, did not come to be served.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.380]   How amazing can it be?
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.580]   But to serve and give His life as a ransom, that's the main way He served, He gave His
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.980]   life as a ransom.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.580]   So when He says in this beautiful passage about rest, "I'm gentle, I'm lowly, and that's
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.380]   the reason my burden is light and my yoke is easy, because I'm gentle and lowly."
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.420]   What He meant was, "I'm not a hard slave master.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.100]   I don't stand over you with a whip, crack, crack.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.740]   Do my word, crack, crack.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.900]   I get down low underneath you, and I lift you up."
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.540]   Philippians 2, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.720]   on a cross.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.600]   So here's my question.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.640]   How do we talk about this easy yoke where our souls are restful?
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.600]   And I think Paul would say, "Talk about it like this," Philippians 2, 12, "Work out your
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   salvation."
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.480]   So there's your yoke, right?
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   Work.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.800]   "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.440]   And then here's the opposite of the Pharisees.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:08.240]   "For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:20.280]   In other words, Jesus has lifted the heaviest load of guilt and sin by dying for us, and
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:28.160]   He has also lifted and goes on lifting the daily load of working out our salvation by
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:36.080]   being the decisive worker in our lives by the Spirit, the Spirit of Christ within us.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.560]   So let me close with just a story that I think captures it.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.280]   I might have quoted this before in an episode.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   I can't remember.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380]   I just love it so much.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.760]   This is John Patton, the missionary to the New Hebrides in the South Pacific in the 19th
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.280]   century, and it illustrates how the yoke of Jesus, the Word of Jesus, the promise of Jesus,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.040]   once you put it on, leads you to do some pretty crazy things like go be a missionary among
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:12.280]   cannibals, but in the midst of crisis becomes the sweetest soul-supporting thing imaginable.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.240]   So here He is, having served on the Island of Ten.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.280]   The natives have been mobilized against Him.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.000]   Hundreds of them, even with muskets and with knives, are trying to find Him and kill Him.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.480]   He needs to get on a boat and escape quickly, and He has one man that He can barely trust
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   who says, "Climb up in that tree and stay there while they go underneath, and I will
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.040]   lead them down this path.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.520]   You go on that path when they're gone."
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.720]   He had no idea whether he could trust this man, so he climbs up in the tree, and years
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.440]   later here's what he describes.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.840]   "The hours I spent there live all before me as if it were yesterday.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.600]   I heard the frequent discharging of muskets and the yells of savages, yet I sat there
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   among the branches as safe in the arms of Jesus.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   Never in all my sorrows did my Lord draw nearer to me and speak more soothingly in my soul
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.120]   than when the moonlight flickered among those chestnut leaves and the night air played on
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.040]   my throbbing brow as I told all my heart to Jesus.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.520]   Alone yet not alone, if it be to the glory of God, I will not grudge to spend many nights
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:38.280]   alone in such a tree to feel again my Savior's spiritual presence, to enjoy His consoling
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.680]   fellowship."
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:46.160]   And then he closes by looking us in the eye and saying, "If thus thrown back upon your
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.200]   own soul alone, all alone in the midnight, in the bush, in the very embrace of death
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:58.360]   itself, do you have a friend that will not fail you then?"
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.480]   I'll tell you, when I first read that, I said, "Oh, Jesus, I want that kind of friendship
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480]   like nothing else."
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   That's our question.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.080]   Do we have a friend that will not fail us at every moment when we feel restless and
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.680]   anxious?
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.400]   And the answer is, He's right here saying, "Come to me.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.640]   I will give you rest."
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   Amen.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   Greater love has no one than this, than someone lay down his life for his friends.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.280]   Indeed, Christ is our very best friend.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.240]   Well, as we talk, Pastor John is preparing to embark on an international trip to South
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.000]   America this month.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   I'll ask him about it next time and give you some of the details.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   That's on Friday.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   Amen.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   Amen.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   Amen.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:10:00.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
