[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.900]   I want to introduce Mike Piper.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   Mike, I think, needs no introduction.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.860]   He is on our Bogle Center board.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.100]   He's currently our treasurer.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.020]   He's also just, as you would expect, a jack of all trades.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980]   So in terms of like making fixes to our Bogle Center website
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900]   and managing the books for our group
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.660]   and being a wonderful speaker who we can call upon
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.340]   to address any number of topics, Mike is our guy.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.580]   So we are so excited to have him here.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.780]   He's the author of several books, really helpful,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.140]   shorter books, as well as the Oblivious Investor blog.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.440]   Mike, come on up here.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.740]   Thank you.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.340]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.980]   >> So just like Christine said, a dynamic that's super common
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580]   in couples is for one partner, one spouse to be the one
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.780]   who is primarily in charge of the financial decisions.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.700]   So they're the household's financial manager, essentially.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.060]   And then the other partner is somewhat less involved
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.660]   with those decisions.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.580]   And this talk is specifically for that less involved partner.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.340]   And there are two reasons, really,
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.060]   why we wanted to have this talk.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.080]   Reason number one is that even if you aren't the one in charge
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.780]   of this job right now,
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.860]   someday it might become your responsibility.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.780]   And most of the time when that happens,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.580]   it's the result of the D scenarios, death, disability,
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.900]   or divorce, which, of course, aren't happy things.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.940]   So we don't like to talk about them.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.340]   But if that does happen, and this job does land in your lap,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.980]   we want you to be prepared,
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.380]   rather than feeling overwhelmed or lost.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.060]   And when I say that we want you to be prepared,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.180]   I don't just mean the John C. Vogel Center
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.660]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.620]   I mean all of the people in this room
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.060]   who are the household financial managers.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.700]   We, collectively, want you to be prepared,
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.300]   because this is a thing that we think about.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.620]   We worry about it all the time.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.460]   This is one of the most common questions I hear
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.860]   from people is, how can I prepare my partner
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.140]   in case something happens to me?
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.060]   And the second reason why we wanted to have this talk,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.260]   I often think of it this way.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260]   If spouse A is the financial manager,
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.100]   then spouse B's job, with regard to the finances,
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.740]   is to be the oversight committee.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.180]   And that is an important job.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.620]   And I want to share with you just two quick stories
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.260]   to illustrate what I mean by oversight
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.700]   and how important that role can be.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.660]   So the first story, this is a little while ago.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.580]   I was at the climbing gym with a friend.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.780]   And between routes, so this is basically during a break,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.820]   he asks me, "Mike, what do you think about Tesla stock?"
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.060]   And so this is somebody who knows I work
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.020]   in the financial industry just sort of broadly,
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020]   but we've never talked about any details, right?
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.220]   So we've never talked about index funds or bogleheads
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.940]   or anything at all like that.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.820]   So I just said something to the effect of,
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.220]   I don't ever buy individual stocks.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.420]   I just use index funds.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.700]   Are you thinking about investing in it
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.620]   or what's on your mind?
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.140]   What's going on here?
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.860]   And he shares a little bit more information.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.380]   And there's two super critical facts, it turns out.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.980]   Fact number one about the situation
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.420]   is that he has already invested about half
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.380]   of the household's total savings in this one company's stock.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.900]   Fact number two that I found especially noteworthy
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.740]   is that his partner, his spouse, she's got no idea.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.260]   She's completely unaware of the situation.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.180]   And it wasn't because he was doing anything sneaky.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.220]   Like that's not what this was at all.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.340]   It was just that that's how they've divvied up
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580]   the responsibilities in their household.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.980]   She's delegated this job to him.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.580]   He's in charge of the investing decisions.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.140]   He made what he thought was a good decision.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.620]   And the result is that now she's exposed to this huge risk,
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.460]   not because of a decision that she directly made
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.500]   and she has no idea.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300]   And so that's one of the ways
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.020]   that oversight can be so valuable
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.420]   is that even if you're not the one making these decisions,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.700]   you're still affected by them.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.220]   And so checking in every once in a while
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.700]   and just making sure that you have an idea
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.940]   of what's going on,
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.140]   because you might have some opinions about it,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.380]   that can be a good idea.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.700]   And the second reason that oversight is so important,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.300]   mogul heads love to talk about investing, right?
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.820]   If you're married to one, you probably know this.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.020]   But sometimes we need to be reminded
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.940]   that investing is just one piece of financial planning.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.220]   There's a lot more to it than that.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.700]   And to share a story to illustrate this point,
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.020]   several years ago, I received an email
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.180]   from somebody who is a very regular poster on the forum.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.220]   So as of this point, he had already made thousands of posts.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.900]   And if you read his writing,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.020]   you can tell that he's super knowledgeable
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.540]   about a whole list of investing topics.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.620]   So he can talk about asset allocation,
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.700]   mutual fund selection, rebalancing strategies,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.500]   and just on and on and on.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.100]   And this email that he sends me,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.820]   this is, by the way, the first one-on-one interaction
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.660]   I've ever had with him.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.860]   So it's basically out of the blue.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.740]   And it's a tax question.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.180]   And he outlines the circumstances.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.980]   And the very short summary is that he and his wife
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.380]   have been underpaying their taxes
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.180]   to the tune of like $20,000 to $30,000 a year
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.660]   for the last several years.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.780]   And he's just figured this out.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.380]   'Cause again, not a situation
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.860]   where he was trying to do anything wrong.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.900]   They had just made a tax decision at the start of this period
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.780]   that they didn't understand the ramifications of.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.740]   And so now they collectively owe the IRS
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.140]   a big pile of money.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.380]   And when I think back to that situation,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.860]   because even though it was several years ago,
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.020]   it really struck me.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.500]   What I see is this person who had put
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.940]   an enormous amount of time and effort
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.020]   into learning about investing,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.420]   and studying investing, and discussing it on the forum,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.380]   and sharing his thoughts.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.660]   And he just didn't put enough time
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.700]   into the other parts of financial planning.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.220]   And so they made this big, costly mistake.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.580]   And so that's what I want to do this morning.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.260]   I want to go through the primary areas
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.340]   under the financial planning umbrella,
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.140]   and just give you a checklist
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.340]   of the most common, most critical items
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.180]   under each of those topics.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.580]   And the idea is that you can go over this together
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.220]   so that number one,
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.700]   if the person who is not the household's financial manager,
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.380]   if they become the financial manager at some point,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.820]   they're better prepared.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.620]   And number two, so that we can make sure
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.420]   nothing important is being left out.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.900]   So the first topic we have is cash flow.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.660]   That's all of the budgeting-related stuff.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.060]   Risk management, that's the insurance stuff.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.100]   Investing, retirement planning,
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.740]   estate and charitable planning,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.900]   education planning, so that's saving for college,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.500]   and tax planning.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.220]   And again, this is gonna be a checklist
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.220]   of the most common, critical items.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.780]   And to warn you, it's gonna feel a little bit
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.340]   like information overload,
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.100]   but I've got a few pieces of good news there.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.020]   Number one is that these slides are already available
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.980]   on the Bogle Center website,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.740]   so you don't have to remember all of it.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.740]   Number two is that this job gets easier over time.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.620]   The more often you go over this together,
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.460]   the easier it is,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.500]   because you only have to go over what's changed.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.980]   And the other thing about this is that,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.420]   for some households, maybe it makes sense
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.900]   to have the once-a-year money talk,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.300]   where you just knock out the whole thing.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.820]   I don't think that's very common.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   What I see a lot more often,
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.340]   and this is what my wife and I do,
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.340]   is we have a once-a-month money talk.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.980]   And so this month, we're talking about cash flow.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.780]   Next month is the insurance stuff.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.780]   Investing the next month.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.540]   So it's just smaller, more digestible chunks, basically.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.900]   So diving right in, in cash flow planning,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   the first question we wanna know
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.380]   is just how much are we spending every month?
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.340]   And then how much do we spend every year?
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.180]   Because it varies from month to month, right?
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.060]   There's a lot of things that we only pay for once a year,
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.860]   certain insurance premiums,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.940]   or maybe you take a vacation every summer.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.340]   So if you just look at last month's spending
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.620]   and multiply by 12,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.740]   that doesn't really tell you
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.180]   how much you're spending over the year.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.980]   So we wanna know typical monthly spending,
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.900]   typical annual spending.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.380]   And what are we spending on?
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.340]   So we know this is how much we're spending,
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.500]   but if we categorize it,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.060]   we're spending this much on housing,
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.020]   this much on groceries,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.740]   this much on entertainment,
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.420]   and then does that align with our values?
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.900]   Because sometimes when you take the time
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.940]   to actually break it down
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.260]   and see that order of which you're spending,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.980]   most on this, next most on this,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.380]   you realize that it makes a little bit of sense
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.020]   to scale back a little here
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.180]   so you can spend somewhat more there
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.980]   on something that you care more about.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.820]   And one last thing about spending
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.100]   that I always like to look at
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.140]   is subscription costs.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.020]   'Cause these days, everything's a subscription.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.620]   I always think about, as a CPA,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.660]   I use Microsoft Excel all the time.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.860]   And when I started in this field,
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.900]   you would buy a copy of Microsoft Office,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.740]   which you would install on your computer,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.580]   and then you just had Microsoft Office.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.380]   And now you buy a subscription to Microsoft 365,
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   and you pay for that every month forever.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.340]   And TV's the same thing, right?
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.740]   You sign up for all these different streaming services,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.740]   and I see this pretty often,
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.220]   that people will have maybe seven different services,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.900]   and they're only using two of them.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.980]   So it makes sense every once in a while
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.940]   just to look at what your subscription costs are
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.820]   and see if there's anything we can cut out.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.140]   Another important question still in the cash flow space.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.780]   So this is specifically for accumulators,
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.940]   so people who are still saving
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.740]   towards financial independence and retirement.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.220]   What we wanna know is how much are we saving each month,
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.580]   and does that put us on track for our goals?
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.740]   So what evidence do we have?
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.020]   That's what we wanna see here.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.980]   We wanna know, did we work
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.820]   with some financial planning software,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.180]   or an actual financial planner,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.820]   or at the very least, a spreadsheet analysis?
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.060]   What evidence do we have to think
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.500]   that if we keep doing what we've been doing,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.380]   we will end up where we want to end up?
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   And for retirees, it's basically the same question,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.780]   it's just kinda the flip side of the coin.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.860]   Are we on the right track?
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.980]   Is the amount that we're spending sustainable?
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.420]   And again, what evidence do we have?
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.340]   Was it a spreadsheet analysis, financial planning software?
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.300]   We wanna see something to back that up.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.860]   Another important question that we wanna check off
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.100]   is that we have a sufficient emergency fund,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.220]   and you'll often hear people say
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.820]   that three to six months of expenses
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.540]   is the appropriate size for an emergency fund,
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.220]   but in reality, it varies,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.660]   because the biggest reason why people tap
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.980]   into their emergency fund is because they lose their job,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.300]   and so you're spending from your savings
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.220]   for however long until you get the next job,
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.900]   and so the appropriate emergency fund size
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.740]   depends on your job.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.820]   So if you're a government employee
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.300]   in a very secure position,
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.020]   you can get away with a smaller emergency fund
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.500]   than somebody who is a software developer
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.060]   at a startup company.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.300]   And the most extreme example of that
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.900]   is anybody who's already retired,
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.700]   they don't really have a risk of job loss anymore, obviously,
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.860]   and if their portfolio's already big enough
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.300]   to satisfy the spending,
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.620]   they don't really need an emergency fund.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.620]   There isn't usually a need
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.180]   to carve out a separate piece of it
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.660]   and just call it the emergency fund,
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.420]   the portfolio can just do that job.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.300]   So that's it for cash flow planning,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.300]   which was our biggest topic.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.620]   Insurance is our second biggest topic.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.340]   First question is simply,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.460]   what types of insurance do we have,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.540]   through which companies,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.780]   and where can I find the details?
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.620]   And with regard to this last question,
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.340]   where can I find the details,
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.060]   the ideal situation would be
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.260]   that you don't really have to think about it.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.220]   It should be like the question of where's my toothbrush?
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220]   Right, you know where that is without extra thought,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.220]   and the reason that that's so important
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.060]   is that if you think about a scenario
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.660]   where you one day suddenly need to know
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.860]   is something in particular covered
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.300]   under our homeowner's policy,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.020]   something went wrong that day,
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.180]   so it's probably a stressful day,
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.940]   and you don't need this to be another source of stress
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.180]   just 'cause you don't know where the information is.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.220]   And then the thing that happens
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.220]   in the insurance space sometimes
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.660]   is the two most common mistakes I see
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.260]   are number one, that people will simply not realize
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.420]   that there's a particular type of coverage
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.460]   that they should have and they don't have it,
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.820]   and the other one, relatedly,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.460]   is that they realize that this type of coverage
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   is important, so they have some coverage in that space,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.540]   but they don't realize that it leaves
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.060]   something important out.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.820]   And disability insurance is the perfect example
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.940]   of both of these because this happens all the time,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.140]   that young people who are still not even close yet
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.340]   to financially independent,
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.940]   they couldn't retire at all today,
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.020]   they very much are dependent on their job income,
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   they don't have disability insurance,
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.540]   and that exposes you to a huge risk.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.060]   And I made an offhand comment last year,
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.460]   and immediately after that session,
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.860]   multiple people came up and said,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.500]   "Oh yeah, I don't have disability insurance.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.340]   "What do I do?
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.180]   "How do I get that?
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.580]   "What should I look for?"
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.100]   And so this happens all the time.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.020]   And then relatedly, a lot of a common scenario
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.940]   is that people will know
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.060]   that disability insurance is important,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.300]   and they'll know that they have coverage
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   through their employer, and so they'll think,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.340]   "Great, that box is checked off."
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.460]   But they don't realize that the employer coverage
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.900]   is short-term.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.340]   So maybe it only pays for three months
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.860]   or six months of benefits.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.900]   And of course, if you think about it,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.140]   there's a lot of disabilities
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.820]   that last a lot longer than six months, right?
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.340]   Some will last the rest of your life.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.180]   And so it's important to have long-term coverage also.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.700]   And then the last thing I wanna touch on
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.500]   with regard to disability insurance
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.220]   is the definition of disability that the policy uses.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.660]   Because some policies have what's called
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.780]   an own-occupation definition.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.500]   That means that if you become unable
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.620]   to perform your own occupation,
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.580]   then your account is disabled,
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.380]   and you can receive benefits.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.220]   And that's a good thing.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.260]   That's what you want to see in your policy.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.340]   Not as good is an any-occupation definition.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.420]   What that means is that in order to qualify for benefits,
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.620]   you have to be unable to perform any occupation.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.660]   That's a much stricter definition,
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.340]   so it's much harder to qualify for benefits
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.580]   with that sort of policy.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.940]   And moving on, we have life insurance.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.540]   Of course, we know that we need life insurance
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.500]   if there's anyone dependent on us.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.060]   And do we have sufficient life insurance?
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.420]   And this is another case where people will sometimes know
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.940]   that they've got coverage through their employer
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.260]   and think, "Great, I've got life insurance.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.700]   "I'm good to go."
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.860]   And they don't realize it's just not enough coverage.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.980]   Because the most common example that I see
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.900]   is that if you have coverage through your employer,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.820]   the death benefit will be one times your annual salary.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.580]   And if you imagine your spouse dying unexpectedly tomorrow
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.300]   and you receive one times their annual salary,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.940]   that's not nearly enough to replace all of the income
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.180]   from them that you have been counting on
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.660]   between now and retirement.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.220]   So most people just need a lot more coverage than that.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.500]   And then one last point about life insurance
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.980]   is that in some couples, one partner earns most
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.700]   or all of the income.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.300]   And in that case, it can still be important
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.500]   to have life insurance on the other partner.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.860]   And the most common example of that
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.100]   is the situation where spouse A has the job
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.220]   and earns the income.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.100]   Spouse B provides the childcare.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.620]   And if you imagine that spouse B dies,
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.260]   the household's income isn't about to fall,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.980]   but their expenses are going way up
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.180]   'cause the surviving spouse now has to pay
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.900]   for full-time childcare, which costs a lot.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.300]   And so even though the one partner isn't earning an income,
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.420]   they're still providing economic benefit
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   to the family, essentially, and so we need that reflected
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.980]   in the life insurance coverage.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.420]   And then moving on, still in insurance,
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.380]   we have all the liability policies.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.780]   So homeowners, renters, and auto policies.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.580]   And we just wanna check every once in a while
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.820]   the coverage limits because sometimes the decision
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   that made sense several years ago
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.020]   when you purchased this policy might not make sense anymore.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.060]   Something I see all the time is that people earlier
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.300]   in their careers, when they're more strapped for cash,
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.420]   they pick low coverage limits
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.300]   'cause that's what makes the policy affordable.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.140]   But now if you can afford better coverage,
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.820]   'cause you've gotten some raises as your career's progressed,
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.700]   it makes sense to buy better coverage most of the time.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.700]   And then one more thing to check on is
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.820]   whether we have an umbrella liability policy.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.800]   What that is, 'cause a lot of people don't,
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.820]   haven't even encountered that before,
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.220]   basically it's a policy that picks up
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.900]   where your other liability policies leave off.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.180]   So if you get in a car crash and you're at fault
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.940]   and you get sued, your auto policy will pay up
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.180]   to the liability limit, and then if you have
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.880]   an umbrella policy, it picks up after that, basically.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.740]   And then the last question that we wanna go over
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.580]   when we're doing these insurance discussions
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.020]   is every year during open enrollment season,
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.580]   we want to just take a few minutes at least
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.780]   to look at the different health insurance options.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.460]   Because the decision that you made last year,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.300]   it might make sense to switch
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.780]   to a different plan this year.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.540]   And the most critical question there is
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.420]   what we expect our healthcare costs to look like this year.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.900]   And to an extent, we don't know,
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.500]   but sometimes you do know, if for instance,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.500]   you know you're gonna need a particular procedure this year
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.340]   and it's a costly one, it can make sense
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.140]   to pick the plan with a higher premium
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.300]   and the lower deductible and a lower out-of-pocket maximum
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.540]   might yield savings for the year.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.400]   So that's it for insurance.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.020]   Now, the rest of the topics are somewhat faster.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.980]   And investment planning is actually the fastest one.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.060]   There's only a few boxes that we need to check off here,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.020]   despite the fact that we talk about it indefinitely.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.620]   And the first question is,
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.860]   is the portfolio reasonably diversified?
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.460]   And all I mean here is that Tesla stock example.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.900]   So if there's individual stocks in the portfolio,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.220]   how much is allocated to the biggest one?
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.580]   And in my opinion, most people shouldn't own
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.740]   individual stocks at all in most cases.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.700]   But if you do, we basically just want to avoid a case
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.180]   where if one particular company blows up,
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.180]   then our portfolio would blow up along with it.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.860]   We don't want that to even be a possibility.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.900]   And then with regard to the asset allocation,
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.740]   so that's just how much is in stocks
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.220]   as opposed to how much is in fixed income,
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.460]   why did we pick that?
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.700]   What evidence do we have to show
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.220]   that that's a good fit for us?
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.660]   And expense ratios.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.980]   This is another one that Bogleheads will talk about forever.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.100]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.180]   Basically, all it is is that funds that charge less
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.180]   to the investors typically provide better returns.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.380]   So that's a pretty easy way to improve
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.180]   the expected returns from your portfolios,
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.380]   just switch from expensive funds to inexpensive funds.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.580]   And lastly, this is my favorite one.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.780]   Could the portfolio be simplified?
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.900]   Because when I see people come in as clients,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.980]   the situation a lot of times is that
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.820]   their portfolio is really just a collection of stuff
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.940]   that they've accumulated over 20, 30, 40 years of investing.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.100]   And so they've got the current 401(k)
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.220]   and then maybe a 401(k) from the previous employer
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.780]   and maybe another one from the previous, previous employer
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.900]   and an IRA here and an IRA there.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.580]   And it's the same thing with the other spouse.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.140]   And so there's a million different accounts.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.540]   And in every account, you'll see eight to 12 mutual funds,
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.640]   maybe a couple individual stocks, maybe a bond or a CD.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.260]   And if that's what the portfolio looks like,
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.380]   there's no way without some sort of assistance from software
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.780]   to have any idea what's actually going on
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.680]   at the overall household level.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.020]   And that's what we care about.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.640]   We care about the overall household level
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.780]   because our goals exist at the household level.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.340]   And so simplifying by combining accounts
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.900]   is usually a good idea.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.500]   And reducing the number of holdings
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.680]   is also usually a good idea.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.260]   And there's great studies from Morningstar,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.780]   it's called the Mind the Gap Study,
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.500]   comes out every couple of years.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.260]   And it actually shows that investors do better
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.420]   with simpler funds.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.620]   They make better decisions in terms of when they buy them.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.460]   So target date funds, balance funds, life strategy funds,
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.560]   things like that.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.960]   Investors do a better job with them
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.740]   because they just put money into them and leave it alone.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.540]   Whereas when investors have portfolios
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.780]   that are sliced and diced into a zillion different funds,
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.900]   it's really tempting to,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.500]   this one hasn't been doing as well lately,
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.140]   so let's get rid of it, let's buy that other one.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.180]   And most of the time when people make decisions like that,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.980]   their timing is terrible.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.780]   So simplifying is usually advantageous if you can do it.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.800]   Moving on, we've got retirement planning.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.160]   And here the question, the first one is simply,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.060]   what's our plan for when we plan to retire?
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.960]   And this is for the most part just an excuse
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.540]   to revisit the question that we addressed in cash flow,
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.540]   which is, are we on track?
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.080]   Because that's something that we wanna be checking on
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.440]   at least pretty regularly.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.680]   And then another topic that you don't really have
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.820]   to worry about until you're getting close to age 62
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.240]   is social security.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.380]   And the question there is simply,
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.360]   when should we be filing for benefits?
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.380]   Because you can start as early as 62,
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.100]   or age 60 if you're a surviving spouse.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.960]   But the longer you wait, the larger your benefit is,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.260]   and so it's a trade-off of higher monthly income
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.600]   versus giving up income in the meantime.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.920]   And so that's something you'll want to spend
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.280]   a little bit of time researching.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.260]   And I gave a talk last year at this conference
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.740]   that dug into that, so you can look at that,
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.100]   it's on YouTube, it's free.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.400]   And do we know what we plan to retire to?
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   This one's not financial at all,
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.160]   but it is the most important question
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.080]   on this slide by a mile.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.560]   Because we're retiring from these jobs,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.600]   but what are we retiring to?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.720]   Because there's a good number of papers
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   that I've found interesting, this is not my field at all,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.760]   but in the field of psychology,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.400]   showing that two of the things,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.560]   these are not the only two things,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.040]   but two of the things that people need to be happy,
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.640]   actually, sorry, happy is not necessarily
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.560]   the word that gets used.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.080]   It's often something like long-term contentedness,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.560]   life satisfaction, rather than just a fleeting feeling
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.440]   of happiness, but two of the things.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.500]   Number one is close personal relationships.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.020]   That's a critical thing in order
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.280]   to be satisfied with our lives.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.680]   And another thing is that you're doing something
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.640]   with your time that gives you a feeling
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.140]   of competency or mastery or identity.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.940]   And for so many people, their job satisfies
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.040]   both of those requirements, right?
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.360]   We've got friendships with people at work.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.800]   Our job, we're good at it, and so it gives us
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.560]   some personal satisfaction in that sense.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.760]   So we're doing something with our time
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   that we find meaningful or fulfilling.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.840]   And then when you retire, that goes away.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.660]   And so it's important to have a specific
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.040]   and explicit plan for these are the steps
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.360]   we're going to take to maintain our friendships
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.880]   and build new friendships.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.240]   And this is what we're going to do
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.600]   with our new available time.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   Because if you just fill up all that time with Netflix,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.320]   that's the recipe for depression,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.480]   and so you need something better than that.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.560]   Now, estate and charitable planning,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.400]   of course you might divide these
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.640]   into two separate monthly topics if you want to,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.440]   whatever works for you.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.560]   Estate planning, we want to know
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.080]   if we've checked the beneficiaries recently
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.680]   on our retirement accounts and insurance policies, right?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.400]   So when you open an IRA or any similar account,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.720]   you have to fill out that form that says
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.040]   this is the primary beneficiary,
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   and that's who gets the money when I die,
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.120]   and this is the secondary beneficiary,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.020]   and that's who gets the money when I die
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.680]   if the primary beneficiary has also died.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.960]   And the most common example if you're in a partnership
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.040]   is that you name the other person as the primary beneficiary,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.880]   and if you have kids,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   typically the kids are the secondary beneficiaries.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.520]   That's kind of the default assumption most of the time.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   But what happens sometimes is you've got mom and dad,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.960]   they've got child A, child B,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.120]   and then they have child C.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.640]   And when you have a new kid,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.080]   maybe the first thing on your mind
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.200]   isn't signing into Vanguard or Fidelity or whatever
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   and updating these forms, and so maybe you just forget.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.080]   And then if the tragedy happens
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.880]   and mom and dad die in a car crash,
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.200]   and you've got child A gets half,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.240]   child B gets half, child C, oops.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.560]   And that's not good.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.440]   And so it's important to update these things
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.280]   every once in a while.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.680]   Similarly, something that you see more often
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.960]   than you might expect is the ex-spouse
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.680]   or the ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.000]   is the beneficiary on one of these accounts,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.840]   and not because we're still close.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.640]   It's just forgot to update it.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.040]   And that's not what you wanna see either.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.560]   And then the other big thing here
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.720]   is our critical estate planning documents.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   So do we have a will?
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.680]   Do we have durable power of attorney for finances
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   and healthcare power of attorney?
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.360]   And those last two documents are just the things
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.840]   that provide somebody else with the legal ability
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.480]   to make decisions on our behalf if we become incapacitated,
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.520]   so we can't make decisions for ourselves.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.640]   And then just like with the beneficiary designations,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.800]   when's the last time we updated these?
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.200]   If you just had child C, that's time to update the will.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.280]   Or if your sister is who you named
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.440]   as your power of attorney several years ago,
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.240]   and you had a falling out and you don't speak anymore,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   or maybe she's no longer living,
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.640]   it's time to update these things.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.200]   And then just like with the insurance policies,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.000]   we want to know where these are.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.240]   If they're physical documents, what drawer are they in?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.840]   Are they in a safe deposit box?
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.920]   Where are they?
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   Or if they're PDFs, what folder on whose computer
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.680]   or a shared Dropbox drive?
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.360]   Or specifically and exactly where are these?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.680]   And again, we want to know this answer
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.960]   without having to think about it.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.520]   Because if you take a minute to imagine
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.600]   the moment in your life where you need
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.640]   to find your spouse's will, that's potentially
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.080]   the single hardest day of your life
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   or the hardest week of your life.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.280]   And you don't want it to be made harder by the fact
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.600]   that you just don't know where the damn thing is.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.880]   And so you want to know where all these documents are.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   And moving on to the charitable planning side of things.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.720]   First question, would there be a more tax-efficient way
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.840]   to do the donating that we're doing?
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.840]   Because if there is, then we can do more donating
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   at the same net cost to us.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.680]   And that's, you know, why not?
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.520]   And so there's a few things to consider there.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.320]   Number one is what we call deduction bunching.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.080]   This is a strategy where, let's say,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.760]   you normally donate to seven different charities every year.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.960]   What if instead you made no donations
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.040]   for four years in a row?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.160]   And then in year five, you made five times the annual donation?
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.460]   And the idea here is that then in year five,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.640]   you get a really big deduction for this big donation
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.720]   that you made.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.160]   And in years one through four, you
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.620]   use the standard deduction.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.240]   And it's not always going to work out.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.080]   You have to do the math for your own family.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.840]   But in a lot of cases, that results in net savings
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.120]   over the period.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.800]   And then another option is donating appreciated shares.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.440]   So there's three requirements here.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.600]   Requirement number one is that this is an investment
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.160]   that you bought, and it has gone up in value.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.480]   Requirement number two is that this
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.180]   is something you own in a taxable account,
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.500]   so it's not an IRA.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.580]   And requirement number three is that you
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.200]   have owned this investment for longer than one year.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   And if all three of those requirements are met,
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.220]   and you donate this investment to a charity,
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.140]   then you get a deduction for the market value
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.180]   rather than just the amount that you paid for it.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.460]   And you don't have to pay tax on all of that appreciation.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.460]   And the reason that that's so good
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.780]   is that just compare that to the alternative
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.460]   where you sell this investment, and you
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.060]   pay tax on all of that appreciation,
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.020]   and then you write a check to the charity with what's left.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   You gave up the same shares, and you just
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.420]   didn't get to donate as much.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.260]   So donating appreciated shares can be a great approach.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.060]   And then qualified charitable distributions.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.020]   This also has three requirements.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.860]   Requirement number one, you have to be at least 70 and 1/2.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.800]   Requirement number two, it's money
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.180]   that's coming out of a traditional IRA.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.180]   And it has to be specifically a traditional IRA.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.340]   It can't be a 401(k) or a Roth IRA.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.900]   It has to be a traditional IRA.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.660]   Requirement three is that it goes directly
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.980]   from the traditional IRA to a charity.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.040]   When that happens, it counts as a QCD.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.340]   What that means is two things.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.180]   Number one is that it's not taxable to you,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.240]   whereas most of the time when you take money out
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.700]   of a traditional IRA, it is taxable.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.300]   So this is some tax savings.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.740]   And the second thing that it means
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.760]   is that it counts towards your required minimum distribution
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.500]   for the year.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.160]   So if you're of an age where you have to take RMDs,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.460]   qualified charitable distributions
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.740]   are a great way to satisfy that requirement
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.540]   without incurring any taxes and also do the charitable giving
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.180]   that you want to do anyway.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.460]   Moving on to our second to last topic is education planning.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.620]   First question here, how much are we
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   looking at in terms of price tag?
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.620]   And if we looked at the different options, so four
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.860]   years of private university versus four years of state
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.660]   university versus community college for a couple of years
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.620]   and then a couple of years of state university,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.860]   what are the actual price tags?
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.780]   Because until you have that information,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.620]   you can't really make an informed decision.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.900]   And then you want to go to at least one college night
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   or financial aid night at your child's school.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.700]   Those are generally very informative events
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.900]   where they put you in touch with local resources,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.360]   walk you through the FAFSA process,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.740]   and there's a lot going on there.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.660]   So it's valuable.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.460]   And a refunding of 529 plan.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.780]   That's just a tax advantage way to save for college.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.060]   And one caveat I always add there
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.140]   is that most families don't have enough income
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.000]   to fully fund the retirement savings goal
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.360]   and completely fund the college goal
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.960]   without taking on any student loans.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.200]   And when that's the case, retirement saving
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.880]   has to be the priority.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.120]   Because even though the college costs are coming sooner,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   and it is a big price tag, and you love your kids,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.440]   there's a critical difference here,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.280]   which is that for college costs, there might be scholarships.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.760]   There might be financial aid.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.840]   There is no retirement scholarship.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.120]   There's no federally subsidized retirement loans
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.480]   that you can just get because you asked for them.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.160]   And so if you only do one or the other,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.480]   you want to prioritize saving for retirement.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.320]   We also want to see, does our kids' school
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.000]   offer any AP courses?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.720]   Those are just courses you take in high school
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.280]   that offer college credit.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.640]   And the reason that that is so valuable
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.120]   is that tuition in many cases is based
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.400]   on the number of credit hours.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.680]   It might be a certain dollar amount per semester
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.480]   if you're taking 12 or more.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.680]   And if you're taking nine or fewer credit hours,
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   it's a much lower dollar amount.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.360]   Or if you can even eliminate an entire semester,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.520]   that's an enormous amount of cost savings.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.640]   And have we researched scholarships,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.480]   including from sources other than just the university?
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.240]   And the way I often explain this is
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.080]   that we don't typically like to be lumped into groups.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.000]   But now is the time to lump yourself
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.920]   into as many groups as you can.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.800]   And what I mean by that is think about every way
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   that you could be classified.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.680]   So your ethnicity, your religion, where you live,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.280]   what you do for a living, what organizations you're a part of.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.480]   And then think about the same questions for your child,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.280]   because there might be scholarships for somebody
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.360]   in those groups.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.720]   So take some time to think about all of those things
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.800]   that you could be called, and then do some research online
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.640]   to see what might be available.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.960]   And then the last question, do we
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.160]   think our child would study for the PSAT
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.400]   if we encourage them to do that?
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.640]   And the reason I mention this test in particular
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.480]   is that it's the one that is the initial hurdle
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.360]   for national merit scholarships.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.240]   And those-- many universities offer
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.680]   super generous scholarships for national merit students.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   In many cases, full tuition.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.220]   And so if you think your child would study for this test,
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.680]   it's worth buying a book on Amazon
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.040]   and encouraging them to spend a couple of hours a week for maybe
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.280]   a couple of months.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.040]   And I know that to a busy high schooler,
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.600]   that's going to sound terrible.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.480]   It's going to sound like this enormous burden.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.520]   But we're talking about 16 to 20-something hours
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.200]   total over their life.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.520]   And the potential payoff is enormous.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.440]   So if you think your child would do that
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.320]   with some encouragement, it's worth
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.560]   giving them that encouragement.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.540]   And moving on to our last topic, we've got tax planning.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.440]   And there's way too many things that
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.360]   fall under this umbrella to cover all of them.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.960]   So just a few of the most common ones.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   For accumulators-- so again, that's anybody saving
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.040]   towards retirement.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.840]   Are we maxing out our retirement accounts?
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.040]   And have we looked recently at the Roth first tax
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.900]   deferred question?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.040]   Because in many cases, you might have
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.480]   made a decision several years ago
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.880]   that made sense at that time, but it doesn't make sense now.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.240]   So if you've signed up for your 401(k) six years ago,
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.640]   but since then your income has gone up, or it's gone down,
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.040]   or you've gotten married, or you've gotten divorced,
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.560]   or you've had kids, or your spouse's income has changed,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.080]   all of those things would change your tax situation.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.320]   And so the Roth first tax deferred decision
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.880]   that was right then should be re-evaluated.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.040]   And then for retirees, it's the same question,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.160]   but the other side of the coin.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   So here, instead of looking at which accounts
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.120]   we're contributing to, now we want
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.720]   to know which accounts should we be taking out of.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.560]   So if we need to spend a certain amount of money this year,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.380]   how much of it should come out of taxable?
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.040]   How much of it should come out of Roth?
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.560]   And how much of it should come out of tax deferred?
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.800]   And the talk I gave last year also discusses that in depth.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.840]   Wade was also talking about it yesterday.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.120]   And that is a topic where there's a fair bit going on,
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.220]   but the potential for tax savings is very significant.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.920]   So it's worth digging into a little bit
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.840]   once you're approaching retirement.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.640]   And is our portfolio tax efficient?
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.240]   And there's just two things that I want to mention here.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.120]   Number one is that we generally want the assets
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.160]   that grow the fastest in Roth accounts.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.720]   Or rather, we want to fill the Roth accounts
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.480]   with those assets, because A, Roth accounts,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.520]   if you meet the requirements,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.280]   you never have to pay tax on the growth.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.440]   And B, Roth accounts don't have RMDs,
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.640]   whereas tax deferred accounts do.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.700]   And so when you combine those two factors,
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.200]   if you could choose one type of account
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.080]   that you would want to grow the fastest,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.960]   you would want your Roth accounts to grow the fastest.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.920]   And so most of the time, you want to fill those with stocks.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.580]   That basically just means you want a total stock market fund
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.400]   or international fund or total world or something like that
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.000]   in your Roth accounts most of the time.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.080]   And then in our taxable accounts,
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.680]   we basically just want to avoid anything
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.760]   that is going to create a lot of taxable income
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.200]   and a lot of tax costs every year.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.960]   So a few things on that list are high-yield bonds,
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.240]   junk bonds, they pay a lot of interest.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   That means a lot of taxable income and a lot of taxes,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.760]   so we don't want them in a taxable account.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.560]   Mutual funds with high turnover,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.120]   because whenever a mutual fund sells something
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.680]   within the portfolio, if it sells it for a gain,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.120]   you have to pay tax on that gain.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.800]   So even though you didn't sell something,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.600]   the fund sold something, so you have to pay taxes.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.860]   And the more turnover there is,
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.160]   the more often you have to pay those taxes.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.000]   And then real estate and investment trusts, REITs,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.440]   those are just stocks in the real estate industry,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.820]   and they're a perfectly fine thing to own,
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.480]   but if you own them, you want them in a retirement account,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.120]   because in a taxable account,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   the problems are that number one,
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.320]   they pay more dividends than most stocks do,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.840]   so more taxable income, and those dividends are taxed
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   at a higher tax rate than most dividends,
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.540]   so we don't want REITs in taxable.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.740]   And then the last question under tax planning
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.360]   is Roth conversions.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.120]   Would those be useful either this year
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.640]   or in the near future?
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.240]   And a Roth conversion is really just
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.520]   when you move money from tax-deferred over to Roth,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.040]   so we're taking it out of a traditional IRA
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.800]   and moving it into a Roth IRA,
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.400]   and when you do that, you usually have to pay tax
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.680]   on that money, the money that you've converted.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.640]   And the idea is basically that we're taking advantage
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.400]   anytime that you have an unusually low tax rate.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.440]   So the most common example is you've retired,
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.600]   so your income has gone down
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.120]   because you're no longer working,
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.640]   and you haven't yet started receiving Social Security,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.560]   so you have a temporarily low level of income,
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.080]   which doesn't necessarily but usually means
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.380]   a temporarily low tax rate,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.640]   so the idea is we're gonna take advantage
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.240]   of that low tax rate, move some money over now,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.760]   pay tax at that low tax rate,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.700]   and then it's in Roth going forward.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.040]   And the other common examples, less common
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.460]   but still important to know about,
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.800]   are if you ever have an unpaid sabbatical,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   or if you ever get laid off for part of the year,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   so reasons why your income for that year
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.080]   would be unusually low, that's a good time
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.680]   to think about a Roth conversion for that year.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.080]   It doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea,
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.440]   but it's worth considering.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.280]   And so that is the entirety of the checklist,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.160]   and unfortunately, that's still not
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.380]   super-duper comprehensive.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.240]   There could be other things
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.760]   that are important to your family,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.800]   and so this is something that we're gonna have
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.760]   to adjust over time.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.120]   But fortunately, as you probably noticed,
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.940]   there's probably some things
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.360]   that aren't relevant to your family, right?
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.920]   Maybe your kids are already finished with college,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.120]   so we don't really need to worry
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.580]   about the education planning anymore.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.820]   And again, I think that for most families,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.880]   what's going to work a lot better
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.320]   than trying to just pound out this whole thing,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.000]   start to finish in one day,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.640]   is smaller, manageable chunks.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.760]   So going over this with your partner once a month.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.360]   This month, we talk about cash flow planning,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.440]   and we make sure that we have a big enough emergency fund.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.420]   We look at how much we're spending every month.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.080]   Next month, we go over insurance.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.160]   We make sure we have disability insurance.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.440]   We make sure that that includes long-term disability,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.120]   and we look at the definition of disability,
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.320]   own occupation versus any occupation.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.360]   The next month is investing,
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.440]   and you just, one month at a time.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.940]   And it does get easier over time,
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.460]   because you really only have to address
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.940]   the things that have changed since last time,
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.580]   for the most part.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.100]   And again, the goal here is so that
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.420]   both spouses can get involved.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.800]   So that if the one who is not
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.660]   the household's financial manager
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.660]   becomes the financial manager,
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.940]   they're better prepared to take on that task.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.300]   And number two, so that in the meantime,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.200]   that person can be providing some oversight.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.300]   Because I can tell you from experience
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.100]   that if spouse A is the one
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.720]   who is supposedly taking care of
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.600]   all of the financial planning topics,
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.000]   sometimes something gets left out.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.240]   They're doing their best,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.680]   they're making a very good effort,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.000]   they're researching all of these things,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.080]   but sometimes something gets left out.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.480]   And so having the other person
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.960]   check in on a regular basis with an actual checklist
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.280]   and say, are we taking care of this and this and this,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.880]   that can be extremely valuable.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.280]   So that's really all I had.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.640]   And I think we've, yeah.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.040]   Got some questions, okay.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.180]   Ooh, all right.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.420]   Question, is counseling the only option
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.260]   when the reluctant spouse refuses to engage on this topic?
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.420]   Woo-wee! (audience laughing)
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.260]   All right.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.980]   Getting serious.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.860]   I don't think so.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.780]   I think it's not necessarily a bad idea.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.740]   And so yesterday I did mention,
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.540]   in one of the sessions, you might not have been there,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.060]   but I did mention counseling.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.260]   And I don't, I'm not joking about that, by the way.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.340]   I mean this very seriously.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.140]   Most of us benefit from counseling
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.620]   at some point in our lives,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.660]   because most of us aren't gonna have perfect mental health
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.860]   from the day we're born until the day we die.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.540]   It's just like physical health care.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.980]   We need mental health care at some point.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.140]   It's valuable.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.960]   And so we joke about it also, 'cause it can be funny,
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.460]   and it maybe makes us uncomfortable,
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.680]   but I'm not joking, it's worth doing.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.540]   That said, it's not the only approach.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.280]   And I think that what I'm talking about here,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.820]   the oversight committee idea,
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.540]   to let you in on the secret,
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.960]   that can be a bit of a hook, right?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.180]   That's what we're trying to do.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.220]   Give this person a job, right?
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.860]   Something that shows them that they're valuable.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.580]   And it's not a trick.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.060]   It's not tricking them into thinking they're valuable.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.860]   They are, because I can tell you,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.100]   so I'm a CPA, I've been in this field
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.660]   since the day I graduated,
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.260]   and my wife is a software developer.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.060]   Before that, she was a food writer.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.780]   Before that, she was a court advocate
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.100]   for domestic violence victims,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.540]   and her degree is in criminal justice.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.600]   So nothing related to personal finance
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.420]   in the entirety of her education or career.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.260]   And when we go over these things,
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.140]   all the time, she's got valuable input,
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.540]   things that I didn't think of.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.980]   And I think the reason for that,
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.540]   and I see this, by the way, working with clients
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.780]   anytime I'm sitting with a couple,
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.540]   'cause most of the time there is the one spouse
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.860]   who's super-duper raring to go,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.660]   and the other one who doesn't say as much.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.860]   But when that spouse who doesn't say as much
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   does say something, every time it's critical.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.880]   And I think the reason is that those of us
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.580]   who spend all of this time thinking
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.180]   about the financial stuff,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.820]   that's what our head's filled up with.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.980]   And the other person has more space in their brain
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.200]   for all of the other things going on in life.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.980]   And all of the financial decisions that we make
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.340]   are not just financial.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.660]   They're part financial and partly about the other things
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.300]   that are going on in our life.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.660]   And so this comes up all the time.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.020]   You'll see, we're doing some retirement tax planning
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.700]   and talking about taxable income
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.640]   and all the things we can talk about.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.180]   And then the one who's less talkative,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.320]   the spouse who's less involved, will say,
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.660]   what if your dad ends up living with us?
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.520]   And just brings up a whole thing
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.260]   that hasn't even been considered,
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.980]   and boy, that's important.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.660]   We need to talk about that.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.300]   And that happens.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.980]   So we're not tricking them into thinking
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.700]   that they're valuable as the oversight committee.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.580]   They are.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.260]   If you haven't gotten their input yet, you're missing out.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.120]   So that's what I would encourage you to do,
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.220]   is try to empower them in that role,
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.460]   because it really is valuable.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.460]   Is there anyone who does not need umbrella insurance?
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.420]   How about if they don't own a house or car?
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.420]   That's a good question.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.620]   So if you don't own a house, you're probably a renter.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.300]   Hopefully, you have renter's insurance.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.900]   And you can still incur some liabilities in that way,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.060]   if someone comes over to your home and they get injured,
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.100]   they can sue you.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   And so renter's insurance can cover that,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.460]   and then umbrella could pick up from there.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.940]   But there are certainly households
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.340]   where it's less critical.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.700]   I will say about renter's insurance--
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.540]   or not renter's insurance, although also renter's
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.340]   insurance-- but umbrella insurance is not very expensive.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.460]   If you're looking at long-term care policies or health
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.580]   insurance, those are really expensive.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.820]   And so you might be expecting this huge price tag.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.820]   Umbrella policy is not that expensive.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.180]   So before saying I don't want that,
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.980]   at least go find out how much it would cost,
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.380]   because it might be less than you're thinking.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.100]   Any recommendations on personal software planning tools
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.580]   for DIYs?
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.540]   This is one I struggle with, because the software that I use
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.420]   is advisor software, and so it's expensive.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.460]   It's priced for advisors.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.220]   It wouldn't make-- I pay like $3,000 a year for one of them,
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.660]   and probably, I think, $1,500 a year for the other one.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.860]   And so if you're a DIYer, it wouldn't
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.580]   make sense to pay for that.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.260]   And because I'm happy with that software,
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.260]   I then don't spend a million hours test driving
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.660]   all of the other softwares.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.900]   I can tell you, though, what I hear good things about.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.780]   So this is second-hand information,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.000]   but I hear good things about New Retirement.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.980]   Steve, are you here?
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.580]   OK.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.060]   Well, Steve, he's a bogel head.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.500]   He's been here this weekend.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.460]   And he's the person-- there's a team of them,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.900]   but he's the owner of the company.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.620]   And he's involved in this community
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.900]   and listening to your feedback.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.700]   He cares about what you think, and they're constantly
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.860]   building out new things.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.780]   So I can't personally say I've used it,
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.540]   and oh, it did all these great things, and it was perfect,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.940]   but I hear good things about it.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.740]   And it is getting better over time,
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.680]   because they're actively working on it.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.140]   Another one that I hear good things about most of the time,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.860]   although I did hear somebody yesterday
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.140]   who wasn't thrilled with it, is Maxify Planner--
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.340]   M-A-X-I-- Maxify-- M-A-X-I-F-I Planner.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.660]   And that's from Lawrence Kotlikoff,
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.340]   who is a super knowledgeable social security expert, as well
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.700]   as just broadly retirement planning expert.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.020]   So that's another great piece of software.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:59.100]   Pralana Gold-- that's P-R-A-L-A-N-A--
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.340]   gold, as opposed to bronze or silver.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.820]   That's an Excel-based program.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.660]   And again, these are just--
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.940]   I hear good things about them.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.660]   I haven't tested them in any serious way.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.060]   So those are the three that I hear the most about.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   Wade yesterday mentioned one that I've actually
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.460]   never even heard of--
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.980]   Flexible Retirement Planner, something like that.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.580]   So that might not be the exact name,
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.940]   but I'd do a Google search.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.860]   I bet you can find it.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.380]   "How do you know how much life insurance you need?"
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.060]   Good question.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.020]   So question number one--
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.140]   is there anybody dependent on you for income?
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.260]   Because if there isn't--
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.820]   somebody who's early in their career, they have no kids,
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.140]   and they're not married or anything--
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.820]   zero is the answer, because nobody's
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.580]   going to be hung out to dry, so to speak,
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.460]   if you die unexpectedly.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:51.020]   Similarly, if you are already financially independent,
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.500]   unless you have a pension without a survivor benefit,
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.580]   then again, nobody's hung out to dry if you
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.380]   die unexpectedly or expectedly.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.140]   And so it depends on--
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.780]   basically, we want to look at the needs of other people
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.380]   that would go unmet if you died tomorrow.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.620]   That's the driving factor here.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.260]   And so how far are we from financial independence?
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.980]   Because if you're almost there, a smaller amount of life
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.640]   insurance is totally reasonable.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:25.100]   If you're 24, and you've got a brand new baby,
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.980]   that's going to be a lot of costs
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.100]   that need to be covered.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.140]   So life insurance depends on, basically,
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.180]   the needs that would go unmet if you were to die
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.380]   and didn't have life insurance.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.380]   What advice do you have for those who overfunded
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.300]   their 529 plans?
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:44.300]   Find somebody else who is planning on college education
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   is basically the answer.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.380]   And that's not a joke, because you overfunded it.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.780]   Probably what that means is that you have more in there
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.400]   than your kids needed.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.160]   There's a good chance there's going to be grandkids, or great
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.380]   nieces and nephews, or whoever.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.900]   Somebody else you love and care about
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.340]   who you wouldn't mind paying for their college costs.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:05.020]   Or actually, even yourself, if the idea of studying whatever
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.220]   sounds appealing, you can pay for yourself with a 529 plan.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:17.540]   529 plans can now be used to put money
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.100]   into a Roth IRA for a person who is
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.340]   a beneficiary of the plan.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.620]   A couple tricky things there is that there's a dollar limit.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.820]   And in order to qualify, the person
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.020]   needs to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:32.540]   anyway.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.060]   So basically, this can just count
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.300]   as the contribution for the year if they're allowed to do that.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.660]   So that's something to look into, certainly.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.620]   But if you're looking into it, really, really look into it
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.420]   to make sure that you don't overstep the rules, basically,
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.460]   is what I would say.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.700]   Estate planning.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.740]   How about joining the military out of high school
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.220]   or joining ROTC in college?
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.140]   Oh, education planning.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.260]   Sorry, not estate planning.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.620]   I was trying to figure out the-- that sounds morbid.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.300]   OK.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.300]   Woo!
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.380]   Oh, gosh.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.060]   All right, education planning.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.060]   You know, that, honestly, is something--
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.140]   I don't have a lot to say.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.900]   I don't have personal experience with either of those things.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.500]   So Anne Garcia, maybe--
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.860]   she's the college savings expert.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.780]   I don't know if she's in the room right now.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.980]   But I would bet that she would have a lot better information
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.900]   than I would have on those topics.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.300]   And that's the last question.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.380]   I think we're out of time.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:24.980]   So thank you.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.340]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.700]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:40.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
