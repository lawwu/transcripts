[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.320]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in the fourth chapter, reading verses 22, 23, and 24, that
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.280]   he put off concerning the former conversation, "The old men, which is corrupt according to
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.840]   the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind." And that he put on the
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:43.440]   new men, "Which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." We come back to a consideration
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.800]   of this great exhortation, and I would remind you as we do so, of certain things which are
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.480]   important from the standpoint of structure. The apostle here, you remember, is now applying
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.800]   the truth that he has been laying down in the first half of this great epistle. He has
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.360]   not been teaching them all this doctrine merely for the sake of doing so. He was not a professor
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.640]   of theology, dealing with these matters in an abstract and a theoretical way. He is a
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.240]   pastor, an evangelist, a preacher, and he is concerned about the life of these people,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   that they should grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. So, having put the
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.280]   doctrine before them, he now says, "You have got to apply this." And his way of putting
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.560]   it is that they must no longer go on living as they formerly did, and as the other Gentiles
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.040]   still do. And he gives them reasons for that. The thing he says is unthinkable, owing to
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.680]   the character of that life, and so on. But here now he comes to a very positive exhortation.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.760]   He says, "If you have really learned Christ at all, if you truly have heard him as the
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.040]   truth is in Jesus and have been taught in him, well then," he says, "you have been
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:18.120]   taught this, that you must put off that old man and put on the new man."
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.520]   Now here it is then, and I would remind you again that the exhortation has these two sides
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.320]   to it, the negative, the put off, and the positive, put on, connected by this link which
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:41.040]   is in the twenty-third verse, which is being renewed, going on being renewed in the spirit
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.160]   of your mind. Now, I was at pains to indicate this, that these two sides must always be
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.560]   taken together. You don't just put off the old man and leave it at that. Neither can
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.280]   you just put on the new man. It's impossible. You can't put on the new man without putting
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.920]   off the old man. So that the two sides should always be taken together. And yet it is important,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.840]   obviously, that they must be considered separately, because we have actually to put off the old
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.160]   man. And unless we have done that, I say, we can't go on to put on the new man.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.240]   And so we are looking still at the negative, the putting off of the old man. We've taken
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.160]   the term in general "put off." We have reminded ourselves that it's like taking
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.920]   off a garment and throwing it aside. We've also tried to consider the meaning of the
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.840]   term "the old man," that we may know exactly what we are doing there. And we've
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.680]   also—and this was our theme the last time we were considering this, just before Easter—we've
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.360]   also considered some reasons as to why we should do this. And the apostle makes them
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.280]   quite plain. We are to put off that old man, he says, because he is corrupt according to
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.440]   the lusts of deceit. And we considered that the last time, the terrible, horrible nature
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.720]   of that old life, corrupt and corrupting, leading to destruction. It's a life of deceit
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.360]   and of sham and pretense. There's nothing to be said for it, according to the lusts
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   of deceit. Very well, there are our reasons for doing
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.960]   this. That's why we should put off the old man. But now the apostle, as I've been
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.680]   indicating, was concerned here to be very practical. This is the practical section of
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.920]   this epistle, and we'll do violence to his teaching, unless we also become practical.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.360]   So I want to call your attention this morning to the way in which we put off the old man.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   Or if you like, how to put off the old man. We've seen why we are to put him off. Well
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.160]   now, then, the next step is, how do we put him off? And this is, I say, a very important
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.280]   and a very vital matter for us. It's not enough just to say, "Put off the old man,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   put on the new." No, no, this is something that's got to be done in practice and in
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.360]   detail. And we must know exactly how to do it.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.960]   Now, it may be that it is at this point that modern evangelicalism shows its greatest weakness
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.360]   of all. This is an aspect of the Christian life that has been sadly and sorry neglected
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.120]   in a way, for the reason that I'm going to show you. Now, we've often expressed
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.840]   adverse criticisms of Roman Catholicism, and we still do so. But we've got to grant them
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   that in this particular matter, they have a great deal to teach us. The culture of the
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.480]   spiritual and the devotional life. But we needn't go to them. It was the peculiar
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.920]   teaching of the great Puritans of the seventeenth century. This is the thing they excelled at,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.960]   this kind of pastoral theology, this teaching in detail as to how this fight of faith is
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.040]   to be fought. But all that, I say, has tended to be neglected
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.600]   by us, and to that extent we are guilty of doing violence to the Scripture. This is something,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.520]   then, I say, that's got to be taken in detail. Very well, what's the teaching? Well,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:50.000]   here is the first principle. This is something that you and I have to do. It is not something
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.680]   that is done for us. You notice that it is a command, "Put off the old men." It's
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:08.080]   an exhortation. It is, I say, a definite command that he gives to us. Now, let me expound what
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   I mean by that, by putting it again negatively. Putting off the old men is not something that
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.800]   is to be prayed about. Now, that sounds most unspiritual, doesn't it? Fancy a preacher
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.440]   in a Christian pulpit telling people that they're not to pray about this. But it is
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.240]   very essential that we should say that, because there is a tendency on the part of so many
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.320]   people, whatever the problem is, they say glibly and immediately, "Pray about it.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.800]   Take it to the Lord in prayer." Quite simple, they say. You've got nothing to do but pray.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.520]   Nothing worrying, pray about it. No, no, it's just bull. You don't pray about this, you
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:08:00.840]   put off the old men. Get on with it. Now, there is something almost violent about this,
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.280]   and I think it needs violence, because there is a great deal of sickly sentimentality and
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.880]   a false piety concerning this matter. And it leads to people living the kind of spiritual
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:21.320]   life ever in the doldrums. Of course we need to pray about everything. Our whole life should
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.800]   be a life of prayer. We should pray without ceasing. What I'm saying is that you don't
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.480]   solve this problem by just praying about it. The apostle doesn't hear, tell these people,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.040]   "Now look here, with regard to this problem, I want you to pray about this." No, no, he
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.160]   says, "Look here, for the reasons I've given you, put off that old man. You don't pray
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.360]   about this, I'm telling you to do it. Get on with it and do it."
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.560]   Now, people say, "Oh yes, but what about my lack of strength and of power?" Well, there's
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:07.200]   an answer for that. As a regenerate creature, as a newborn being, you have the power. The
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.520]   New Testament never commends us to do a thing without giving us the power to do it. And
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.240]   therefore there is no excuse at this point. Now this is a very subtle matter, therefore
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:24.880]   let me put it like this. I suggest that very often people, by praying about a matter like
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:33.360]   this, far from solving their problem, are simply increasing it. Because they pray in
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.160]   a spirit of fear. They say, "Oh, I'm so weak, I can do nothing," and they pray to
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.360]   be delivered from this thing instead of putting it off. And the whole time they're, in a
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:51.560]   sense, suggesting it to themselves. The way to solve this problem is not, I say, to pray,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:59.600]   it is to think, and to apply the teaching and the doctrine, to put off the old man.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   I can't quite recall whether I related an incident to you of a lady who once came to
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.360]   speak to me many years ago about a problem which had been crippling her life for, I think,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:20.440]   twenty-two years. It may sound to you a trivial thing, but it was spoiling her life. She had
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:29.120]   a phobia, a terror, a horror of thunderstorms. She once had been in a terrible thunderstorm
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.480]   and thought she was going to be killed. And that had fixed on her mind, and it had come
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.840]   to this in the end, that if she were walking to her place of worship on a Sunday morning
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.160]   and happened to see a black cloud, she'd begin to say, "Ah, there's a thunderstorm
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.080]   coming," and instead of going to church she'd go home because of her fear. And it
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.320]   had taken many forms. It had prevented her doing many things she'd wanted to do. It
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.720]   had created difficulties in the family and so on. You can see the kind of problem that
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.520]   had arisen. Well, this lady came to talk to me purely as the result of something I said
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.280]   as an aside in a sermon she happened to be listening to. And she stated all this to me.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.880]   "Well, now," I said, "what have you been doing about it?" "Well," she said,
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.320]   "I've done everything I can." She talked to all sorts of people. I said, "I suppose
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.760]   you've prayed about it." She said, "I pray about nothing else. I'm always praying
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.240]   about it." I said, "Well, that is probably why the problem has persisted." I said,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:36.040]   "What you need is not to pray but to think." And then I pointed out to her simply what
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:43.480]   a bad testimony this was in a Christian person such as she was. Had she ever thought of that?
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.520]   Had she ever asked herself the question, "Why should I be more afraid of a thunderstorm
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.840]   than anybody else? If all those other people can go on and go into the place of worship,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.200]   why shouldn't I?" Why is this so peculiar? She'd never thought of all this. But she
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.720]   was praying to be delivered from this fear of thunderstorms. And she'd been praying
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.200]   sincerely and honestly and with great intensity for the twenty-two years. But the thing was
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.320]   there and it was increasing. There are points, I say, in the name of God and in the name
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:21.520]   of Scripture about which you don't need to pray but you do need to think and to apply
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:29.120]   the doctrine. You put off the old men. You needn't pray for guidance about this. Having
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.600]   realized his character, put him off. This isn't a matter of praying. This is a matter
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.880]   of doing. And so we see that the devil, in his subtlety and as an angel of light, can
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.640]   sometimes encourage us to pray in a blind and unintelligent manner because he knows
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.400]   that as long as we're doing that we won't think and we won't face the scriptural teaching
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.720]   and apply it to ourselves and to this particular problem. Very well then, I say, it is not
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.340]   a matter to be prayed about. It's a matter to be done. Or let me put it in another negative.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.840]   This is not an experience which you receive or which happens to you. You are familiar
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:18.520]   with a teaching that says to you, whatever problem you've got in your spiritual life,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:24.200]   it's quite simple, they say. You've got nothing to do but take it to the Lord and leave it
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:32.320]   with him. He'll deliver you. Let go, let God. Quite simple, they say. You've simply got
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:39.400]   to take it to him and then you'll have this wonderful experience of deliverance. Now that
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:46.240]   teaching has been propagated, as you know, for a number of years now. And there are people
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.960]   who've been trying to do this, trying to let go and to let God. They've been told
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.800]   that if only they do this they'll be delivered entirely from this particular matter. But
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.400]   they haven't been delivered. They may have had a temporary deliverance while they were
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:07.080]   in the meetings but it comes back again. And they've gone on trying to let go, trusting
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.680]   this thing will happen. No, says the apostle, that isn't what's needed. You must put
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:22.040]   off the old man yourself. You don't ask God to take this from you. You put him off.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:32.680]   Now surely we should recognize that such teaching is quite unscriptural. If that teaching were
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.960]   true, well then this whole section of this epistle to the Ephesians, from the 17th verse
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.840]   of this chapter to the end of the epistle, should never have been written at all. The
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.560]   apostle shouldn't have written these words. And he shouldn't have gone on to say, "Wherefore
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:54.360]   put away lying, speak truth to every man to his neighbor, be ye angry and sin not, neither
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   give place to the devil, let him that stole steal no more." He wouldn't have said all
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.040]   that. It would have been wrong for him to say it. He'd have said, "Look here, if
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.800]   any of you are tempted by this matter of stealing, pray about it. Let go and ask the Lord to
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.280]   deliver you from it." But he doesn't say that. He says, "Look here, you who have
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.560]   been given to stealing, stop doing it. Steal no more. Put off the old man."
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:24.880]   Thus, you see, a teaching which may sound very spiritual can be utterly unscriptural.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.000]   It not only bypasses the Scripture, it denies the Scripture. "Ah, but," they say, "surely
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.760]   you received your sanctification as you received your justification. You received your justification
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.240]   by faith, you took it by faith, and you must do the same here." But that's where the
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.120]   fallacy comes in. In the matter of justification, it is entirely by faith. Why? Well, because
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:54.920]   one has no spiritual life, one has no ability at all. That is entirely by faith. But not
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:02.880]   so this. But say someone hasn't, Paul said in chapter 2, "We are his workmanship, created
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   in Christ Jesus unto good works." Of course, that's justification, that's regeneration.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.240]   We are entirely his work there. But remember that the same Paul who writes, "We are his
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   workmanship," also says to those who have been made, "Work out your own salvation with
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.120]   fear and trembling." That's it. Put away, put off, put on. We are his workmanship. Of
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.240]   course, we can't do anything until he's made us anew. But once he's made us anew, well,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.360]   then we are capable of working. So he says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:47.920]   trembling." Justification is by faith only. Sanctification is not by faith only. The whole
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.400]   of the Christian life is a life of faith. But in sanctification, we have to work, and
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.560]   to work out, and we have to put off, and we have to put on, and so on, and all these details
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.200]   which he gives us here.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:10.520]   Very well, then, this is obviously a very vital matter. We start by realizing that this
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:18.240]   is something that we have to do ourselves. It isn't done for us. We don't just wake passively
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.720]   or relax and have the experience of it all being taken out of us. Not a bit of it. Put
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:36.440]   off. Stop doing certain things, he says. You and I have literally to do this ourselves.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.920]   And oh, I say again what a tragedy it is that men and women should have thought that it
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:52.120]   was to be highly spiritual to deny this plain command, exhortation, and teaching of the
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   Scripture. That other teaching, as I have often pointed out, rarely means that the second
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:04.160]   half of every New Testament epistle should never have been written at all. All the apostles
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.680]   should have said, either at the beginning of chapter 4 or in verse 17, is just this.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.400]   Very well, now, then, in the light of this doctrine, all you have got to do is to let
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:21.720]   go, to abide in Christ, and all will be well with you. You will be delivered from all your
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.760]   problems. It's quite simple. It's just like lifting up the blinds and letting the sun
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.080]   come in, there's no more to be done. That's all you need have said, and all the other
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   right of us. But you notice that they give about half of their letters to detailed, practical
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.440]   instructions? They tell people what not to do, they tell them what to do. Clearly, these
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:52.160]   two teachings are quite incompatible. But the teaching of the Scripture is, put off.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:58.720]   It is something that you and I have to do ourselves. And as I have reminded you, it
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.240]   is no use saying we haven't the strength you have. If you are the Christian, it is
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.760]   there. God never commends the man to do a thing without enabling him to do it. If you
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.240]   and I are born again, the Spirit of God and of Christ is in us. The Holy Spirit is in
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.680]   us. The power is there. And we have to realize that. And in the strength of that might and
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.760]   power, we act. We do this thing. Now then, how do we do it? That's the second
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:34.960]   matter, the practical. There's the principle, now then the practical application. And here
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:43.160]   are some of the things which are essential, and they're all simple and practical. The
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:51.520]   first is we have to remind ourselves of who we are and what we are. You've always got
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.760]   to start with that. The Apostle indeed has been telling us to do that. He says, "Put
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.320]   off this old man because of his character, and put on this new man which, after God,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:10.440]   is created in righteousness and true holiness." We are no longer what we were. That's his
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.640]   argument. Well, now then, the first thing we have to do is to tell ourselves that. The
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:23.440]   whole art of Christian living is to know how to talk to yourself. If you don't preach
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:32.040]   to yourself, you're not a Christian. A Christian is a preacher. He preaches to himself. And
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.880]   this is the essence of Christian living. You start your day by telling yourself, "Now
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.960]   then, I am the new man. I'm no longer the old man. My old man has been crucified with
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:51.720]   Christ. My old man is dead, finished with him. He's non-existent. I am no longer what
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:00.800]   I was. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creation. Old things have
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:08.320]   passed away. Behold, all things have become new." You start the morning by saying that
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.680]   to yourself. Now, it won't be said to you. It won't happen automatically to you. The
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.560]   devil will speak to you the moment you wake up, and he'll say a thousand and one things
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.920]   to you to try and depress you before you've started. Therefore, you and I have to make
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.320]   a resolution. We're going to get up and we're going to say, "Our waking thought shall be,
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:35.280]   'I am a new man in Christ.'" That's the way to do it. It literally has to be done in detail
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.800]   in this way.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:44.120]   Now, I think you see at once that it's not surprising why we fail so much. We don't start
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:51.280]   like that, do we? "Here are these thoughts again, and here's the problem another eighteen
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.360]   hours or so before me. What can I do?" And we're already defeated. "No, no," says Paul,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.000]   "get up, put off the old men." That's the way you used to think. You were under all this.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.040]   It was on top of you. But that's no longer the case. You're on top now. Christ has come
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   into you and has delivered you. Therefore, so you don't hurry out of your bed and get
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.920]   on your knees and say, "Oh Lord, deliver me, keep me this." No, no, before you pray, you
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.000]   remind yourself of who you are. Because if you pray in that depressed way, you're not
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.420]   really praying in the Spirit at all. It's a prayer of unbelief, not of belief.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.480]   So we can't really pray until we are clear in our doctrine. We remind ourselves who we
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:36.360]   are before we go to God. There's the first thing. Well, then the second follows obviously,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   doesn't it? You remind yourself again of the nature and the character of that old life.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.240]   It's depicted here in these terrifying verses, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen. It gives
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.040]   his little summary again in verse twenty-two. You see how concerned the apostle is that
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.000]   we should do this in detail. He won't let us escape it, you see. He keeps on reminding
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.880]   us of the character of the life. He says, "Hold that before you." And this, I sometimes
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:16.600]   think is the whole art of triumphing in the Christian life. I suppose I have to say this
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:23.320]   more frequently than anything else in my pastoral work. People come about particular problems,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.400]   and they've been praying to be delivered and so on. I say, "Now wait a minute. Have
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.480]   you ever really looked this thing in the face? You're frightened of it. You're running
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   away from it. You're cowering. Your whole attitude is wrong." I say, "Wait a moment.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.840]   Examine this thing. Put it up in front of you. Analyze it and dissect it. See it for
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:51.280]   what it is. That's half the battle." And then, says Paul, you'll see that the whole
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.960]   thing must be gotten rid of. Look at it. Face it, instead of running away from it. That's
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:09.800]   the second thing. And then, here is a third point. Remind yourself and impress upon yourself
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   the utter inconsistency of claiming to be a Christian but continuing to live in that
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:26.400]   way. So obvious, isn't it? And yet, have we all failed to do it? You have to look at
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.840]   yourself. You have to look at that old knife and you say, "Well, no, it is impossible.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   The thing is utterly inconsistent." You say, "I have no use for a man who's inconsistent.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.440]   I have no use for a hypocrite, a man who says one thing and does the other." Well, very
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.360]   well, what am I? How am I living? What do I claim? As a Christian, as a member of the
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.480]   Church, whether I like it or not, and whether I understand it or not, I am making a tremendous
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.280]   claim. As a Christian, as a man who calls himself a Christian, I am saying that I am
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:02.640]   a partaker of the divine nature. That Christ died to rescue me from this present evil world,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.240]   that I have been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.840]   Son. That's what I'm saying. I am saying that I am a member of the body of Christ,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.160]   and that by these bands of supply that the Apostle has been talking about, that the life
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:24.880]   of the blessed head is flowing into me. Is it consistent with all that to go on living
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.520]   like this? Is my conduct and my behavior to belong to the old realm when I claim to belong
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.960]   to this new realm? No, the New Testament is literally full of that kind of argument. Listen
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:44.440]   to Paul putting it to the Philippians, the next epistle, in chapter 1, verse 27. "Only
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ." You see the argument.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.720]   Is it becoming? Does it fit in with? You are familiar with the argument, the illustration.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.640]   "Don't have a clash of colors in your clothing," says the Apostle. "Don't dress in a manner
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:16.200]   that is inappropriate to what you are. Let your conversation, your conduct, be as becometh
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.040]   the gospel of Christ." See that your whole life is a life that will suggest to people
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:29.400]   that the Son of God left heaven and came into this world, and that he died upon the tree,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.800]   and that he rose again and sent the Holy Spirit. Let it be becoming.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:43.720]   Now let me tell you another incident out of my pastoral experience. Again, it sounds simple
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.960]   and almost trivial, but you know I always feel it is one of the greatest things that
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:56.640]   has ever come within the realm of my experience. You may laugh at this story very well, but
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   this is the story. A certain man in the early fifties who had lived a very evil and a dissolute
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   life. He had lived the life of a drunkard, a fighter, gambler, wife-beater, adulterer.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.440]   There was nothing, I imagine, short of murder that the man had not been guilty of. And indeed
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.640]   he would have been guilty of murder in many a drunken brawl if he had not been restrained
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:37.040]   by his own friends. He had a fiendish, foul temper, and he became mad and a drink. Well,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:46.840]   these men eventually came into the sound of the gospel and were converted.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   Now this is where the thing sounds almost ludicrous, but this was the fact. This was
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:01.640]   a tall man, athletic, well-built, a fighter. And there was one thing he was particularly
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:08.400]   proud of, and that was his moustache. Doesn't it sound ridiculous? But these are the sort
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:15.720]   of things people are proud of. And he took particular pride in this. It was the length
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:25.040]   of his moustache from tip to tip. Yes, I do understand the laughter, but I say again,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:34.640]   isn't it extraordinary what people are proud of? This was his particular matter of pride.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:42.240]   And the cause of most of his fighting happened to be these moustaches of his, because, you
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.520]   see, this was the sort of quarrel that arose. And men would challenge him that his moustache
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.800]   measured more from tip to tip than his. And so the quarrel began, and they ended in fighting.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.720]   And he was proud of this. No man could stand up to him, either in this length or in his
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:05.240]   prowess as a fighter. And there he came to the church, and he was converted. And we all
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:14.680]   saw all this. But this is the story. Some six weeks after that man's conversion, he
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:21.120]   came to a weeknight meeting, and I noticed immediately as he came in that the moustaches
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:31.360]   had gone. He had not merely cut off these ends, but he had shaved off the entire moustache.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.040]   My immediate reaction was one of annoyance. I said to myself, "Some busybody in this
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.400]   church has told this man to do that." Of course, the thing was laughable. The thing
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.520]   was quite foolish to see a grown-up man with these enormous moustaches. And I thought some
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.560]   busybody had gone to him and had told him to shave off his moustache. So at the end
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.880]   of the meeting, as he was going out, I stopped him. I said I wanted a word with him. And
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:03.040]   I said, "Who told you to get rid of these moustaches?" "Nobody's." I said, "Now
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.640]   come along. Don't you shield anybody. This kind of busybody does great harm in the church,
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.680]   these self-appointed spiritual detectives. I'm out to get rid of them." I said, "You
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:21.560]   tell me the truth." I said, "Who told you to get rid of those moustaches?" He said,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.840]   "Nobody's told me." I pressed him hard. He persisted. I said, "Why have you got
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.200]   rid of them?" He said, "I'll tell you." He said, "I was getting up actually this
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:39.960]   morning, and I'd washed. I'd gone to the looking-glass, and I was there, brushing my
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:49.680]   hair. I suddenly saw my moustaches, and I said to myself, 'Them things don't belong
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.240]   to a Christian.' So I cut off the ends," he said, "and I shaved off the rest."
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:03.440]   Now that man couldn't read nor write. He'd lived such a dissolute, evil life. He'd
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.160]   been brought up in that way, illiterate. He couldn't write. He couldn't read. That
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:16.120]   was his expression. "Them things don't belong to a Christian." Illiterate and ignorant,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:23.160]   yes, but he'd been born again, and the Spirit of God had come into him. The Spirit of God,
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.760]   with its unction and anointing, had taught him the lesson. "Them things don't belong
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:35.920]   to a Christian. Put off the old men," and he'd put him off in that respect. They belonged
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:47.000]   to the old life. They had nothing to do with this new life. So he'd put them off. Very
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.160]   simple, isn't it? Ignorant, illiterate men. I would to God that this church were full
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:03.200]   of such people. I see Christians today, even deliberately, it seems to me, putting on the
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.440]   old men. Putting on things that belong to the life of the flesh and the devil and the
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:21.040]   world. And they have not yet realized that "them things don't belong to the Christian."
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:30.120]   That's the argument of the apostle. Work it out for yourselves, my friends, in detail.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:38.160]   The Christian should not even look like the typical man or woman of the world. There are
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:46.480]   certain things that are incompatible with this new life. Put them off. Get rid of them.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.360]   Very well, let's go on to the next step, which is this. I quote to you a word again
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:01.320]   of the apostle in the next chapter. "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:08.560]   darkness, but rather reprove them." Now the material point here, the operative phrase
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:15.440]   is, "No fellowship." In other words, he says, "Have nothing at all to do with them.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:24.760]   Be drastic. Have no dealings at all with them." The important principle, it seems to me, is
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:33.920]   this. Watch the beginning. Have no parleying. Have no discussion. Have nothing at all to
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.800]   do with sin, if you are a wise man. Put off the old men altogether. Haven't we all proved
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:51.560]   this in experience? The moment you even listen to the devil, you are practically gone. If
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.640]   you have a discussion with him, it is certain that you are defeated. Don't have any talk
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.400]   with the devil. Have nothing to do with him at all. Don't speak to him. Don't be on
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.000]   speaking terms with him. If you begin to talk to the devil and listen to him, and to say,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   "Well, why not? I want to understand." You might as well fall to the ground. You
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.160]   are already beaten. He will beat you every time. He is subtle. He is clever. He is brilliant
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.440]   at the art of repartee. He knows all the arguments. If you begin to have any parleyings with sin,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.640]   you are done for. Have nothing to do. Have no fellowship at all with the unfruitful works
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.240]   of darkness. I will put that as the next principle, if you like, like this. If you are doubtful
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.280]   about a thing, don't touch it. Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. He that eateth and
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.840]   doubteth is damned if he eateth, says Paul in the fourteenth of Romans. If you are in
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:48.160]   doubt about a thing, well, very well say no. Err on that side rather than on the other.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.920]   Things that are even doubtful should not be touched.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.560]   But then I come to another positive injunction which I want to emphasize, which is again
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:05.280]   a direct quotation from Scripture. In Romans 13, 14, the apostle says this, "Make not
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:15.000]   provision for the flesh." What a statement! "Make not or no provision for the flesh."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.160]   Romans 13, 14. What a tremendous thing it is. You remember the part that is played in
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   the life of Saint Augustine. What does he mean by saying we should not make provision
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:39.240]   for the flesh? What he means is this. Don't be fool enough to feed that old man that is
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:49.040]   in you. Don't be fool enough to lead yourself into temptation. Don't you make provision
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   for your flesh, the thing that gets you down? How do you do that? Well, I'll tell you
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.880]   how you do it. There are certain places that are bad for you. Stay out of them. To go into
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:04.040]   such places is making provision for the flesh. You know it certainly before you go in that
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.600]   if you go in, it will stimulate the flesh. That's making provision for the flesh, therefore,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:18.320]   to go into such a place. Places. But not only places, but also people. If there are certain
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.360]   people that always have a bad effect and influence upon you, avoid them. Put off the old men.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.720]   You don't pray about this. You don't argue. You don't need special guidance about this.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.240]   If experience teaches you that such a person invariably tends to have a bad influence upon
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:42.720]   you, avoid such a person. Make no provision for the flesh. And likewise, as I've often
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:50.080]   pointed out with reading. I have no hesitation in saying that the newspapers, the popular
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.120]   newspapers of this country today, are undoubtedly the worst influence of all as regards the
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:03.720]   spiritual life. They are full of suggestion and innuendo. So be discriminating and careful
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:11.680]   as you read your newspaper. Avoid that which tends to harm you and to drag you down. Make
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.520]   no provision for the flesh. Listen to it in the Old Testament. Listen to Job. Job, you
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.720]   see, what a godly man he was, what a good man. But this is what he says. "I made a
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:29.800]   covenant with mine eyes." That's Job 31.1. "I made a covenant with mine eyes." In the
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.840]   seventh verse of that same thirty-first chapter he says, "If my step hath turned out of the
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:43.400]   way and mine heart walked after mine eyes." You see, your heart goes after your eyes,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.600]   the eyes of the trouble. And you see something in your heart goes after it. So says Job,
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.840]   "I made a covenant with mine eyes." Let me put that positively as you find it in Proverbs
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:03.760]   4.25. "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee."
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:09.000]   If there is something there that is enticing, don't look at it. That is what is meant by
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.320]   putting off the old man. Make a covenant with your eyes. Look straight on. Don't let your
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.280]   eyes wander. Don't let them lust after things. Don't let them go from the straight path.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.520]   This is biblical teaching. You see, you don't just pray about it. No, no, you must just
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:33.120]   not look. Keep your eyes from things that are likely to entice you or to attract you,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.560]   whatever they are. Make a covenant with your eyes. Look straight onwards. Keep steadfast
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.760]   looking in the direction of God and of heaven and of holiness. Make no provision for the
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.480]   flesh.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:55.280]   And then that brings me to the last principle, which is this. And I have tried to put them
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   in an ascending order. Not only must we not make any provision for the flesh, we are actually
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:13.120]   told to mortify the flesh. "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:20.160]   ye shall live," says Paul in Romans 8 and 13. And did you notice what we read in Colossians
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:30.000]   3.15? This morning he puts it there quite plainly, not in Colossians 3.5. "Mortify
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.400]   therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.520]   affection, evil concupiscence, covetousness which is idolatry." Mortify your members
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.400]   that are on the earth. You've got to do it, and I've got to do it. It isn't done for
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.480]   us. It isn't all taken out of us in a marvelous, thrilling experience. No, no. We've got to
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:56.360]   mortify our members that are on the earth. We've got to mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.560]   Through the Spirit, the Spirit is given. We have the Spirit. Well then, says the apostle
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:07.360]   in his power, "Mortify." What does mortify mean? It means to deaden. It means to deliberately
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:13.520]   attack. It means to starve so that they will die of indolence, withhold food from them,
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.980]   make no provision for them, in other words. And then another good way of mortifying something
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:24.760]   is not to use it. If you don't use your muscles, they'll atrophy and you'll become weak.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:30.480]   Well, that's a very good way of mortifying. Don't use. Withhold the food and the sustenance,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.520]   and don't use. And as you do those two things, these things will gradually become dead and
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.920]   will gradually become mortified. But let me put it again. The apostle even goes further.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:50.440]   We mustn't merely not feed the flesh and the body in this evil sense. We must not only
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.640]   not exercise the body in that respect. The apostle, you remember, went further in 1 Corinthians
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.840]   9. "I therefore so run," he says, "not as uncertainly, so fight I, but not as one that
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:10.480]   beateth the air." Well, what does he do then? "But," he says, "I keep under my body and
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.840]   bring it unto subjection." Ah, but say these other spiritual people, that's legalism. That's
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:21.360]   a man doing something, falling back on works. But it's the apostle who teaches it, you know.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.320]   You've got to keep under your body. Do you know the meaning of that term? Do you know
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.620]   the word that the apostle actually used, which is here translated "keep under the body"?
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:40.120]   This is the literal meaning, to hit under the eye, to buffet or disable an antagonist as
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.840]   a pugilist. That's what the apostle actually said. "I hit myself under the eye," he says,
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:51.920]   "I'm like a boxer, I'm not beating the air. I'm pummeling myself, I'm hitting myself black
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:42:01.160]   and blue. I'm giving myself black eyes, this flesh that gets me down. I keep under my body
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:11.720]   and bring it unto subjection." That's Christianity. So you don't say about this, do you? Oh, it's
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.840]   quite simple. Just let up the blinds and the sun comes in, it's all gone, but it doesn't
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.240]   all go. And people who say that know that it doesn't all go. And there have been people
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.760]   for years who have been trying to lift up the blinds, and they're still defeated by
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:33.480]   particular things. Of course they are. They're not scriptural, they're denying the scripture.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:43.240]   "I keep under my body, I buffet it. I hit it under the eye with all my force. I hate
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   it, I'm up against an antagonist, and as a pugilist I'm knocking him, and I'm trying
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:55.760]   to knock him out." That's the scriptural method. So we not only do not make provision for the
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:05.840]   flesh, we must mortify the flesh. Keep it under, keep it down, realizing that unless
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:15.360]   we do so, it will get us down temporarily, and we shall be living a contradictory life.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.560]   Well, there is the essence of the teaching. Oh, how I could expend it, and oh, how it
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.800]   was expended. Read John Owen, if you like, on the mortification of the flesh. You'll
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.680]   find it's quite a volume. Of course it is. These things have got to be worked out in
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.440]   detail. But there I've given you the principles this morning. Then whatever it is that troubles
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   you, put it up and look at it in the light of all these principles. Don't run away, don't
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.520]   be frightened, don't just say, "I must try and pray." Look at the thing and work it out,
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:52.200]   put it in the light of this context, and then apply these principles and go for it in the
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:44:01.280]   power of the Spirit. Put off the old men. Do that in detail. The apostle goes on to
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:08.480]   details as you remember. Lying, stealing, filthy communications, he takes them up one
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:17.720]   by one, and he says, "You've got to do this with regard to every single item." And thus,
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:30.560]   you put off that old man that is corrupt and dying and decaying according to the lusts
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:38.280]   of deceit. May God give us honesty. May God open our eyes to the Scripture. May God save
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:45.840]   us from bypassing the Scripture and eliminating all sections of it in the interest of a theory.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:57.560]   And as he does so, and as we rise, realizing that we have the Spirit of God within us,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:06.800]   we shall find ourselves being unable to put off the old man and all that is so horribly
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:15.480]   true of him that we no longer may disgrace the fair and the glorious name of our blessed
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:28.760]   Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Put off the old man.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
