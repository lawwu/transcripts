[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   >> I've been a Boglehead since 2004,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.940]   when I was broke.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.040]   Right at the beginning, I was just literally starting to earn money.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760]   And it's been 20 years, it's been a wonderful journey.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.880]   This is probably my fifth or sixth time at the conference.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.720]   It's a wonderful conference to be at.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.480]   And as we talked about, what are we gonna put in the 501 course this year?
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.200]   I said, well, something I don't think we've ever covered before is something I
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.480]   talk about all the time to groups of doctors, which is asset protection.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.000]   So that's gonna be our topic for the next half hour.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.120]   And then we've got two more great presenters that we're gonna be
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520]   bringing on to finish this up.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.320]   But we'll have a five minute break after this presentation, and
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.600]   then we'll go into our last two.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.680]   So a few disclosures and disclaimers.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.460]   I'm not a lawyer, I'm not an accountant, I'm not a financial advisor,
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.560]   I'm an emergency physician.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.440]   Right now, I'm even disabled from doing that, I'm a blogger.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.600]   So this is for your entertainment and general education.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.840]   This is not personalized, formal advice.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.800]   And the only relevant financial relationship I have
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.520]   is I have a few advertisers on my blog that sell malpractice insurance.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.920]   So I'm not gonna tell you who they are.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.400]   So I don't think there's a real conflict there.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.640]   Here's what we're gonna talk about, though.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.280]   We're gonna talk about how to get sued less.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.520]   And I'm gonna use a little bit of insight from my own profession of
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.820]   medicine with that.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.700]   And then we're gonna talk about what people are really worried about,
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.380]   which is above policy limit judgments.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.260]   We'll talk about the general principles of asset protection, and
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.660]   then I'm gonna tell you what a basic asset protection plan looks like that you
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.220]   probably all ought to have.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.180]   Then we're gonna talk about the complex ones that few of you ought to have, but
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340]   should be somewhat interesting.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.980]   The first thing, how to get sued less.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.880]   Be competent at what you do, and be nice to people, okay?
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.000]   People sue you when you screw up, and they sue you when you're a jerk, okay?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800]   The literature's very clear on this.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.080]   It also helps if you avoid some high-risk activities.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   Well, what are the high-risk activities in your life?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.360]   In my case, practicing medicine is a high-risk activity.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.040]   It may be the case with your profession as well.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.560]   But it might be the pool, or the trampoline in the backyard, a playground.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.140]   It might be the Rottweiler you have.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.860]   It might be that you have a boat you're always inviting people out on, or
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.100]   you fly, or you let people use your ATVs.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.260]   But you know what's interesting is when you really look at the data of when people
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.820]   use their umbrella personal liability policies, 80% of those uses are auto-related.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.100]   Auto-related is driving around is your big risk.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.540]   If you're not a doctor practicing medicine, driving around is your big risk.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.980]   So don't drive drunk, don't drive tired, don't drive long distances if you can
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.340]   avoid it, don't drive in heavy traffic, etc.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.780]   That's how you don't get sued, stop driving around.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.420]   Okay, this is interesting here, this is from the medical literature.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.940]   They studied a bunch of things, which doctors get sued?
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.500]   And it turned out that the only things that actually matter in everything they
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.820]   studied was how long you've been practicing and how many patients you see.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.820]   >> [LAUGH] >> It was exposure.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.700]   The more patients you see, the more likely you are to be sued.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.020]   And it's the same in your life.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.580]   The more miles you drive, the more likely you are to be sued, or
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.220]   the more teenage drivers you have in your household,
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.060]   the more likely you are to be sued.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.500]   Those are your risks, so reduce those.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.660]   If you're a doctor, you're seeing fewer patients per hour working fewer days a
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   month, fewer years of practice before you retire, prevents lawsuits.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.980]   It also helps to over communicate, okay?
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.980]   Patients and families, they'll help you avoid committing malpractice.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.060]   And if you talk to them, they'll be less likely to sue you.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.980]   This is an interesting study from OBs,
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.220]   who are some of the most highly sued doctors.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.180]   They asked the people who sued them, why did you sue?
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.380]   And look at all these high percentage reasons.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.660]   They didn't warn me about long term neurodevelopmental issues.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.700]   The doctor didn't tell them something.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.500]   They attempted to mislead me, okay?
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.020]   They wouldn't talk openly.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.340]   They covered it up.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.820]   I needed information.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.700]   The physician wouldn't listen.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.780]   Look at all the things you can do to prevent lawsuits.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.020]   The other stuff you might not be able to do much about, but
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900]   look at all the things you could have done to prevent a lawsuit.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.780]   Talking to people, over communicating, and of course, being nice.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.700]   This is a fun study, primary care docs this time.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.140]   They looked at the ones with no claims against them versus doctors with claims.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.380]   The ones with no claims told the patients what to expect more often.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.740]   They used more humor.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.300]   They solicited the patient's opinion.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.060]   They made sure the patient understood.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.820]   They encouraged the patients to talk.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.580]   They spent longer with the patients, less likely to be sued.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.900]   Be competent, be nice.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.980]   And then of course, know where lawsuits are coming from.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.260]   In my specialty of emergency medicine, 20 years ago when I started,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.700]   it was missed heart attacks.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.260]   You didn't diagnose a heart attack, you should have diagnosed, or
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.820]   you didn't diagnose an appendicitis, you should have diagnosed.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.700]   These days it's missed strokes,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.140]   especially weird ones that just show up with dizziness.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.420]   That's what people miss these days.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.780]   So when you're seeing that sort of a patient, you pay extra attention.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.940]   Maybe do a few more studies.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.060]   You make sure you talk to the family, and you talk to the spouse, and
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.700]   you really put a little bit more effort in there.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.900]   So think about what your risks are, whatever your risks might be in your life,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.660]   put a little more attention into those.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.940]   Okay, let's talk about above policy limits judgments.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.460]   This is what we're worried about, right?
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.340]   Most of us carry some kind of liability insurance.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.980]   But we're worried we'll be sued for more than that, and they'll clean us out.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.180]   Okay, so this is like a judgment of $1 million when your policy limits are $100,000,
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.980]   or $10 million when you have $1 million policy limits.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.300]   This is the big fear, right?
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.740]   So, you worry when you see articles like this show up,
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.380]   the biggest medical malpractice verdicts of 2019.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.100]   And here's what some of them are listed, $205 million for not doing a c-section.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.220]   I got news for you.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.800]   There isn't an OB in this country who carries a $205 million liability policy.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.060]   It just doesn't happen, right?
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.420]   101 for this, 23 for that, 10, 1.2 for this.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.580]   That's what people are worried about.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.900]   They see these headlines, and then some of the law firms kind of brag about them.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.020]   They got all these high-dollar listed things,
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.900]   every one they've ever won, they put up there.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.960]   But here's what people don't tell you.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.100]   The jury verdict does not equal what the defendant pays,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.120]   much less what the victim receives, okay?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.300]   You guys remember the McDonald's case, right?
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.860]   Everybody remembers the McDonald's case.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.020]   They handed them a hot cup of coffee and the lid wasn't on or whatever.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.220]   They dropped in their lap, burned themselves, right?
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.180]   Well, they got a $2.86 million jury verdict, okay?
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.380]   Of which $2.7 million was punitive, to punish McDonald's for doing this.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.660]   Well, the patient was judged to be 20% at fault cuz they spilled the coffee, so
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.500]   multiply that by 80% to start with.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.220]   And then your punitive damages got reduced to $480,000, okay?
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.520]   So in total, it might have been a $2.86 million jury verdict, but
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.700]   it was settled for 600.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.780]   And that sort of thing is actually really common in lawsuits.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.300]   Cuz a lot of times the defendant has an advantage, okay?
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.580]   They're asymmetric stakes.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.680]   This is especially true with doctors, right?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.700]   It's asymmetric.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.940]   They don't want any lawsuits on their record.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.220]   And so they're gonna defend against this little thing with everything they've got,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.140]   and so is their insurance company.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.580]   And so if it's a low odds claim, the patient might go away,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.700]   whereas the doctor's willing to go full bore on it.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.500]   Asymmetric risk tolerance, the plaintiffs will often settle at a discount.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.740]   And it turns out when it does go to trial, the plaintiffs almost never win.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.700]   And those verdicts are routinely settled for less.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.900]   And the defendants often have more resources.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.940]   That's why they're being sued.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.500]   And so they have superior access to useful resources.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   So the truth about asset protection and lawsuits cleaning you out
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.940]   is that it actually doesn't happen that much, okay?
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.460]   The payouts are actually much less than you would expect them to be, okay?
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.220]   This is a legal paper from 2015.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.620]   They looked at many, many years of lawsuits in Texas.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.020]   15,000 actual payouts among 28,000 doctors in that time period.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.300]   8.8 billion total was paid out.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.620]   Only 77 out-of-pocket payments were paid, right?
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.140]   It was just $16 million, about $30 a doc a year, right?
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.200]   Everyone's worried about these out-of-pocket judgments.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.940]   8.8 billion paid out, which only 16 million was above policy limits, right?
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.820]   It's a tiny, tiny percentage, okay?
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.340]   And here's what they look like, right?
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.340]   This is the way most distributions are here.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.300]   If this is your policy limits, a whole bunch of people get policy limits.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.180]   Lots of people get something less.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.900]   There's one above policy limits one there, right there.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.500]   There's another one right there, right?
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.420]   And right there, that's it, okay?
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.860]   Above policy limit judgments, very, very rare, that aren't reduced on appeal.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.380]   Again, you see the amounts when they're above policy limits.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.420]   There's a fair amount that is less than 500,000 here, and a few that are over.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.100]   And you can kind of see those here, right?
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.060]   This thing we all fear, that there's gonna be an $8 million judgment against us,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.900]   it just doesn't happen.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.900]   Now, it stinks to get an $80,000 out-of-pocket payment, but
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.740]   that usually isn't going to cause you to have to declare bankruptcy.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.860]   So over 18 years, they had 77 total payments, 43 of them less than 100,000.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:51.180]   15, less than a quarter million, 19, more than that, the median was only 62,000.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.300]   It's just not this huge thing out there.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.820]   So I hope that reduces the anxiety about lawsuits.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.180]   And I think among other things, personal lawsuits and
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.220]   other professions is even less than it is for these docs.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.660]   So what do attorneys say?
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.620]   This guy says, in 50 years of litigating them,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.940]   I've never attempted to go after a doctor's assets.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.860]   Another one says, we share a norm, we only go after their personal assets in
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.460]   egregious circumstances, like when they're doing heinous behaviors like drunk driving,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.340]   or when they intentionally, and this is important, intentionally underinsure.
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.140]   The attorneys say it's usually unprofitable for
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.100]   the attorneys to go after personal assets, therefore we reserve it for
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.300]   unusual situations when the normal economic incentives do not apply or
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.140]   are overridden.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.900]   We've never had a case in which a doctor had to pay his own money for
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.660]   an excess judgment.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.860]   We feel the doctor isn't liable and the case is defendable.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.420]   We'll do what's right.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.180]   So the insurance company will even pick it up if it's above policy limits.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.660]   Defendants say, or defense attorneys say, if he's let his coverage lapse or
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.460]   only has 1 million when he should have 3 million,
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.420]   then he may have to come up with some of his own money.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.260]   Those sums are usually nominal, 25 or 50,000, that may sting, but
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.940]   it won't wipe the doctor out, okay?
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.740]   Above policy limit judgments, not as big a deal as you might think.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.300]   So what can you do to avoid above policy limit judgments?
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.580]   Well, number one, avoid lawsuits.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.460]   Number two, and I think this is the biggest point in this whole presentation,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.060]   is carry enough liability insurance, okay?
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.500]   Don't be afraid to settle, right?
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.620]   We're just talking about money here.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.900]   It's just money.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.860]   And if you're settling, you're almost surely doing it for
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.460]   less than policy limits, it's not your money.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.780]   It's the insurance company's money, okay?
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.020]   So don't be afraid to settle.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.980]   Don't do something just to make the plaintiff or their attorney mad, okay?
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.660]   Don't provoke them.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.140]   And you might consider high-low agreements, right?
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.780]   Whereas if they win, they don't get more than a certain amount,
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.180]   like your policy limits.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.420]   If they lose, they don't get less than a certain amount, right?
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.260]   High-low agreements can keep you from having above policy limit judgments.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.540]   And then, of course, avoiding judicial hell holes, okay?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.460]   Where are they?
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.300]   Well, this is where they were in 2019, 2020.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.620]   Sorry for those of you who happen to live in one.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.220]   But that list changes year to year.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.900]   Usually, something in Illinois and something in southern Florida is on
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.020]   the list, but otherwise, they tend to change around a little bit.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.380]   Okay, let's talk about asset protection.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.180]   The most important thing to know about asset protection is all the laws are
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.540]   state-specific, okay?
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.580]   So you have to know your state's laws.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.220]   I wrote a book on asset protection.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.740]   The entire second half of the book is literally just a list of all the laws in
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.540]   each state, because that's what you have to know, because it varies by state.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.740]   Anything you do for asset protection, you have to do in advance and
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.340]   for another purpose, like estate planning or for your business purposes or whatever.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.580]   If you're doing it just for asset protection,
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.980]   the judge is going to say, no, that's not going to work.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.500]   You can't really hide assets.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.180]   These people are out there trying to sell you asset protection plans
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.460]   to keep anybody from finding out what you own.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.420]   Well, no, they sit you down in the chair, and they say, what do you own?
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.500]   And if you lie, you're going to jail.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.660]   So hiding stuff doesn't work.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.940]   They're going to find out what you own.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.060]   There are no guarantees in asset protection, right?
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.180]   We all want guarantees.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.980]   We want to know, are my money safe?
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.620]   There's no guarantees, okay?
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.660]   Everything's probability based.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.380]   And there's usually a cost to doing particularly complex
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.220]   asset protection techniques.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.940]   It's going to be higher taxes, or you're going to have lower returns, or
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.820]   you're going to have legal fees.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.700]   You're not going to have as much control over the asset, or whatever.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.220]   There is a cost to most of the stuff you do for asset protection.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.460]   One big idea that you use is you use exemptions, okay?
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.340]   So things in your state are exempt.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.620]   Meaning that if you get a $10 million judgment against you, and
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.540]   your insurance cannot pay, and you have to declare bankruptcy, guess what?
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.260]   You get to keep something, and it varies by state what you get to keep.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.620]   Jurisdictions, different states, different countries,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.180]   they have different laws, okay?
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.220]   So some asset protection is all about putting things in the states and
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.540]   the countries that have the good laws, right?
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.100]   That's what it is.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.180]   Okay, so what does a basic asset protection plan look like?
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.780]   Number one is reduce your risk and the likelihood of a lawsuit.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.940]   We talked about that.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.140]   Change where you live, have the best professional practices,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.420]   get rid of that old trampoline that doesn't even have a net around it in
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.460]   the backyard, that's what you do, number one.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.900]   Number two, insurance is your first line of defense.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.020]   If you're in a profession that should have it, malpractice insurance, okay?
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.140]   But everybody ought to have personal liability insurance.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.820]   The crazy thing is that your state's minimum is probably like $50,000 or
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.340]   $100,000.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.500]   Meanwhile, there's people driving around in $140,000 Teslas, okay?
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.860]   And they're worth themselves a whole lot more than the Tesla is.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.260]   You gotta have higher liability insurance than that.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.700]   You gotta raise it, okay?
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.300]   You can't have that on your auto, you can't have that on your homeowners.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.700]   You gotta increase it.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.580]   The good news is this costs a lot less than a lot of other insurances,
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.940]   cuz it doesn't get used that often.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.260]   And then, of course, you can stack a personal liability policy on top of your
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.740]   auto and your homeowner's or renter's coverage.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.620]   That's called an umbrella policy, cuz it sits over, right, it's an umbrella.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.580]   And you can get a seven-figure amount there.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.940]   Well, most people will go away for a seven-figure settlement, okay?
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.340]   You'd be surprised how many people are willing to go away if you can give them
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.260]   a million dollars from your insurer, no matter what bad thing happened to them.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.940]   And so the good news is that's usually pretty cheap, $200, $300 a year.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.860]   It'll get you a million dollar umbrella coverage.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.780]   Okay, know your state exemptions and take advantage of them, okay?
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.860]   And these are super interesting if you dive into them, right?
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.180]   Like in Utah, you get a year's worth of food storage you get to keep, and
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.580]   you get to keep 120 rounds of ammunition.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.780]   In Texas, you get 120 ducks and 12 head of cattle.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.220]   There's all kinds of cool laws out there about this.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.820]   But mostly, what you need to know is retirement accounts are exempt, okay?
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.060]   ERISA retirement accounts, like your 401(k) or 403(b),
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.020]   you get to keep it if you're cleaned out.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.260]   One more reason to max that stuff out.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.140]   In many states, even non-ERISA retirement accounts like your IRA or
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.740]   Roth IRA, totally exempt, okay?
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.500]   So all the more reasons to do Roth conversions and
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.780]   move taxable money into retirement accounts.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   All the more reasons to max out your retirement accounts.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.140]   All the more reasons to spend from taxable first is asset protection.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.580]   Okay, there's also homestead laws.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.860]   What's a homestead law?
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.980]   Well, that means you get to keep some of your house, right?
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   We all remember O.J. Simpson, moved to Florida,
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.700]   got to keep his whole house when he was judged to be liable for what he did.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.340]   And that's the idea here, right?
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.820]   Texas, Florida have very good homestead laws.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.700]   Utah, where I live, not so much.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.260]   We get $42,000 of our home equity.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.500]   If we're single, 84,000 if we're married, that's it.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.380]   The rest of the home equity is gone, but that varies by state.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.420]   In many states, your cash value life insurance,
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.500]   your whole life insurance, you get to keep.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.080]   In some states, you get to keep annuities, okay?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.940]   Again, all varies by state.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.300]   Don't buy something for asset protection if your state doesn't even protect that
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.740]   thing.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.540]   Use corporations, use LLCs for toxic business assets.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.100]   These include rental properties.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:12.660]   Something can happen in a rental property that you'll be liable for as the owner.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.300]   In general, these are better if there's multiple members, not just one.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.460]   But it provides both external liability from something that happens in your
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.540]   personal life, keeps them from seizing what's in the LLC, as well as internal
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.860]   liability when something happens on the property the LLC owns.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.100]   Keeps them from getting to your personal assets.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.360]   And of course, you have to keep a strict division between your business assets and
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.460]   your personal assets.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.740]   Okay, here's a really great asset protection plan.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.540]   Give your money away.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.940]   Now you can't lose it.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.420]   Now you can't give it away after you've done something that's gonna cause you to
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.660]   be sued, right?
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.420]   That's a fraudulent conveyance.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.500]   Or worse, after you've been sued, you can't do that.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.580]   But you put money in a daff, guess what?
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.860]   It's not yours anymore.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.740]   You give it to your kids or your other heirs, it's not yours anymore, right?
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.860]   And that can be an irrevocable trust.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.060]   Okay, and one of the last things you ought to do is make sure you've titled your
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.620]   property properly.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.940]   Okay, one really cool thing from asset protection perspective
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.580]   is tenants by the entirety titling.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.420]   That means you and your spouse both own the entire property.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.220]   So if just one of you gets sued, you can't lose the property,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.140]   because your spouse owns the whole thing.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.180]   It's very cool.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.900]   You can also do it for brokerage accounts in many states.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.020]   These are the states where it's available.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.360]   Okay, if that's one of your states, unfortunately mine's not listed there.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.100]   And you're married, you ought to have your property titled tenants by
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.420]   the entirety for asset protection purposes.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.220]   Super cheap asset protection technique, works very well.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.700]   Okay, let's talk for just a minute about some complex asset protection techniques
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.540]   that may or may not be worth it.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.580]   In general, the more complex it is, the less well it works, the more it costs, and
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.860]   the more hassles there are associated with it, okay?
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.060]   Equity stripping.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.660]   This is when you live in a state with really low homestead laws.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.860]   And you're like, well, I'm gonna take all my equity out of my house with a HELOC.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.300]   And I'm gonna put it in, since my state protects whole life insurance,
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.740]   I'm gonna buy a big whole life insurance policy, right?
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.300]   That's equity stripping.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.340]   A domestic asset protection trust, these are pretty cool.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.460]   They're available in a lot of states, including mine.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.460]   You can put your house or
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.220]   other assets inside a domestic asset protection trust.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.220]   Where you're both the grantor and the beneficiary.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.020]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.820]   If it works, it's great.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.540]   There's still some doubt out there about how well these work all the time.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.580]   But all it costs you is the cost of setting it up.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.180]   Foreign asset protection trust, right?
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.100]   Everyone here is about putting your money down in the Cook Islands or something.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.220]   The problem with this is a lot of times, it puts you at risk of contempt of court.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.980]   Right, they tell you, bring your assets back or we're gonna put you in jail.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.260]   Well, okay, I guess I'll bring my assets back since I don't wanna go to jail.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.780]   Delaware bank accounts also have been pierced, but
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.380]   there is some potential asset protection there.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.300]   Family limited partnerships and LLCs, they're really helpful if you're trying
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.940]   to pass your business along to your kids and provide some substantial
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.660]   asset protection techniques.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.020]   Not cheap, definitely some complexity there, but some possibility there if
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.620]   you're trying to pass something like that along to your heirs.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.540]   And obviously, if you're gonna do a family LLC,
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.900]   you need to be in a state with pretty strong LLC law, right?
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   If they're not limiting the creditors to a charging order,
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.180]   it's not really gonna do you as much good as you probably hoped.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.300]   Okay, so here's what we talked about.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.340]   We talked about reducing your liability,
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.500]   consciously do things to try to get sued less.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.660]   Buy plenty of insurance.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.780]   It's cheap, it's your first line of defense.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.780]   Lawsuits almost never go past the insurance.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.260]   It pays for your defense and it pays for any judgments or settlements.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.820]   Know your state asset protection laws, okay?
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.300]   It's really important you understand what those are.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.460]   Any technique you decide to implement must be employed in advance.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.300]   You can't wait until you get sued and then do this stuff.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.740]   It's too late then.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.380]   Max out your retirement accounts.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.940]   Use tenants by the entirety titling if appropriate and available.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.180]   And if you've still got a lot at stake that's outside things that are protected
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.340]   from the basic techniques,
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.780]   you might consider some of the complex asset protection techniques.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.140]   All right, I think I've got about two minutes for questions.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.820]   You got those for me, Mike?
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.540]   And I got a couple here.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:36.140]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.940]   >> All right, retirement accounts are not protected in case of divorce.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.020]   That's absolutely true.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.300]   But they generally are from declaring bankruptcy.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.620]   All right, let's see here.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.180]   I gotta put glasses on to read this one.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:54.180]   Does having an umbrella policy make you a juicy target?
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.100]   That's a good question.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.780]   I like this one.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.820]   People worry because they have all this liability insurance that people
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.620]   will actually sue them more.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.140]   This is not the case in medicine, okay?
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.660]   Having insurance does not make you more likely to be sued.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.980]   I suspect that extends to most other things.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.100]   The truth is most people don't know you've got significant
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.340]   liability insurance until they sue you, okay?
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.380]   So I don't think it really attracts lawsuits.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.020]   Maybe you don't wanna advertise that you got a $5 million umbrella policy.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.380]   But I don't think it really makes it more likely for you to get sued.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.660]   And let's see how much time we got for your break here.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.620]   We got a little bit of time.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.820]   Okay, how do you relate personal net worth to umbrella policy?
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.900]   Does your umbrella policy just keep going up with your net worth?
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.100]   Okay, I like this question.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.900]   People are like, well, how much should I have, right?
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.900]   Well, how much should you have?
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.060]   Well, how much are you gonna be sued for?
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.660]   That's how much you should have.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.860]   And of course, you have no idea, right?
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.180]   So people put these weird formulas together like that it's supposed to equal
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.100]   your net worth.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.180]   No, has nothing to do with your net worth.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.540]   You can have a net worth of 500,000, you can be sued for 10 million.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.860]   You could have a net worth of 10 million, you can be sued for 500,000.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   It has nothing to do with your net worth.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.260]   So my general guideline is what will people be happy with if you settled for
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.500]   policy limits as a general rule?
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.580]   And in my experience, most Americans think a seven-figure amount,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.400]   a million dollars is still a lot of money.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.700]   If they can walk away with a million dollars from whatever mistake you made or
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.260]   whatever happened on your property, they're usually pretty happy.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.740]   And that's a relatively cheap umbrella policy.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.740]   But these people run around with $50,000 on their car, that's crazy.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.700]   You shouldn't have only $50,000 of liability coverage, it's just not enough.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.420]   Now, if you're particularly well-to-do, I mean, a few years ago when we became more
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.020]   financially successful, we increased our umbrella policy.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.500]   And I think we've got a 5 million policy now.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.820]   But that's not tied to net worth in any way, shape, or form.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.900]   It's just like, well, we can afford this, it's not that much more.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.660]   And if someone had a little bit higher lawsuit,
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.100]   we'd have a little bit more coverage.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   I'll tell you what, if you got a $5 million policy,
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.300]   the insurance company's gonna send their best people to defend you, so.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.780]   >> [LAUGH] >> All right,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.300]   I think we got time here for one more before we go to break.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.220]   Does the issuer of the umbrella insurance policy matter?
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.260]   Should I dump GEICO and go for a high-end umbrella insurance company?
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.940]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.620]   I think the way the policies are written,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.700]   I think the company's on the hook for it.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.140]   And I think they're gonna do well,
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.300]   hire some good attorneys to defend you and fight hard to do it.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.380]   I don't think it matters a lot.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.660]   I think most people, what they do is they go, who's doing my home in auto?
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.340]   And that's where they get their umbrella policy from.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.820]   So it's not super complicated.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.740]   Okay, let's take a break here.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:57.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
