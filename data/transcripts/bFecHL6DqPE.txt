[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   So if you had three things to avoid and three things to do for everyone, what would be the
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   top three things that you would pick for both?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.260]   Three things to avoid, I have a new book called YOUR BRAIN IS ALWAYS LISTENING and I would
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.000]   avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   That's the first thing I'd do, I mean I get conscious about loving my brain.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.780]   Too many people are just, they're just oblivious that whether it's the air they breathe or
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.640]   the water they drink or the food they eat or the thoughts they think, there's just,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.280]   they have no control and so I'd get rid of being oblivious and then I'd be intentional
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.440]   about food because food is so important.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.480]   I think 30% of the mental health problems in America are due to the standard American
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   diet which spells sad, standard American diet.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.800]   It's pro-inflammatory, happy meals are not happy, they're sad meals.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   When you think about it, it's like no and I turn off the gadgets and move, the gadgets
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   are causing us to be more sedentary and more overweight and so for do, it's purposeful,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   love your brain and move and eat.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.640]   Gotcha.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.560]   Was that three dos or was that three don'ts?
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.360]   Well love your brain, move, eat, write and avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon and watch
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.000]   the digital addiction and the standard American diet.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Gotcha.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Last question.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.040]   But it comes down to this one question.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   I worked with B.J. Fogg at Stanford for six months.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800]   He created something called Tiny Habits.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   What's the smallest thing I can do today that will make the biggest difference and we have
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.840]   50 tiny habits but the mother tiny habit is just ask yourself as you go through your day,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   is this good for my brain or bad for it?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.000]   And if you can answer that with information and love, love of yourself, love of your mission,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   why you're on the planet, love of your family and friends, begin making better decisions.
