[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   So if you had three things to avoid and three things to do for everyone, what would be the
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   top three things that you would pick for both?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.880]   Three things to avoid, I have a new book called YOUR BRAIN IS ALWAYS LISTENING.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800]   And I would avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon, that's the first thing I'd do.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.600]   I mean I get conscious about loving my brain.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   Too many people are just, they're just oblivious that whether it's the air they breathe or
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.640]   the water they drink or the food they eat or the thoughts they think, there's just,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.880]   they have no control.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.960]   And so I'd get rid of being oblivious.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.120]   And then I'd be intentional about food because food is so important.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.480]   I think 30% of the mental health problems in America are due to the standard American
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   diet which spells sad, standard American diet.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.800]   It's pro-inflammatory, happy meals are not happy, they're sad meals.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.880]   When you think about it, it's like no.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.800]   And I turn off the gadgets and move.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.640]   The gadgets are causing us to be more sedentary, more overweight.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.440]   So for do, it's purposeful, love your brain and move and eat.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.440]   Gotcha.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.840]   Was that three do's or was that three don'ts?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:50.360]   Well, love your brain, move, eat, right, and avoid the oblivious bad habit dragon and watch
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.960]   the digital addiction and the standard American diet.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   Gotcha.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   Last question.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   But it comes down to this one question.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.160]   I worked with B.J. Fogg at Stanford for six months.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800]   He created something called Tiny Habits.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.200]   It's the smallest thing I can do today that will make the biggest difference.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.760]   And we have 50 tiny habits.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.280]   But the mother tiny habit is just ask yourself as you go through your day, "Is this good
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.200]   for my brain or bad for it?"
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.960]   And if you can answer that with information and love, love of yourself, love of your mission,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   why you're on the planet, love of your family and friends, begin making better decisions.
