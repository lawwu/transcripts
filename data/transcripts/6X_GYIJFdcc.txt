[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   - First of all, you've described a fascinating thought,
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.360]   which is Stalin is having amassed arguably more power
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   than any man in history.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.020]   It's an interesting thing to think about.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.260]   But can you tell about his journey to getting that power
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.580]   after the Russian Revolution?
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.100]   How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.480]   about institutions and so on?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.180]   And just in general, the story I think is fascinating
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.400]   of how one man is able to get more power
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.120]   than any other man in history.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.100]   - It is a great story.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.360]   Not necessarily from a moral point of view,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060]   but if you're interested in power,
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.960]   for sure it's an incredible story.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   So we have to remember that Stalin
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.500]   is also a product of circumstances,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.220]   not solely his own individual drive, which is very strong.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.220]   For example, World War I breaks the Tsarist regime,
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.340]   the Tsarist order, Imperial Russian State.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.580]   Stalin has no participation whatsoever in World War I.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.980]   He spends World War I in exile in Siberia.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.940]   Until the downfall of the Tsarist autocracy
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.940]   in February 1917, Stalin is in Eastern Siberian exile.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.900]   He's only able to leave Eastern Siberia
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.440]   when that regime falls.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.220]   He never fights in the war.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.780]   He's called up briefly towards the end of the war
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.560]   and is disqualified on physical grounds
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.700]   because of physical deformities from being drafted.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.740]   The war continues after the Tsarist regime
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.660]   has been toppled in the capital
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.200]   and there's been a revolution.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.620]   The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.440]   The peasants begin to seize the land after the Tsar falls,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.780]   essentially destroying much of the gentry class.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540]   Stalin has nothing to do with that.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.180]   The peasants have their own revolution,
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.140]   seizing the land, not in law, but in fact,
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.100]   de facto, not de jure land ownership.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.580]   So there are these really large processes underway
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   that Stalin is alive during, but not a driver of.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.880]   The most improbable thing happens,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.400]   which is a very small group of people
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.760]   around the figure of Vladimir Lenin
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.720]   announces that it has seized power.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.960]   Now by this time in October 1917,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.280]   the government that has replaced the Tsar,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.080]   the so-called provisional government, has failed.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.040]   And so there's not so much power to seize
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160]   from the provisional government.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.280]   What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.120]   That is to say, Soviets or councils,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.080]   as we would call them in English,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.040]   which represent people's power
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   or the masses participating in politics,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.560]   a kind of radical grassroots democracy,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.800]   are extremely popular all over the country
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   and not dominated by any one group.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   But predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.440]   Russia has an election during the war,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.880]   a free and fair election for the most part,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.800]   despite the war, at the end of 1917, in December 1917,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.600]   and three quarters plus of the country votes socialist
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.900]   in some form or another.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.840]   So the battle was over the definition of socialism
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.240]   and who had the right to participate in defining socialism.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.360]   Not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.640]   So there's a coup by Lenin's group known as the Bolsheviks
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   against all the other socialists.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.420]   And so Lenin declares a seizure of power,
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.880]   whereby the old government has failed,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.220]   people's power, the councils known as the Soviets,
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.680]   are gonna take their place.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   And Lenin seizes power in the name of the Soviets.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.000]   So it's a coup against the left,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   against the rest of the left.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.960]   Not against the provisional government
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.120]   that has replaced the czar, which has already failed.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.640]   in this crazy seizure of power on the left
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.000]   against the rest of the left in October 1917,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.800]   which we know is the October Revolution.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.660]   And I call the October coup as many other historians call.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.600]   The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.000]   What's interesting about this episode
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.840]   is that the leftists who seize power
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.640]   in the name of the Soviets, in the name of the masses,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.360]   in the name of people's power, they retain their hold.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.880]   Many times in history there's a seizure of power
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.420]   by the left and they fail.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.060]   They collapse, they're cleaned out by an army
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.500]   or what we call forces of order,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.760]   by counter-revolutionary forces.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.960]   Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup is successful.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.660]   It is able to hold power and not just seize power.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.360]   They win a civil war and they're entrenched
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.380]   in the heart of the country already by 1921.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.640]   Stalin is part of that group.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   Lenin needs somebody to run this new regime
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.280]   in the kind of nitty gritty way.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.660]   Lenin is the leader, the undisputed leader
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.460]   in the Bolshevik Party, which changes their name
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.000]   to communists in 1918.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.860]   He makes Stalin the general secretary
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.420]   of the Communist Party.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.900]   He creates a new position, which hadn't existed before,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.980]   a kind of day-to-day political manager,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.780]   a right-hand man.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.560]   Not because Lenin is looking to replace himself,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.340]   he's looking to institutionalize a helpmate,
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.400]   a right-hand man.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.700]   He does this in the spring of 1922.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.480]   Stalin is named to this position,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.500]   which Lenin has created expressly for Stalin.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.900]   So there's been a coup on the left,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.020]   whereby the Bolsheviks, who become communists,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.940]   have seized power against the rest of the socialists
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.300]   and anarchists and the entire left.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.700]   And then there's an institutionalization of a position
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.820]   known as general secretary of the Communist Party,
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.220]   right-hand man of Lenin.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.660]   Less than six weeks after Lenin has created this position
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.520]   and installed Stalin, Lenin has a stroke,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.100]   a major stroke, and never really returns as a full actor
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.100]   to power before he dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.260]   So a position is created for Stalin
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.300]   to run things on Lenin's behalf,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.960]   and then Lenin has a stroke.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.460]   And so Stalin now has this new position general secretary,
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.900]   but he's the right hand of a person
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.900]   who's no longer exercising day-to-day control over affairs.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.420]   Stalin then uses this new position
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.060]   to create a personal dictatorship
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.940]   inside the Bolshevik dictatorship,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.780]   which is the remarkable story I tried to tell.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.200]   - So is there anything nefarious
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.100]   about any of what you just described?
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.260]   So it seems conveniently
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.100]   that the position is created just for Stalin.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.560]   There was a few other brilliant people,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.500]   arguably more brilliant than Stalin
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.140]   in the vicinity of Lenin.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.700]   Why was Stalin chosen?
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill?
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.720]   It's perhaps a conspiratorial question,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.180]   but is there anything nefarious
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.860]   about any of this historical trajectory to power
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.740]   that Stalin took in creating the personal dictatorship?
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.960]   - So history is full of contingency and surprise.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.620]   After something happens, we all think it's inevitable.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.760]   It had to happen that way.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.220]   Everything was leading up to it.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.640]   So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.940]   and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.380]   by several of his moves after being named chancellor.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.980]   And so all German history becomes a story
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.260]   of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler's rise to power.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.260]   Every trend, tendency is bent into that outcome.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.420]   Things which don't seem related to that outcome.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.740]   All of a sudden get bent in that direction.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.800]   And other trends that were going on are no longer examined
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.460]   because they didn't lead to that outcome.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.740]   But Hitler's becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.420]   was not inevitable, it was contingent.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.900]   He was offered the position
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.580]   by the traditional conservatives.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.980]   He's part of the radical right,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.900]   and the traditional right named him chancellor.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   The Nazi party never outright won an election
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.680]   that was free and fair before Hitler came to power.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.360]   And in fact, its votes on the eve
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.520]   of Hitler becoming chancellor declined
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.320]   relative to the previous election.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.560]   So there's contingency in history,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.280]   and so Lenin's illness, his stroke,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.520]   the neurological and blood problems that he had
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.600]   were not a structure in history.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.840]   In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.880]   Stalin might never have become the Stalin that we know.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.920]   That's not to say that all history is accidental,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.120]   just that we need to relate the structural,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.800]   the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.080]   Why did Lenin pick Stalin?
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.880]   Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer,
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.360]   and the position was an organizational position.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.440]   Stalin could get things done.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.600]   He would carry out assignments, no matter how difficult.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   He wouldn't complain that it was hard work or too much work.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.680]   He wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.200]   and ignore his responsibilities.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.920]   Lenin chose Stalin among other options
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.080]   because he thought Stalin was the better option.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.340]   Once again, he wasn't choosing his successor
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.880]   because he didn't know he was gonna have this stroke.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.920]   Lenin had some serious illnesses,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.700]   but he had never had a major stroke before.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.800]   So the choice was made based upon Stalin's
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.320]   organizational skills and promise
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.040]   against the others who were in the regime.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.720]   Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin,
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.240]   but he was more effective,
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.840]   and I'm not sure they were very brilliant.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.040]   - Well, he was exceptionally competent,
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.480]   actually, at the tasks for running a government,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.280]   the executive branch, right, of a dictator.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.760]   - Yes, he turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.340]   And so if he had been chosen by Lenin
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.000]   and had not been very good,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.160]   he would have been pushed aside by others.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.860]   You can get a position by accident.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.920]   You can be named because you're someone's friend
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.320]   or someone's relative, but to hold that position,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.560]   to hold that position in difficult circumstances,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.200]   and then to build effectively a superpower
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.680]   on all that bloodshed, right,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.100]   you have to be skilled in some way.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.000]   It can't be just accident that brings you to power
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.240]   because if accident brings you to power, it won't last.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.680]   Just like we discovered with Putin,
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.160]   he had some qualities that we didn't foresee
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.320]   at the beginning, and he's been able to hold power,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.840]   not just be named.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.240]   Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.320]   These are very different regimes.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.960]   I wouldn't put them in the same sentence.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.620]   My point is not that one resembles the other.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.000]   My point is that when people come to power
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.880]   for contingent reasons, they don't stay in power
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.960]   unless they're able to manage it.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.640]   And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.200]   inside that dictatorship.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.680]   He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.080]   He was very diligent.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.840]   He had a phenomenal memory, and so he could remember
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.440]   people's names and faces and events,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.680]   and this was very advantageous for him
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.640]   as he built the machine that became
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.080]   the Soviet state and bureaucracy.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.120]   - One of the things, maybe you can correct me
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.960]   if I'm wrong, you've made me realize
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.840]   is this wasn't some kind of manipulative personality
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.760]   trying to gain more power solely,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.380]   like kind of an evil picture of a person,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.460]   but he truly believed in communism.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.060]   As far as I can understand, again,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.200]   you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.120]   but he wanted to build a better world
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   by having, infusing communism into the country,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.100]   perhaps into the whole world.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   So maybe my question is what role does communism
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.500]   as an idea, as an ideology play in all of this,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.280]   in his rise to power, in the people of the time,
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.160]   in the Russian people, actually just the whole
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.280]   20th century?
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.480]   - You're right.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.960]   Stalin was a true believer, and this is very important.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.680]   He was also hungry for power and for personal power,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.160]   but just as you said, not for power's sake,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.840]   not only for power.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.760]   He was interested in enacting communism in reality,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.520]   and also in building a powerful state.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.080]   He was a statist, a traditional Russian statist
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.520]   in the imperial sense.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.000]   And this won him a lot of followers.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   The fact that they knew he was a hardcore,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.960]   true believing communist, won him a lot of followers
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   among the communists.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   And the fact that he was a hardcore defender
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.300]   of Russian state interests, now in the Soviet guise,
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.520]   also won him a lot of followers.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.160]   Sometimes those groups overlapped,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.920]   the communists and the Russian patriots,
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.500]   and sometimes they were completely different groups,
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.200]   but both of them shared an admiration
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.320]   for Stalin's dedication to those goals
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.120]   and his abilities to enact them.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.640]   And so it's very important to understand
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000]   that however thirsty he was for power,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.140]   and he was very thirsty for power,
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:21.520]   that he was also driven by ideals.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   Now, I don't necessarily think that everyone
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.320]   around Stalin shared those ideals.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.820]   We have to be careful not to make everybody
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.840]   into a communist true believer,
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.240]   not to make everybody into a great statist Russian patriot,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.960]   but they were widespread and powerful attractions
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.840]   for a lot of people.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.840]   And so Stalin's ability to communicate to people
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.640]   that he was dedicated to those pursuits
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.440]   and his ability to drive towards them
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.000]   were part of his appeal.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.400]   However, he also resorted to manipulation.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.160]   He also resorted to violence.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.760]   He lied, he spoke out of all sides of his mouth.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.840]   He slandered other people.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.520]   He sabotaged potential rivals.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.120]   He used every underhanded method,
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.680]   and then some, in order to build his personal dictatorship.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   Now, he justified this, as you said,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.280]   by appeals to communism and to Soviet power.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.740]   - To himself as well, too.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.640]   - To himself and to others.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.180]   And so he justified it in his own mind and to others,
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.580]   but certainly any means, right,
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:43.580]   were acceptable to him to achieve these ends.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.960]   And he identified his personal power with communism
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.420]   and with Russian glory in the world.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.120]   So he felt that he was the only one who could be trusted,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.080]   who could be relied upon to build these things.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.780]   Now, we put ourselves back in that time period.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.300]   The Great Depression was a very difficult time
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.720]   for the capitalist system.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.060]   There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship,
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:17.060]   fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.740]   There were a lot of associations that were negative
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.060]   with the kind of capitalist system
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   that was not 100%, not a monolith,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.480]   but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.600]   There was imperialism, colonies that even
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.200]   the democratic rule of law capitalist states
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   had non-democratic, non-rule of law colonies
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.880]   under their rule.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.700]   So the image and reality of capitalism
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.720]   during that time period between World War I
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.440]   and World War II was very different
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.520]   from how it would become later.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.060]   And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.460]   after World War I, before World War II,
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:09.340]   communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.720]   but even outside the Soviet Union,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.200]   because the image and reality of capitalism
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.300]   disappointed many people.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.840]   Now, in the end, communism was significantly worse.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.180]   Many more victims and the system, of course,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.700]   would eventually implode.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.660]   But nonetheless, there were real problems
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.220]   that communism tried to address.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.020]   It didn't solve those problems.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.240]   It was not a solution, but it didn't come out of nowhere.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.900]   It came out of the context of that interwar period.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.200]   And so Stalin's rule, some people saw it
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.540]   as potentially a better option than imperialism,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.540]   fascism, and Great Depression.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.860]   Having said that, they were wrong.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.980]   It turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.580]   to markets and private property
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.440]   and rule of law and democracy.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.260]   However, that didn't become clearer to people
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.980]   until after World War II,
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.560]   after Nazism had been defeated,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.980]   Imperial Japan had been defeated,
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.160]   Fascist Italy had been defeated,
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.420]   and decolonization had happened around the world,
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.780]   and there was a middle-class economic boom
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.740]   in the period from the late '40s through the '70s
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.100]   that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.700]   So capitalism rose from the ashes, as it were,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.900]   and this changed the game for Stalin and communism.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:45.100]   Communism is about an alternative to capitalism,
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.640]   and if that alternative is not superior,
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.800]   there's no reason for communism to exist.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.620]   But if capitalism is in foul odor,
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.540]   if people have a bad opinion,
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.520]   a strong critique of capitalism,
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.500]   there can be appeal to alternatives,
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.980]   and that's kind of what happened with Stalin's rule.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.200]   But after World War II, the context changed a lot.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.900]   Capitalism was very different, much more successful,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.060]   nonviolent compared to what it was in the interwar period,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.220]   and the Soviet Union had a tough time competing
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.080]   against that new context.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.240]   (silence)
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.400]   (silence)
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   (silence)
