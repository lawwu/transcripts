[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.180]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.460]   is for you.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.780]   So without further ado,
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.180]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.220]   The first question is about nature,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.520]   in particular about the scientifically supported benefits
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.780]   of getting outdoors into nature.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.380]   The person asks about the role of sunlight,
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.140]   the role of calming sounds,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.420]   the role of observing wildlife,
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.180]   of observing green colors and quote other stuff.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.580]   And in fact, I'm glad that they asked about other stuff
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.300]   because I get the question
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.820]   about the scientifically supported benefits of nature a lot.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.740]   I often also get the question about grounding.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.820]   For those of you that aren't familiar
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.300]   with what grounding is,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.380]   grounding is a practice of putting your feet
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.500]   on the earth directly with bare feet,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.260]   oftentimes into soil or on a lawn.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.180]   And it's a question that I seem to get more and more.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780]   In fact, every week for quite a long while now
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.060]   on social media or elsewhere,
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.640]   somebody asks me about the scientific support
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.520]   for this practice of grounding.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   So obviously there's a lot of interest
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960]   in what the scientific research says
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.540]   about getting into nature
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.460]   and putting one's feet on the ground,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.200]   AKA grounding and so on.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.700]   Okay, so if I'm going to answer this question,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.800]   I first have to be very direct with you.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.640]   There is excellent meaning dozens,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.140]   if not hundreds of quality peer reviewed studies
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.560]   which support the value of getting sunlight in one's eyes
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.380]   in particular early in the day to set their circadian rhythm.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.440]   This is something that I've talked about extensively
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.740]   on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.440]   and as a guest on other podcasts.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.500]   It's one of the first and frankly most important items
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.960]   on the toolkit for sleep,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.040]   which is a zero cost toolkit that you can access
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.580]   by going to HubermanLab.com,
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.420]   going to the menu, going to newsletter.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.560]   You can see it as a PDF there.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.960]   You don't have to sign up for the newsletter.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.640]   You can just access that toolkit for sleep.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.000]   And you'll notice that very close to the top of that list,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.360]   if not top of that list,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   is to get sunlight in your eyes early in the day.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.320]   You don't have to see the sun cross the horizon.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.460]   If you can, that's great.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.080]   But if you wake up after the sun has already risen,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.680]   go outside, face the sun,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.360]   blink as necessary to protect your eyes,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   but get some sunlight into your eyes every single day
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.200]   or as often as you possibly can,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.000]   especially on overcast days, okay?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.200]   That's an absolutely unequivocally science supported tool
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.460]   that will increase daytime mood focus and alertness
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.200]   and will improve your nighttime sleep.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.160]   Viewing morning sunlight
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.000]   also has profoundly positive effects on metabolism.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.440]   Now those effects on metabolism
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.840]   could be the direct effect of viewing sunlight
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.360]   or more likely they are the indirect consequence
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.160]   of getting better sleep at night.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.060]   So getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.560]   and ideally in the evening or late afternoon
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.040]   before the sun sets is a very well supported protocol
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.640]   that we know is beneficial for numerous aspects
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.160]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   And of course, sunlight and getting sunlight in one's eyes
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.680]   does require that you get outside.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.180]   You simply will not derive the same benefits
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.520]   from viewing sunlight
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.680]   if you try and do it through a window or windshield,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040]   or if you look at a picture of a sun on a screen,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800]   forget it, you are not going to set your circadian rhythm,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.200]   you are not going to derive
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.440]   all the positive effects of sunlight
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.980]   by trying to get it from screens
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.840]   or from looking at pictures of suns
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.240]   or something of that sort.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   Now, if you are somebody that for whatever reason,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.100]   seasonality, where you live on the planet,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.680]   work schedule, et cetera,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.720]   who cannot get sunlight in your eyes early in the day
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   on a consistent basis,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.000]   well then you might consider purchasing a so-called sad lamp
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   which is for seasonal affective disorder,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240]   which is very bright light
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.320]   that you can look at in the morning
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.080]   for usually about five to 10 minutes.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.200]   People will put it on their counter
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.320]   while they make their morning coffee, eat their breakfast,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.840]   and that has also been shown
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600]   to improve mood focus and alertness
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.040]   and set one circadian rhythm,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.840]   but it is not nearly as effective
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.120]   as getting sunlight in your eyes.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.600]   Now, why am I talking about this practice
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.100]   that I've already talked about extensively
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.400]   on numerous podcasts before?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.880]   Well, because the question is about nature
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.780]   and sunlight is a key feature of our natural environment.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.040]   But the person is also asking
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.280]   about other features of nature,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.340]   seeing green colors or blue colors
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.300]   or running streams for that matter.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.680]   Well, here too, we can ask
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.560]   what does the scientific data really say
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.580]   about things like going near a waterfall
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.240]   or a running stream or being near an ocean?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.680]   And actually this is quite interesting.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.880]   There is actually a peer-reviewed literature
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.980]   on negative ionization as it's called,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.640]   which is a pattern of ionization
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.760]   that's present close to bodies of water
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.080]   and particular types of bodies of water
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.420]   such as waterfalls, running streams, et cetera.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.400]   There's actually a laboratory
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.640]   at Columbia University School of Medicine
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.360]   that has published fairly extensively
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   on the health benefits of negative ionization
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.480]   as it relates to setting circadian rhythm
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.520]   and some other aspects of mental and physical health.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.480]   I intend to host the head of that laboratory
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.300]   on the Huberman Lab podcast in the not too distant future.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.260]   For now, we can safely say this.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.000]   There does seem to be some positive health benefits
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.360]   to placing oneself near bodies of water,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.100]   in particular, moving bodies of water.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.580]   And of course, as is always the case
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.800]   when there's a discovery
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.280]   about how the natural world can impact health,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.480]   there have been some technologies developed
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.740]   to create negative patterns of ionization
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.280]   within a home environment.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.200]   But as with viewing sunlight exposure
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.960]   and comparing it to say, sad lamps,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.920]   the negative ionization machines that one can purchase
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.180]   and put in their home environment
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.020]   have been shown in a few studies
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.040]   to produce some positive health benefits.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.800]   But those positive effects in no way
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.420]   reach the level of positive effects
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.140]   that have been demonstrated in studies
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.440]   where people are actually spending
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.560]   a dedicated period of time outdoors
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.440]   near a moving body of water.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.080]   So in thinking about nature, natural environments,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.800]   there's strong evidence for getting sunlight in one's eyes.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   There is some evidence
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.760]   for being near moving bodies of water, perhaps.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.280]   Again, I really want to highlight perhaps
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.180]   because of negative ionization
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.760]   created by those moving bodies of water.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.120]   There is far less evidence for sunlight simulators
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.400]   or negative ionization machines used indoors.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.840]   And then the asker of this question also, quite correctly,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.980]   asked about things like calming sounds,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.640]   watching wildlife, green colors, et cetera.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.720]   And herein lies a really important point
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.760]   for everyone to digest.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.520]   While, of course, answering a question
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.940]   about the natural world or about health
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.440]   requires that we first pose a hypothesis.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   For those of you that aren't familiar
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.680]   with what a hypothesis is,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.900]   a hypothesis is a stated prediction.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.800]   So it's not a question.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.840]   A question would be something like,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.280]   is getting out into nature good for our health?
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.920]   A scientific hypothesis is where
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.800]   one actually takes a stance.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.880]   For instance, you could take the stance
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.460]   and make the hypothesis that getting out into nature
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.380]   for 30 minutes per day, three days per week,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.080]   improves mood and nighttime sleep.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.720]   Okay, so that's a hypothesis
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   that then one would go on to design an experiment to test
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.160]   and then evaluate the data from that experiment
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   and compare it to the hypothesis,
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.840]   either validating or negating that hypothesis.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   That's essentially how science is done.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   There's a lot more to it,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.600]   but that's essentially the scientific method.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.560]   And while, of course, the scientific method
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.520]   is a fabulously powerful tool,
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.880]   for some questions, it is a less potent tool.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.640]   And the question of, is getting out into nature helpful
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.120]   for enhancing our mental and physical health,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.600]   is the sort of question that while, ideally,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.260]   you could design a really well-controlled study to address,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.680]   it's actually quite difficult to design such a study.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.740]   And here's why.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.480]   In order to perform a study that's very well-controlled,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.000]   meaning where you can isolate individual variables,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.720]   like sunlight, like the sorts of color contrast
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.260]   that one sees in the natural scene,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.620]   outdoors in a forest or near a river,
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.840]   in order to address whether or not the calming sounds
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   or the presence of squirrels
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.660]   running through your environment are the relevant factors,
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.620]   it becomes incredibly difficult
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.060]   to try and isolate individual variables.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.160]   Meaning as soon as you bring people into the laboratory,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.680]   yes, you have more control over which variables,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.400]   as they're called, you present them, right,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.660]   by bringing them into a room
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.820]   that essentially has no art on the walls
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.680]   and then having them look at a picture of a sun
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.040]   or looking at sunlight or listening to soothing sounds
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.000]   or looking at a picture of a forest,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.100]   of course, you're controlling the individual variables.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.140]   However, there is a sort of gestalt,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.500]   meaning a collective picture of being in nature
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.000]   that brings together lots of different elements, right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.500]   The element of surprise, for instance,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.440]   the other day I was out for a Sunday hike,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.240]   and that morning I saw a squirrel running across my path,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.380]   and it was interesting
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.240]   because the squirrel had a pine cone in its mouth,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.880]   it had been chewed down to the cob,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.640]   and the squirrel was probably only about
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.360]   seven or eight inches long,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   and the pine cone was probably about nine or 10 inches long,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   the cob of the pine cone, that is,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.520]   and the interesting thing is that the squirrel
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.280]   was carrying it long ways from the tip of the cob,
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.480]   and so I delighted in the fact
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.680]   that this little squirrel was working so hard
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720]   to carry this object through the woods,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   and this object was literally longer than its own body length
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.840]   and it looks so dedicated and it's running across the path
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.200]   in order to do whatever it would with that pine cone cob,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.260]   so something like that obviously stuck in my memory,
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.800]   it delighted me, and at the very same time,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.480]   there were a number of other things happening
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.200]   besides the presence of that novel wildlife experience,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.240]   there was the sound of a stream, there's the sunlight,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.400]   there's the color contrast everywhere,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.500]   I'm breathing fresh air because I was far away
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.820]   from any cars or any civilization, in fact,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.180]   and so here's what we know,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.120]   there are dozens, if not hundreds of studies that show
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.960]   that if people get out of doors into nature,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.440]   this could be parks, this could be near a stream,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.640]   this could be an ocean,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.840]   any number of different natural environments,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.780]   and if they do that for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes,
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.400]   three to seven days per week,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.600]   indeed, there are demonstrated significant reductions
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.880]   in things like blood pressure, resting heart rate,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   improvements in sleep, improvements in mood,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.080]   and so I think we can very reliably say that yes,
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.680]   or perhaps even absolutely yes,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   getting outside into nature can enhance various aspects
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.400]   of mental health, physical health,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.600]   and thereby performance in different aspects of life,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.440]   however, when talking about the benefits
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.840]   of getting into nature, we are talking about hundreds,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.880]   if not thousands of variables,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.640]   some of which we are aware of,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.800]   such as the presence of wildlife or sunlight
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.280]   or color contrast, and then of course,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.040]   there are going to be dozens, if not hundreds,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.500]   maybe even thousands of other variables
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.160]   that we're not even aware of,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160]   perhaps it's negative ionization,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.520]   most people aren't measuring the ionization of the air
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.040]   when they go out into nature,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.240]   but perhaps it's also the presence of certain smells
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.080]   from the soils that are being broken down,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.240]   and then they're changing the oxygenation state
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.120]   of the air around you, the plants, et cetera,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.880]   again, so many variables that frankly,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.160]   to try and isolate any one of those variables
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.800]   in the laboratory seems not just artificial,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.680]   but I think that it actually would just lead
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.960]   to a diminished sense of just how valuable nature is,
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.080]   so while of course, the Huberman Lab podcast is a podcast
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.880]   where we always center on science
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.960]   and science-related tools,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.800]   meaning protocols that are grounded
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.840]   in quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.680]   that have been subjected to control conditions
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.880]   where some people are getting, say, the drug treatment
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.960]   or taking the supplement
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.080]   or doing a particular behavioral practice
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.260]   and other people are not, or doing some variant of those
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.540]   and dose response curves, all of that stuff,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.040]   when it comes to the question of whether or not
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.200]   it's valuable to get out into nature,
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.920]   I think it's a very straightforward yes, absolutely yes,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.880]   get out into nature as often as you can
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.200]   and safely can, of course,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.120]   I realize some of this is weather permitting,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   people live in different areas, some people are in cities,
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.280]   some people are in deserts, some people are near the ocean,
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.360]   but getting out into nature has been shown
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.920]   over and over again
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.200]   to have numerous positive health effects,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.480]   and yet, unless we're talking about sunlight exposure
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.240]   and isolating the variable of setting one's circadian rhythm
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.640]   by viewing sunlight early in the day,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.240]   all of the other features of getting out into nature,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.320]   things like forest bathing,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.180]   this is a term coined from some, frankly,
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.560]   pretty nice studies that were done in Japan
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.280]   in which people placed themselves
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.140]   into forest-like environments for a certain period of time,
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.260]   there were control groups
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.140]   where people were not placed into those environments,
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.700]   and the people that did this so-called forest bathing
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.920]   experienced enhanced mental and physical health
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.800]   that brought on a practice of people
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.520]   who could not get out of doors into forests,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.700]   bringing plants into their home environment,
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.160]   which I think all of us would agree look nice,
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.360]   they often will add pleasant odors to the air,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.260]   and perhaps they do actually shift our mental
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.000]   and physical health in significant ways,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.920]   I suppose it depends on how much you like plants,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   how much you pay attention to them,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.080]   and of course, how many plants there are,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.920]   but, and I think this is a really important but
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.680]   to emphasize,
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.600]   while most all questions about tools and protocols
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.260]   for enhancing health
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.640]   immediately lead me to say,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.960]   "Ah, this study or that study,"
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.700]   or, "Yes, there's evidence," or, "No, there isn't evidence,"
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.340]   when it comes to questions about nature
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.180]   and grounding in particular,
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.460]   I take the stance that this is a unique instance
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.140]   where we know there are just so many benefits
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.260]   of getting out into nature
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.920]   that trying to isolate any one of those variables
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.500]   in a quality, rigorous way within the laboratory
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.000]   almost seems too artificial
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   to really justify the conclusions that arrive.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.500]   Now, I'm sure there are some of you out there
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.660]   who are aware, and if you're not, I'll tell you,
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.340]   there are studies that have explored this practice
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.560]   of so-called grounding.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.960]   They've had people come into the laboratory
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.000]   and place their feet on soil
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.640]   that is contained within a box,
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   or there are other studies
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.260]   where they actually have people go out of doors
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.560]   and place their feet onto the grass or the ground,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   and there are a bunch of theories
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.620]   as to how grounding could improve one's mental
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.380]   and physical health that aren't just about getting outside,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.760]   so the theories go that this has to do
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.980]   with the exchange of electrons
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.920]   with the earth and the earth's surface in particular.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.180]   There's been the argument made that shoes,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.000]   in particular shoes that have rubber soles,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.420]   may block some of this electron exchange
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.240]   with the surface of the earth.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.860]   There have been theories about the tactile,
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.060]   that is the touch sensation with the earth being important.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.420]   Not a lot of science published
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.220]   in let's just say blue ribbon journals,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.060]   which is not to diminish some of the journals
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.380]   that these have been published in,
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.960]   but just to say that, again,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.540]   there are so many variables associated with a practice
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.520]   such as grounding that I'll simply say,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.880]   "Yes, please do get out of doors into nature."
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.560]   I try every Sunday to do my zone two cardio
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.080]   by rucking or jogging or hiking, often with other people,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.980]   if I'm trying to be social with family or others,
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.020]   but the point is getting out of doors
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.400]   has myriad positive effects on mental health
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.240]   and physical health,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.600]   and of course, when you're moving out of doors,
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.000]   you're also getting that zone two cardio
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.660]   or other forms of physical benefit
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.840]   by elevating your heart rate,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.660]   or perhaps you could even do your resistance training
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.940]   out of doors on other days.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.560]   Now, I also try to get out of doors other days of the week,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.240]   but oftentimes I'm by way of weather
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.380]   or by way of other commitments
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.080]   forced to be indoors on planes here at the podcast studio
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.720]   where certainly I'm indoors,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.320]   but I try and get out of doors
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.700]   at least a few minutes each day for a morning stroll,
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.460]   looking at sunlight, et cetera.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.340]   So the long and short of this is,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.160]   yes, there's some evidence for grounding.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.580]   Is it super strong evidence?
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.620]   No, it's not.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.500]   We don't really know what it is
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.840]   about placing one's feet onto the earth.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.460]   That is producing the positive effects
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.700]   that were observed in those studies.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.900]   And those studies made some reasonable attempt
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.140]   to isolate the variables
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.480]   and figure out whether or not it was ion exchange
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.680]   with the earth or the tactile,
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.780]   meaning the touch sensation
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.540]   of having one's feet on the ground.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.540]   Frankly, I don't think there's enough quality science
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.220]   to really draw any firm conclusions about that.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.980]   However, if you like the idea of grounding,
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.940]   by all means do it.
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.180]   In fact, if it feels good to you,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.620]   I recommend getting your morning sunlight out of doors
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.520]   with your bare feet on the ground.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.860]   Or if you're like me, you know,
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.700]   you put on your shoes and you take a walk most days,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.640]   although I've tried this practice of grounding
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.620]   and it feels pretty good,
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.280]   meaning it feels nice to have my feet on the earth
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.680]   provided I'm on clean soil or clean lawn.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   Definitely don't do this at the dog park.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.320]   Hookworm is a real thing, by the way, folks.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.200]   So pay attention to the sorts of surfaces
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.820]   that you're putting your feet onto.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.600]   But the question about whether or not nature is valuable
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   for our mental and physical health is an easy one.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.780]   It's an absolute yes.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.660]   But isolating the particular variables about nature
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.020]   that are most beneficial,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.140]   well, that's a much tougher question.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.980]   It's one that frankly, the scientific method is not.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.200]   And to be honest, I don't think ever we'll be in a position
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.980]   to isolate and really nail down specifically
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.860]   because as soon as you get specific about that question,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.140]   you start to diminish the value of the study itself.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.300]   So the long and short of this is get out into nature
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.260]   as often as you safely can.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.660]   If you can exercise out of doors, even better.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.140]   If you want to make it social, great.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.220]   If you don't want to make it social, fine.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.680]   It's your life, it's up to you.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.700]   But there certainly is value in getting out into nature.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.460]   It's also just beautiful from a visual perspective,
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.300]   from an auditory perspective.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.380]   And I myself try and take at least a few trips each year.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.020]   None of these are particularly expensive trips
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.400]   where I try and get out hiking, camping.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.480]   The weekly walks in nature are an absolute must for me.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.600]   If I miss one because of weather conditions or travel,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.540]   I make it a point to try and get into nature more
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.040]   during the following week or whenever I can.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.340]   And frankly, I don't have a scientific explanation
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.300]   for why nature is oh so beneficial,
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.700]   except for the sunlight piece and perhaps this grounding
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.740]   piece and the negative ionization piece.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.280]   And frankly, I don't worry so much about the lack
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.580]   of variable isolating quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.220]   that support the benefits of getting out into nature.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.960]   I simply like getting out into nature
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.660]   and into different natural environments
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.000]   as much as I possibly can, because for whatever reason,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.580]   imagine those reasons have something to do with serotonin,
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.460]   dopamine, hormones, oxytocin,
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.880]   probably a bunch of different things that are rooted
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.100]   in how our nervous system evolved in natural environments.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.760]   Well, it just feels really good.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.340]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.260]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.660]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.260]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.300]   plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.760]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast standard channel
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.740]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.880]   please go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.100]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.300]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.160]   it's really twofold.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.080]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.560]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.840]   which of course will still be continued
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.700]   We are not going to change the format
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.280]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.900]   And to fund research, in particular research done
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.820]   on human beings, so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.620]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.820]   that we are most interested in.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.440]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.480]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.380]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.800]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.640]   but through all channels,
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.820]   Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.380]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.580]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.760]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.500]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   in the first place.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.840]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.800]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.580]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.080]   for research through the premium channel.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.680]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.660]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.720]   to further support research for science
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.500]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.020]   physical health, and performance.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.860]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.620]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.680]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.440]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.780]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.680]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.260]   And you'll of course get answers to all the questions
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.640]   that other people ask as well.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.580]   There will also be some premium content
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.380]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.300]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.540]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.860]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.200]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.620]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.300]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.180]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.100]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.040]   (upbeat music)
