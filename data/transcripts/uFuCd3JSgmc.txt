[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.160]   Hi, Kaljien here.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.440]   A follow-up question to your semester plans,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.880]   a fellow academic here as well.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.680]   How do you factor in teaching in your semester plans?
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240]   So I get the research component, but how
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.960]   do you factor in teaching in your semester strategic plans,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.040]   that is prep and everything else?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.480]   And then how do you factor in your personal semester goals
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440]   or strategic goals, however you may want to call them,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.760]   in the semester plans?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.440]   So looking forward to hearing from you,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.680]   and thank you so much for all you do.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.360]   As I said, following you for the last many, many years,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.040]   so appreciate it.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.240]   Looking forward to hearing your take on incorporating
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.000]   all the wheels of academia into the strategic plans.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.120]   Thank you.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.800]   Well, when it comes to my plan for the upcoming semester,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   I start with teaching.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.640]   That's my starting point, because obviously,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.480]   the teaching is something that has to happen,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.760]   and it has to happen at a consistently high level.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400]   Now, the good news about teaching
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   is that after you've taught a class a few times,
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   the work that's required becomes quite predictable.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.480]   So you know what you're in for.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.080]   It doesn't have the same uncertainty
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   that research does, where you don't know,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.280]   is this going to work or not?
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.120]   Are you going to come across a topic that's interesting?
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.240]   Is it going to take a ton of time?
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.000]   Are you going to have a quick breakthrough?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.320]   That can be really hard to predict and plan.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.680]   Teaching, you know.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.960]   Taught this class twice before.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.680]   I know what's involved.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.080]   So my approach typically is to automate everything.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.400]   I'm using the word automate here in an idiosyncratic way
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.160]   that's unique to the way I talk about work and productivity.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.200]   I don't mean automate in the traditional way
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.360]   of some other system will do this for you,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   like automatically.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.520]   When I use the term automate,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.600]   I'm actually using a version of this term
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.560]   I introduced in my book, "A World Without Email."
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.040]   What I mean by that is you automate the thinking
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   and scheduling process around the work.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   You don't have to make a decision each week or each day
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.880]   about what am I going to do next?
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.720]   You figure out when the work happens,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240]   how it happens, and where it's going to happen.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.400]   So the stuff you know predictably
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600]   goes into supporting this class.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   You figure out a system for that.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.560]   This is when and where it happens every single week.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   The scheduling itself has become automated.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.920]   That's in the foundation of my schedule for the semester.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.960]   So now I know when this work's going to happen.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280]   It's on my calendar for the entire semester.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.440]   Now I work around everything else.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.040]   So that becomes the can't be compromised on anchor
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.960]   of my schedule.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   And I know exactly where and when that work happens.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.360]   And then I figure out what am I going to do with what's left.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.040]   So for example, I'm working right now
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.520]   on figuring out my semester plan
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   for the upcoming spring semester at Georgetown.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.600]   I'm teaching two courses.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.280]   And the way those courses are arranged,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.840]   which I feel good about,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.280]   and doesn't always work out this way,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.440]   but I think it's going to work quite well,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520]   is they're on the same days, Monday and Wednesday.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   And so I have one course that's at 11
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.120]   and another course is at 3.30.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.040]   And that's the same on Monday and on Wednesday.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   So now I'm starting to work through,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.400]   okay, how's this going to work?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.440]   Prep is going to happen in the morning
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.720]   before I leave for campus.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.160]   I have that pretty much dialed in.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440]   I'm teaching a course right now at 11.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.200]   So it's a good amount of time to do prep.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440]   One of the courses I'm teaching right now in the fall,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.200]   and it's been heavily prepped very well.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.440]   And I put a lot of effort this fall
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.280]   into updating all my notes so that when I get to the spring,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.960]   I don't really have to do new prep for that course.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   The prep time in the morning
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880]   can go towards the second course.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.520]   I'm going to use the time in between those two courses.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.960]   I get lunch and I'm going to use all the time.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.880]   That'll put me at one o'clock to 3.30, two and a half hours.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.680]   That is going to be me in the office, right?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   Me in the office, academic time.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.120]   So I'll probably open up that whole time
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520]   to be office hours in my plans.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.080]   So I have two classes full of students.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.280]   There's a lot of access they need.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.240]   So I'm just going to basically say,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.400]   hey, one to 3.20,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.040]   come by my office on Monday or Wednesdays.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.880]   I'm always going to be there.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.160]   That's when I'm going to be working on things.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.120]   This is where I'm going,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   that window is where I'm going to schedule
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.480]   any of the other work related to these courses.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.000]   So I've already figured out TA situations,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   who my TAs are going to be,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.720]   the process with which those TAs are going to work.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.600]   They're going to come to my, I'm figuring this all out.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.520]   They're going to come to my office
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.920]   when we have a new problem set due for us to talk it over.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   That time comes out of that window.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   When it comes time to going through and checking grading,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.720]   that's going to show up on my calendar during that window
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.000]   between the two courses.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.920]   I mean, I'm really working out the whole thing.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.240]   So that basically for me, for this particular semester,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.880]   Monday and Wednesdays is all teaching
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   and everything fits into there.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.840]   Everything related to teaching fits into there just right.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.200]   Tuesday, Thursday, Friday is not at all teaching.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.320]   That's what I mean by automation.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   I'm making a plan.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.400]   So I have time for everything I need
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.920]   to teach these courses well.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.480]   And I know exactly where that time lands
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.640]   and I've configured it in a way
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.280]   that its footprint is reasonable.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.360]   And then I'll move on and say, okay,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   what am I going to do with these other three days?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.120]   Where am I going to do research?
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.240]   What about other meetings, like committee meetings?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.320]   And I have a theory I'm putting together here
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.880]   where those are going to all happen after 2 p.m.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   And so the mornings are going to be just
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.360]   for research or writing.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.440]   I'm trying to figure this all out,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.680]   but that's what it looks like.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.520]   That's what it looks like when I do that thinking.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.480]   So that's what I'd recommend to you,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.440]   but it's also what I would recommend more broadly
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.800]   outside of academia.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.040]   Take the work that is non-negotiable.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.160]   This is a part of my job that has to happen.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.000]   It always has to happen, but it's predictable.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120]   And automate, automate, automate.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.640]   This is when and how I do it.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.600]   I don't want to have to think about it.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.400]   I don't want to have to say, oh, should I prep today?
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.440]   Should I prep right now?
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.560]   Should I prep this afternoon?
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.600]   Should I meet with my TAs?
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.440]   When should I do that?
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.280]   I guess I should do that soon.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.920]   The stuff you know that's going to happen,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.320]   figure out when it's going to happen,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.160]   get it on your calendar,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.560]   and then forget about having to worry about it.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.640]   When you get there, you get there.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.240]   It'll get executed when it gets executed.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   That's the right way, I think,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.600]   to most effectively deal with stuff
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.760]   that has to happen again and again.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.980]   (upbeat music)
