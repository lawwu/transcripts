[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   You say there hasn't been fraud on a scale like Enron up until perhaps FTX,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.920]   but you're forgetting the global financial crisis.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.900]   And in the end, the line between what happened at Enron and, and, and what
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.920]   happened in the global financial crisis, it's not a matter of black and white.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.880]   It's not a matter of one thing was clear cut fraud and one thing.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.560]   Great.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.840]   We love these practices.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.920]   Isn't this fantastic?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.760]   This is the way we want business to operate.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.020]   They're both somewhere in the murky middle.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.640]   You know, a lot of what happened at Enron wasn't actually outright fraud.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.320]   I coined this phrase legal fraud to describe, um, to describe what it is
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.240]   that, that, that, that happened at Enron.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.860]   And a lot of what happened in the global financial crisis was legal,
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.640]   hence the lack of prosecutions.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.880]   But it's also not behavior that, that leads to a healthy market or for
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.320]   that matter, a healthy society.
