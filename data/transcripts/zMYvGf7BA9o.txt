[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   So she's like, "What is going on?"
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.600]   So we have this conversation and I tell her,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.360]   "Look, people are looking for me."
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.200]   Who?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.020]   Law enforcement.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.860]   Which ones?
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.040]   All of them.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.860]   She's like, "That doesn't even, for what?"
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.740]   I go, "Mostly bank fraud."
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.760]   And she's like, "Well, how are they not finding you?"
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.160]   I mean, everybody, people know you,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.040]   like your general contractor,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   which I met four months before.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.840]   This guy six months before, this one two months before.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.060]   She's like, "So-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so."
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.720]   And I'm like, "Right, right, well."
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.080]   I said, "Well," she's like, "I mean, they've got your name.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.520]   "They've got your," I go, "Well, that's identity theft."
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760]   And she was like, "What do you mean?"
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.360]   I said, "Well, my name's not,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.640]   "my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter."
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120]   "What is your name?"
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.980]   I go, "Look, you know, you don't even worry about it."
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.820]   - The following is a conversation with Matthew Cox,
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.500]   a con man recently released from federal prison
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.660]   where he served 13 years for bank fraud, mortgage fraud,
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.140]   identity theft, passport fraud, and other charges.
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.980]   He has admitted guilt to all of it.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.420]   He has written true crime stories
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.140]   of many of his fellow prisoners,
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.260]   and now he continues this work
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.940]   by interviewing criminals about their crimes
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.320]   on his YouTube channel that I recommend
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560]   called Inside True Crime.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.540]   Exploring the mind of a criminal
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.820]   is exploring human nature at the extremes,
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.680]   often in its most raw and illuminating form.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   And that is something I definitely want to do
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.400]   with this podcast, to understand the human mind
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.680]   and everything it is capable of.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.800]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.940]   in the description.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Matthew Cox.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.060]   What was the first crime you committed?
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.820]   - The first mortgage I ever did.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.900]   - A mortgage is me borrowing money
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.540]   from a bank to buy a house.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.380]   How can you find a way to commit crime in this?
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.660]   How can you do fraud in this space?
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.820]   - It's very difficult for the average guy to commit fraud
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.100]   because there's so many safeguards set up.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.140]   If you were to go in and say,
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.660]   "I make $300,000 a year."
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.100]   Okay, well, we want your W-2s, we want your paystubs,
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.060]   we're gonna call your employer,
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.500]   we're gonna check to make sure your employer,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.760]   how long they've been incorporated,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.740]   we're gonna check to make sure they're registered.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.060]   It's like, ugh, your whole plan fell apart
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.260]   because the average guy can't do that.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.900]   He can't even come up with the paystub and W-2.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.620]   So the average person, or I'm gonna put down
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.580]   this much money, but you're gonna borrow that money
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.980]   from the seller, you know?
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.180]   Okay, well, then they start asking for bank statements.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.100]   Where did the money come from?
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.460]   How long has it been in your bank?
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.140]   Like, you can't even have it put in your bank for a day,
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.500]   get a letter, you know, it's gotta have been there
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.460]   for 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.900]   And so there's all these ways for the average person.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.620]   It's very difficult to commit fraud.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.820]   The average guy that works at Walmart
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.100]   and makes $60,000 a year and he's been there for five years
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.980]   and he saved his deposit, like, it's a very,
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.020]   that's really the guy that those transactions
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.100]   are set up for.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.580]   To borrow a mortgage from Bank of America,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.220]   that's the guy they're looking for.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.180]   - So to commit fraud in this space,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.220]   you have to misrepresent some aspect of your identity,
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.860]   of how much you're worth, how much money you have,
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.700]   this kind of stuff?
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.100]   - Right, you have to be able to lie to the bank.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.500]   Anytime you lie to the bank, you've committed fraud.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.460]   And it's funny, when I was doing it,
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.380]   I would say, ah, it's in the gray area.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.740]   There's no gray area where you're either lying
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.800]   in some capacity or you're not.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.100]   So, for instance, the very first loan I did,
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100]   I whited out my borrower, had been 30 days late on her rent.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:05.220]   So they're really looking at the last two years.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.060]   So when you go in the bank and most of what they're asking
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.820]   is a two-year window.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.900]   They're saying, how long have you been on their job?
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   They care about two years.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.340]   And how long have you been at your residency?
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.680]   They're looking for two years.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now, you could be at three places in two years, that's fine,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   as long as you consistently paid for two years.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.320]   Well, she had been in an apartment complex,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.940]   but she'd been 30 days late.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.240]   Now, she caught it up, but she was late.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.000]   The bank doesn't want to lend you money
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   if you've been 30 days late.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   So I was a broker and I whited out the 30-day late.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.980]   I just got rid of it.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.440]   And my manager is the person that told me to do it.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   She said, it'll be fine.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.120]   And she was right, it was.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.000]   - What did it feel like?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.880]   So that was the first fraudulent action you committed.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   - Yeah, I mean, I was worried.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   I always say, I sweated bullets for four or five days.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.960]   But I mean, I was concerned.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.160]   And I don't know that I was concerned
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.240]   that I had broken the law.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   I was concerned because I was behind on my truck payment.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.760]   I was behind on my mortgage.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.600]   I had banked on being a mortgage broker
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.640]   and I'd gone deep, deep behind on all my bills to do this.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.760]   So at the last minute when this loan isn't gonna close
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.800]   and I have to commit fraud to make that happen.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.300]   And the idea, my fear was they were gonna figure it out
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.500]   and maybe I'd get fired.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.760]   I didn't think I was gonna go to jail
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.720]   because my manager assured me, you're not going to jail.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.940]   You'll get fired at best.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.740]   So my concern was they were gonna catch it
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.080]   and I'd get fired and I wouldn't get paid.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   Like I needed that money so bad.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.840]   - So we'll maybe paint the picture here.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   Where were you working?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   Who was the manager?
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.520]   - The manager, what is funny,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.580]   'cause I don't think I ever really mentioned this.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.640]   Her name was Gretchen Zayas.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.240]   She eventually, I don't mind saying it,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.560]   but she eventually ended up going to jail for fraud.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.360]   Her name was Gretchen Zayas and she was the manager.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.020]   I was working for a company called Eagle Lending
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.820]   and it was in Tampa and this was like my first month.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.900]   So my very first deal, three or four weeks into it,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.740]   into that first month and I walk in,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.420]   I put the file in front of my manager.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.300]   She looks through everything.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.620]   Oh, great, good, good.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.380]   And put this one piece of paper over here and sat there.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.720]   And then when she was done, I said, "What's going on?"
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.340]   She goes, "Perfect, file's perfect."
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.700]   She goes, "But your borrower's 30 days late on her rent."
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.540]   And she says, "It's done."
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.220]   She's like, "That's a deal killer."
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.140]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, what do I do?"
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.900]   And I remember she pulled out a thing, a whiteout.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.740]   Remember the whiteout?
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.100]   Not the sticks, but the one, shh, shh, shh.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.580]   And she started going, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.700]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.740]   She goes, "If I was you."
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.020]   And she handed, she said, "I'd white it out,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.460]   "make a copy, stick it back in the file."
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.900]   She said, "It'll be fine."
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.940]   And I went, I was like, "That's fraud.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.780]   "I could go to jail."
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.520]   And she goes, and she was like,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.780]   "They're never gonna catch it."
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.860]   She said, "Look, we do stuff, I do stuff all the time."
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.380]   She said, "They're not gonna catch it."
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.820]   And nobody's calling the FBI.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.820]   She goes, "Worst case scenario,
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   "if underwriting catches it, then they'll fire you.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.660]   "That's it, nobody's calling, you're not going to jail."
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.100]   And I was, you know, I trusted her.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.780]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.660]   And so I did what she said, I stuck it in the file.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.900]   And I mean, like I said, for four or five days,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.820]   I was like, "Oh my God, I'm so scared."
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.780]   - How old were you at this point?
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.140]   - Probably 29, I think it was 29.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.740]   You know, like I had gone to college
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.960]   and so many things had not worked out.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.660]   You know, I got a degree in fine arts.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.780]   It's not, there's not a lot of people looking
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.860]   for anyone with a fine arts degree.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.860]   And, you know, I tried to be an insurance adjuster.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.660]   Tried that for about a year, year and a half.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.740]   That didn't work out.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.620]   Ended up working construction for a few years.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.120]   And, you know, so finally, the girl I was dating said,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   "You gotta be a mortgage broker."
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.220]   You know, she had just started as a mortgage,
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.540]   in the mortgage industry.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.640]   And she was like, "You have to do this.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.620]   "Like you were born to do this.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.340]   "This is perfect for you."
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.740]   - What did she see in you?
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.500]   - She said, "You're a salesman."
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.940]   And I was like, 'cause I was like,
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.700]   you know, I barely balanced my checkbook.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.180]   Like, I don't know anything about numbers.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.060]   She was like, "It has nothing to do with that.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.720]   "It's sales, it's putting together deals.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.580]   "You know, you're good at that.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.740]   "You're good at negotiating.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.860]   "You're a natural sales salesman."
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.500]   And I figured I needed to try something.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   - So what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making?
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.420]   What aspects require the charisma that you clearly have?
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.420]   - Well, one, you have clients that have lots of options.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.380]   They can go to Bank of America.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.740]   They can go to SunTrust.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.400]   They can go to Chase.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.700]   They have options, if they have perfect credit.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.940]   I ended up working for a company
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.780]   that was a subprime lender.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.620]   And those people didn't have a lot of options.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.900]   But honestly, by the time they got to that,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.620]   to Eagle Lending, their options were over.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.660]   So what ends up happening is you're negotiating with sellers.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.660]   You would think that a lot of the stuff
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   that in that industry that real estate agents should do,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.900]   the brokers end up doing.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.000]   Because real estate agents are used to,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.060]   you meet 'em at the house,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.620]   or they take you to several houses.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.340]   They open the door, they walk around.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.320]   They write up a contract that's legit, a legit contract.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.780]   And you're already pre-approved.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.740]   Everything works out.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.980]   But subprime, that's not the case.
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.500]   You got borrowers with horrific job history.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   They don't have enough of the down payment.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.960]   They can't, maybe they have the down payment,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.220]   but they don't have the closing costs.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.220]   So you have to go to the real estate agent and say,
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.700]   "Listen, I need you to raise the purchase price
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.060]   "and have the seller pay the closing costs."
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.420]   Which is legal, but that's not, to a degree.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.680]   But that's not how they wrote up the contract.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.240]   So now you're having to get them to rewrite the contract.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.160]   Or there's little things you're trying to do.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.160]   And the more deals you get done,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.320]   and the more you deal with certain real estate agents,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.960]   the more you start to realize that they're,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.560]   you know which ones are completely above board
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.060]   and which ones are willing to twist the rules.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.120]   - And a lot of it works on personal relationships.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.960]   - Right, right.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   For some reason, people tend to like me and trust me.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.040]   - Yeah.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   - I don't know why it hasn't worked out for so many people,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.600]   but people naturally seem to trust me.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.780]   And so if I say, "Hey, I can close the loan,
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.020]   "but you gotta do this, it'll be cool.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.280]   "Don't worry, we do it all the time.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.820]   "It's like my third loan."
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.640]   And you know, I've been doing this for years,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.200]   and they go, "Oh, okay."
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.680]   And then they raise the purchase price, they add some money.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.920]   They have the seller of the house give the borrower
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   some money, they stick it in the bank,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   or they put it in an escrow at the closing company.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.200]   Like now you're starting to massage deals.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.040]   - What was the second time you committed a crime?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.400]   So how did it start to evolve from the whiteout?
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.480]   - Well, I mean, when that went through,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.320]   you know, I think a normal person probably would have said,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.940]   "Wow, it was a one-time thing.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.760]   "Got away with it, whew, I'm good."
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.640]   But for me, it just emboldened me.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.140]   Like I just got a check for like,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.400]   I don't know what it was, $2,500, $3,500.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.560]   I was thrilled.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.520]   And by that time, I was already working on another deal.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.160]   But that guy, he made, I forget, something like,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.200]   he'd made like, let's say $45,000
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.680]   the year before in his W-2.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.800]   If you, based on his current track record,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.240]   or his year-to-date of his pay stub,
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.200]   he made just enough money.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   But if you factored in last year's W-2, he was shy.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.260]   So if I change that 45,000 to 51,000,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.960]   then he could, the loan closes.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.340]   I get a check for 3,500 bucks, he gets into a house,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.140]   I'm doing him a favor, you know, I'm doing God's work.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:45.140]   So I fix it, I kick back, I'm terrified a little bit,
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.060]   you know, worried about it.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.100]   Sure enough, it closes.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.580]   Four or five days later, they call me,
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.520]   he's ready to close.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   A week later, we close, I get a check.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.900]   Next guy that comes in, I mean, I got very, very quickly,
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.080]   I was concerned, do you have a house?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.920]   Do you have a deal?
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.740]   Is it ready?
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.280]   I can get you done.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.640]   Now, if you were in bankruptcy or something,
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.320]   there's some things you just, you'd pull their credit
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.040]   and you just couldn't help them if they were,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.980]   if they had a 550 credit score or something and no job.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.080]   I mean, you know, they had to be within reason.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.240]   But very quickly, it was changing W-2s,
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.420]   changing pay subs, changing appraisals,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.860]   you know, fixing, like I said, verification of the rent.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.200]   So it evolved very quickly for me.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.820]   - And you're essentially helping people.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.540]   - That's what I told myself.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.580]   - Giving 'em a chance.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.460]   People that have been really struggling financially in life.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.440]   So you've been telling yourself that this is,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.100]   you're doing a good thing for people.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.220]   - I told myself that right up until,
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.160]   that those loans were solid
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.500]   and I was helping those people out,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.660]   right up until I went to prison.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.060]   And I was in prison and I had to write,
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.300]   the government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.120]   for, to help teach the nation's mortgage brokers.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.620]   You know, all loan officers and brokers have to take,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.920]   I think it's nine hours of continuing education
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.460]   every single year.
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.140]   And I was approached to write the ethics course.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.460]   And it was about that time
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.940]   and about the same period of time
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.780]   I was writing a book, my book.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:28.820]   And that kind of, I started reflecting on what I had done.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.460]   You know, and the truth is like,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.940]   and this is a horrible thing to say,
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.260]   'cause the first time I ever heard somebody say this,
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.940]   I remember thinking, oh, that's a horrible thing to say.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.260]   Some people should not own a house.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.220]   They shouldn't be allowed to borrow.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.940]   They're not in a position financially, you know,
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.020]   and there were many occasions
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.060]   where I put someone in a house
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.980]   that they 100% swore they could afford.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.220]   It was, I was helping them.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.860]   I told myself I was helping them.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.260]   And a year and a half later, they're going into foreclosure.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.940]   Their stuff's on the corner.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.340]   They don't know where to go.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.900]   And the truth is, is that I'm not smarter
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.260]   than the actuaries that came up
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   with those underwriting guidelines.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.100]   - So in this whole process, how are you making money?
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.100]   Are you taking a percentage? - Broker fee.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.420]   Yeah, I charge a broker fee.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.100]   Or you charge yield spread.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.260]   So yield spread is,
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.700]   let's say the interest rate is 8% interest.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.740]   If I charge them 25 basis points over the 8%,
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.140]   so I charge them 8 1/4, you know, 8.25,
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.900]   then I get 1% of the loan back as a fee.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.900]   So if I charge them 8 1/2%, I get two points back.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.180]   So if it's $100,000 piece of property
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.540]   and the bank says your interest rate is gonna be 8%
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   and I tell you 8.5 and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker fee,
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.320]   now I'm making $5,500.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.480]   So on even a $100,000 loan,
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.380]   you could make a nice chunk of change.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.980]   I mean, it's--
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.900]   - So how much gray area is here?
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.140]   You said that there really isn't when you're lying or not,
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.780]   but it feels like there is.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.060]   - Well, every time I change something, it wasn't gray area.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.100]   I just committed fraud.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.700]   At this level, you either meet the guidelines
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.700]   or someone has massaged it in such a way
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.140]   that they've committed fraud.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.980]   That's it.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.220]   There's tons of ways where you can commit fraud
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.660]   and they just can't figure it out.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.500]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.060]   Like, I mean, you've committed fraud
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.260]   and it's like they look at the entire,
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.620]   they look at all the documents
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.020]   and they double-check everything
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.260]   and they know there's fraud in here,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.420]   they just can't find it.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.980]   - Just because they can't find it doesn't mean it's not--
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.340]   - Doesn't mean it wasn't, exactly.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.820]   Doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.980]   - As part of this, you did a lot of fascinating things.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.180]   One of the things you did,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.060]   you talked about creating synthetic people,
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.220]   meaning creating fake identities.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.220]   What does it take to do that, to do that well?
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.940]   - So, your credit profile is made up of your,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.060]   your name, date of birth, your address,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.460]   and your social security number.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.660]   And those are the kind of,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.580]   and then there's other things, where you work,
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.540]   that sort of thing.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.180]   But what people don't realize is
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.980]   there's so many people out there that think
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.820]   that the credit bureaus already know who you are, right?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.620]   But the truth is, the first time the credit bureau
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.460]   has ever heard about you was when you told them.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.580]   The first time you applied for a credit card,
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.700]   you, they created a credit profile at that moment.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.180]   Prior to that, they had no idea.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.100]   So the first time you apply, you give them your full name,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.780]   date of birth, social security number, and your address.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.300]   And they create a credit profile,
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.380]   and they say, hey, no record found of this person.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.300]   He has no credit, nothing, probably got denied.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   Well, what I realized through the course of,
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.540]   'cause eventually I end up leaving that one company,
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.300]   and I open my own mortgage company.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.620]   When I opened that mortgage company,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.500]   I was on the inside.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.340]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.740]   Like I wasn't just a broker that was sitting out
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.100]   with everybody else and would periodically come in
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.540]   and ask questions, or would call underwriting,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.340]   but really didn't understand what was happening,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.180]   and exactly what the underwriting guidelines were.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.420]   Now I was actually talking to the underwriters,
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.300]   and you're talking to the owners
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.340]   of the lending institutions, and the banks,
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.700]   and you're talking to all of the account executives.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.900]   And now it wasn't just Eagle Lending I was talking to.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.980]   There were 40 different account executives
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.820]   coming in on a weekly basis,
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.020]   trying to get us to sign up with their lender.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.940]   And they're on the inside, telling you,
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.820]   coming in, showing you programs, and saying,
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.540]   look, if your borrower is self-employed,
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.540]   we don't ask for this or this.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.500]   We just ask for them to say they're self-employed,
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.660]   like liar loans.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.260]   You've heard the term liar loans?
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.820]   Okay.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.100]   No-doc loans, where they don't ask for any documentation.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.260]   If he's got over, let's say, a 700 credit score,
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.780]   and he says he's been a plumber, and he works for himself,
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.020]   then he's got over a 700 credit score.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.460]   He just has to say he's worked for himself
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.900]   for over two years, and--
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.740]   - They don't ask any information.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.340]   - They don't ask for any documentation.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.420]   He's got the money in the bank.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.780]   He's got a 700 credit score.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.660]   Says he's been on the job for two years.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.700]   He's self-employed.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.940]   We're gonna raise his interest rate by 1%,
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.700]   and he's got, that's it.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.820]   He's got the loan.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.700]   But you start to know how things work,
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.860]   because I hired a bunch of brokers to work underneath me,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.160]   and when they would get caught, I would get the phone call.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.980]   So I get the phone call from the owner of a bank
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.580]   or a lending institute, a lender,
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.820]   and that lender says, hey, Matt, we got a problem.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.660]   I'm like, what's up?
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.460]   He's like, listen, we caught a fake W-2.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.200]   I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.080]   Yeah, your broker, so-and-so, sent us a file,
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.500]   and this person had, there's two fake W-2s,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.420]   and we're assuming the pay subs are fake.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.380]   And I'm like, are you serious?
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.100]   How did you even catch that?
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.380]   And they go, oh, well, here's what we did.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.380]   We checked with sunbiz.com, you know, sunbiz.gov,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.100]   which is the Secretary of State's website
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.700]   that registers corporations,
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.820]   and we checked, and the tax ID number didn't match.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.820]   And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.340]   for whatever corporation issued it.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.920]   - So there's a sequence of checks they do
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.740]   to detect fraud on different documents, like W-2s.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.580]   - Right.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.860]   - And then you're slowly learning.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.900]   - Slowly, yeah, exactly.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.180]   - What's the process for detecting fraud?
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.460]   - I mean, I had a pretty good understanding anyway.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.300]   - Yeah.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.140]   - But so I'm starting to learn that.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.300]   - It's common sense understanding, yeah.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.220]   - So I'm putting these things together,
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.620]   and I remember one time I had a woman come in,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.500]   and she came in, and she had perfect credit.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.560]   She had like 750 credit scores.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400]   I mean, it was perfect.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.240]   And she came in, and one of the brokers came in and said,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.700]   "Hey, man, can I show you something?"
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.780]   I was like, "Yeah, what's up?"
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.740]   He goes, "Look," he said, "I've got this woman's W-2s here."
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.580]   I said, "Okay."
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.660]   I looked at him, and he goes, "Here's your credit report."
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.500]   And he goes, "Here's the application.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.580]   "This is the social security number."
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.060]   I went, "All right."
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.700]   And he said, "This is the social security number
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.460]   "on the W-2."
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.780]   And I went, "Okay."
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.900]   Keep in mind, you go to get a car loan or credit card,
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.780]   they never ask for these things.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.740]   So, and he was like, I'm really shocked he even noticed it.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.620]   I probably might not have even caught it,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.380]   but they were different.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.560]   And I went, "Really?"
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.400]   And he goes, "Yeah."
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.180]   He said, "So I did, you know, she just brought them in.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.860]   "You know, she's here."
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.620]   And I was like, "Oh, bring her in here."
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.760]   So she came in, sat down, I said,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.780]   "Listen, here's what we just found."
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.080]   And she was like, "Oh, okay, you know what?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.940]   "I don't want the loan."
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.020]   I just, I go, "No, no, no, no."
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.480]   I said, "Listen, you're getting the loan.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.680]   "You got a 750 credit score.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.820]   "Like, I don't care what we have to do.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.680]   "We're getting you the loan.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.240]   "I just wanna know what's going on.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.940]   "How did you get 750 credit scores
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.400]   "under this social security number
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.600]   "when clearly this is your real social security number?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.900]   "You've been working for this company for 10 years.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.260]   "And your credit profile says it's only like three years old."
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.260]   And I was like, "What happened?"
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.260]   And what she told me she did was she went through a divorce.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.600]   She had been married for 10 years,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.000]   used her husband's, I mean, his surname for 10 years.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.680]   So she has no credit under her maiden name.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.600]   But when they got divorced, she switched to her maiden name
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.960]   because when she pulled, tried to get anything
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   in her husband's surname, it was denied, bad credit.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.200]   So he had bad credit, their credit went bad.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.740]   So he switched to her, she switched to her name.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.380]   And a friend told her if she needed to get her electric
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.580]   or anything turned on, she could use her name
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.540]   and use her daughter's or son's social security number,
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.620]   which was like a four-year-old kid.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.740]   So she used that and it went through.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.740]   She had to put a deposit down,
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.820]   but it went through at least, wasn't denied.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.940]   So that went through.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.880]   Then she went and she applied for an apartment with that.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.420]   Sure enough, it went through.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.220]   She had no credit, but they said you don't have bad credit.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.980]   So she said once she moved into the apartment,
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.180]   she then started getting these pre-approved credit cards.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.900]   So she goes, but I knew I had applied there
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.960]   using my son's social security number, let's say.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.100]   So she started filling those out.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.740]   And sure enough, she got a credit card.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.020]   And then she got two.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.560]   And then she got a pre-approval from Ford Motor Credit.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.100]   She went and got herself a new car, got approved.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.260]   She'd been making the payments ever since.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.580]   She has 750 credit scores.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.320]   She thought she'd try her hand at buying a house
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.780]   in his name, in his social security number.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.380]   And we caught it and she got a house in that name.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.300]   We closed it.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.660]   I just was like, wow, this is great.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.020]   - Can I ask you a question about that?
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.820]   Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.940]   - Right.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.940]   - So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical?
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:10.080]   Is it like, it's unethical in that it's messing
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.340]   with the system on which a lot of people rely.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.220]   But it feels like there's some aspect of the system
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.340]   that's broken in that it doesn't give people
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.820]   like her a second chance.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.900]   - She could have claimed bankruptcy.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.300]   And then two years later, listen,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.660]   two years out of bankruptcy, you can go into Bank of America
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.380]   and get a conventional mortgage.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.420]   Assuming you have perfect credit outside the bankruptcy,
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.020]   you have the down payment, you make enough money.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.660]   There's a whole bunch of, you know,
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.420]   a bunch of underwriting guidelines you have to meet.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.980]   But that's possible.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.860]   But you're right.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.140]   For instance, she wasn't getting an apartment
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.460]   using with her bad credit.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.820]   She wasn't getting her utilities turned on.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.340]   She wasn't getting any of those things done.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.340]   - So getting your life back on track is just harder.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.420]   - It's extremely hard.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.460]   - So there's a temptation to take the shortcut,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.680]   and the shortcut is often going to be illegal.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.820]   - Right, and she stumbled into it.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.600]   But she basically explained it to me.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.900]   And I mean, I don't think she had walked out
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.900]   of my brokerage office before I went,
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.660]   and I just started making up, you know, names.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.100]   And I think I went, I went into our file cabinet
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.900]   and grabbed some people's 1040s,
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.220]   which we had, you know, their tax returns,
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.140]   and looked up children's social security numbers,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.020]   and just grabbed some random kids' social security numbers
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.300]   and their name, and went and pulled them.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.980]   But I changed their date of birth to be an adult.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.860]   Pulled it, and sure enough, it came up, no file found.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.940]   You know, it didn't say fraud alert or fraud or anything.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.260]   It didn't say mismatched this, mismatched that.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.100]   It didn't say anything.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.620]   It just said, you know, no file found.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.540]   Well, then we went and we pulled,
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.780]   applied for a couple credit cards
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.740]   using a child's social security number.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.620]   And then we went and pulled our own credit report,
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.040]   and sure enough, it didn't say no file found.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.820]   It just said that there had been two inquiries
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.740]   applying for credit cards.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.840]   So I was like, wow, like that's a credit profile.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.940]   So that turns into me going to social security,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.020]   and calling social security,
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.020]   and trying to get them to issue me social security numbers
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.020]   to adults that had never had a social security number
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.380]   issued to them.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.860]   I need to get social security number
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.820]   to give me a clean social security number.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.980]   But I called up, and of course, you know, I'm a novice.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.820]   I don't really know what I'm doing.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.100]   So I call up and I say, hey, yeah,
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.660]   I never had a social security number issued.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.500]   And they were like, how old are you?
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.420]   And I was like, I'm 31 years old, you know?
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.140]   And they were, yeah, that's not possible.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.500]   Do you have a driver's license?
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.820]   You have a bank account?
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.260]   Yeah, you have a social security number.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.660]   Bring your driver's license in, and we'll pull it up.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.620]   Okay, well, that's not gonna happen.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.660]   Hang up, call back.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.660]   Hi, my son is seven years old, or three years old,
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.860]   and he never had a social security number issued.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.860]   Oh, okay, was he born in a hospital?
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.780]   Yes, well, he has one, he has one.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.700]   Go ahead and get your son, come in here.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.900]   No, I'm not doing that.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.180]   Hang up, call back.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.600]   So I called back probably 10 times.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.460]   And eventually, someone said, I kept altering it.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.460]   Kept altering what I was saying,
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.300]   until I got to the point where I was saying,
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   my son was born with a midwife, not in a hospital,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.060]   and the pediatrician told us that we needed to go,
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.380]   we need to get social security
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.660]   to issue a social security number.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.060]   And they would say, well, he should have issued it,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.420]   but that does happen sometimes.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.900]   So bring your son in, and we'll,
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.020]   you know, you can fill out the paperwork,
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.340]   we'll have one issued.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.580]   You know, first we'll check to see he never had one issued,
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.100]   and if he hasn't, we'll issue one.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.580]   And so then it turned into, my son is out of the country,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.100]   and I need this.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.580]   And then that turned into, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.420]   Well, how old is he?
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.740]   I was like, you know, he's three.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.900]   And they go, well, I'm sorry,
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.540]   if he's over the age of 12 months old, he has to come in.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.700]   Hang up the phone, call back.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.500]   My son is 10 months old, he's out of the country,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.740]   born with a midwife, never had a social security number.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.700]   And then they go, oh, okay, that's fine.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.660]   Just get his birth certificate and his shot record,
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.940]   and you can come in, fill out the paperwork,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.440]   we'll issue you a social security number.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.500]   And that's what I did.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.680]   So I figured out how to create a birth certificate.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.020]   You know, I ordered the security paper,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.340]   you know, where you make a copy,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.940]   it says, you know, void if copied.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.100]   So I had to order a bunch of that,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.420]   and I went online and figured out
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.660]   how to make a fake birth certificate.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.060]   It was great too, 'cause like the county,
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.660]   actually, they give you a blank form,
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.060]   and then they actually show you
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.700]   what it looks like filled out,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.520]   like a handwritten one filled out.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.340]   So I knew if he was born this day,
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.180]   he got these shots.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.780]   Two months later, he got these shots.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.300]   Six months later, he got these shots.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.060]   So I just filled it out.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.540]   I even had to order a seal.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.380]   So you have to have a seal that says like,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.360]   Hillsborough County vital statistics,
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.460]   or Richland County vital statistics or something.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.420]   And I couldn't get anybody to make that.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.060]   So I changed it to like Richland County
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.780]   Office of Virtual Records.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.100]   And then I took like 220 grit sandpaper
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.940]   and hit it over and over and over again to wear it down.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.360]   And then I did the embossment on the corner,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.340]   and I printed it on the security paper, embossed it.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.020]   Nobody looks at those things.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.740]   You could see Richland County.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.060]   You know, you could kind of see that.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.700]   And really, they just grab it and they go like this.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.220]   This is what you realize after you,
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.220]   when I started getting driver's licenses
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.760]   issued by the state DMV, right?
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.820]   The state, I figured out eventually it was easier
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.060]   to just go into the DMV and have them give me
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.740]   a driver's license than actually make one.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.980]   So, but you notice they would just grab the thing.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.100]   They feel the form and go, okay.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.060]   Like they don't even look at it.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.260]   So, which is upsetting.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.380]   If you put as much work into these documents as I am
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.900]   for them to go, okay, yeah, that's good.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.740]   Sit over there.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.540]   I felt like going like, hey bro, like take a look at this.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.660]   This is artwork.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.340]   - Yeah, but they're looking for the low hanging fruit
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.240]   of crappy fraud.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.640]   - Right, yeah, this stuff was right there, so.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.080]   - Okay, so birth certificate gets you
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.120]   a social security number.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.000]   So, it's interesting 'cause you've also,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.960]   you've done a lot of different approaches
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.520]   to creating synthetic people.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.880]   There's homeless people involved.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.360]   So, sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.760]   And then you're, like some part is fake,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.420]   some part is real sometimes, and sometimes
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.880]   it's completely all fake.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.600]   - Right, 'cause now I have the name.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.060]   I have the social security numbering.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.760]   What's great is they mail you.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.900]   What's even better is you get,
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.100]   then you get to pick whatever name you want.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.140]   You know, 'cause when you pick your child's name,
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.300]   he doesn't even have to have your last name.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.140]   You pick any name.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.780]   So, I would pick a name and I'd just say,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.660]   oh, my wife's last name is this, if they questioned it,
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.020]   which they never did.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.680]   But, you know, I've got a social security number,
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.380]   and then I would go apply for credit cards.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.900]   And I'd get denied, of course,
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.020]   but they would all offer me a secured credit card.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.820]   So, I'd then fill out the secured credit card,
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.060]   and I'd send the bank the money,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.620]   and they would give me a secured credit card
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.680]   for $500, $300, 1,000, whatever it was.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.720]   And then, once you start making the payments,
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.540]   I pulled the credit, and a credit profile shows up
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.180]   saying that this 31-year-old man
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.240]   with the social security number that I know was issued,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.920]   you know, a couple months ago, has three credit cards.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   They don't even say secured.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.600]   They just say, there's like, this credit card is $500.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.000]   It was issued by Bank of America.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.120]   This one was issued by Capital One.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.800]   This one, so I've got three of them,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.440]   but I had no credit scores.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.100]   So, at that point, I kind of kicked back and waited.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.720]   I just kept making payments.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.660]   And I remember thinking to myself,
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.720]   I'll bet you that the credit bureaus
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.540]   don't generate credit scores for at least a year.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.200]   And I was like, God, this is gonna be a year-long process.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.320]   And while that was happening, I was starting other ones,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.560]   'cause I figured at least in a year,
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.200]   I'll have a bunch of these, we call them phantom borrowers,
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.120]   but now they call them synthetic identities.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.800]   So, at least I would have these synthetic identities,
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.320]   and maybe I'd do something with them.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.200]   But what happened was, at six months,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.600]   I went and I randomly pulled the guy's credit,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.660]   the person's credit, and I had 705 credit scores.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.340]   705, 701, 695.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.660]   I was like, oh my God, you only needed a 620
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.700]   to get a 95% loan from the bank.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.540]   So, I was like, oh my God, this is amazing.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.700]   Sure enough, a month later,
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.300]   the other ones I had started, all of them, bam, bam, bam.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   - So, what do you do with a phantom borrower?
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.640]   Like, how do you make money on this?
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.140]   - So, I think most people,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.860]   if you were just like a scammer or a fraudster,
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.540]   you would probably just get credit cards,
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.660]   and maybe build up that history,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.620]   or maybe try and borrow a personal loan,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.100]   which is limited.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.700]   Personal loans are, used to be,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:41.860]   used to be you could go to an FDIC insured bank,
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   which borrows money, those personal loans they lend out.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.040]   It's a max of $15,000.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.400]   So, you could do that.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.640]   - So, you can go through this whole process
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.720]   of creating a fake identity, getting a card,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.160]   paying it off, building up credit,
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.320]   and then you get $15,000 at the end, or so.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.920]   - Right, you get 15, maybe,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.320]   if you wanna keep making the payments,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.360]   if you could wait a year,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.720]   you could probably get 15,000, maybe.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.560]   You could maybe get 20, 30,000,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.080]   and a bunch of little smaller ones.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   You get 7,500, 'cause I did,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.720]   there was a $7,500 from Citibank,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.920]   $5,500 from American General.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.040]   So, you maybe get, what, 25,000,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.280]   maybe 30,000 in personal loans.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.900]   Maybe you can, you could then apply for,
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.020]   you could maybe get another 20 or 30,000
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.340]   in regular credit cards, 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.860]   And then you go to the lower department store cards,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.540]   and you go to Home Depot, you get 1,000, you get 500.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.740]   So, it ends up being, maybe you can get 50, 60,000.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.900]   Maybe if you're really good,
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.380]   you could get up to 80 or $100,000
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.340]   in credit cards and personal loans.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.140]   If you really knew what you were doing, but--
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.340]   - Per person, per identity.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.300]   - Per identity.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   But I had the ability to leverage that perfect,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.180]   those perfect credit profiles against properties.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.020]   And, I mean, ultimately, that's what I end up doing.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.560]   And so, each one of those identities was worth,
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.100]   you know, a few million.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.180]   - Can you explain how that works,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.600]   so, to leverage them against property?
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.140]   So, how does that work with a mortgage?
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.020]   - So, what I did, eventually,
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.020]   I mean, this was, like, is down the road,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.780]   but, you know, I mean, at this point,
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.020]   when things were just,
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.520]   my whole life had kinda gone off the rails,
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.740]   I was on federal probation.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.220]   And so, what I did, decided what I was gonna do,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.960]   was start running a scam, a much larger scam.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.920]   And what I was going to do was,
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.980]   I was gonna start flipping properties, right?
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.620]   Like, buy houses cheap, fix 'em up, and sell 'em.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.880]   There's an area of Tampa called Ybor City.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:49.660]   So, I was gonna start flipping houses in Ybor City.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.900]   And, you know, I thought, okay,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.540]   I can buy these houses for,
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.600]   you could buy a really crappy house at that time,
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.740]   for 50, $60,000, let's say 50.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.580]   And then, you could put $25,000 into it, in renovations.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.820]   You could renovate it for 25.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.780]   And maybe you could get an appraisal for 100.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.260]   So, I thought, what I could do is,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:18.260]   I can buy these houses,
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.940]   renovate them, and sell them to regular people.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.380]   But I also had been working on the synthetic identities.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.340]   And then I thought, well,
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.940]   or I could just sell 'em to synthetic identities.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.780]   And then I wouldn't have to dump 25,000 into it, right?
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.880]   And these guys are perfect.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.800]   They have perfect credit.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.620]   I can provide W-2s and pay stubs,
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   because by this point, I'm manufacturing businesses.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.840]   So, I've incorporated businesses.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.900]   I've got websites for the businesses, W-2s, pay stubs.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.860]   So, these guys look perfect.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.340]   So, I figure I'll buy these properties for 50,000,
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.720]   sell to these guys for 100.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.540]   Maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.940]   I don't really have to do anything.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.720]   But that seemed short-sighted.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.220]   So, I thought what'd be even better
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.520]   is that if I did a little bit of renovations,
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.620]   and then I sold it for much higher.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.140]   Maybe I put 10,000, clean up the outside of it,
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.980]   'cause these guys don't care
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.900]   what the inside of the property looks like.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.740]   They don't exist.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.900]   But how am I gonna get an appraisal for $100,000?
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.220]   Well, do you know how appraisals work?
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.140]   Okay, so, the bank sends an appraiser out.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.500]   Or at that time, you could provide an appraisal.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.000]   They can review it.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.780]   So, they'll do what's called a desktop review.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.780]   They review it on the computer.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.900]   They never go out to the property.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.420]   Or they send someone out.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.840]   They call that, it's like a field review.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.420]   They send someone out, and they just look at the house.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.260]   They don't go in it, though.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   So, I have to clean up the outside of the house.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.340]   So, what I did was, but the problem is,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.960]   if your house is, you're trying to sell that house
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.020]   for, let's say, 200,000, the other houses,
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.100]   they have to pick three comparable sales in the area
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.100]   that are also going to support a $200,000 sales price.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.180]   Well, there's no other house that's selling
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.480]   for 200,000 near this house.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.340]   So, I thought, if I wanna get these things appraised
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.340]   for 200,000, 250,000, I have to have comparable sales.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.220]   And that appraisal's going to be reviewed.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:32.460]   So, what I did was, I went out and I bought this house
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   for 50,000, and I recorded the sale at 200,000.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:43.140]   So, when you buy a house for $100,000,
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.260]   you pay $700 in dock stamps.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.860]   But if you pay an extra 700 bucks,
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.960]   the sale shows up for 200,000.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.100]   Well, I'm buying these things for 50, so I'm paying $350.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.100]   And I'm just paying an extra $1,050.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.180]   So, it ends up being $1,400, but the sale shows up
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.960]   at 200,000 on a house that's a crack house
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.280]   I bought for $50,000.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.500]   Now, I go, I trim the trees, we mow the yard,
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.520]   we clean up the porch, we put the porch rail on maybe,
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.660]   we paint it real nice, we black out all the windows,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.980]   you can't see inside, but from the curb, it looks great.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.960]   And I get an appraisal, so I do that with that house,
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.340]   I do that with another house, all within a mile.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:35.380]   So, I buy four houses, knowing I could use the all,
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.060]   there's a subject and three comparables for all of them.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.300]   So, the first thing I did is I bought four houses
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.260]   for 50,000, 60,000, 40,000.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.260]   And I recorded the values at 210, 200, 190.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:53.380]   So, I get an appraiser to come out there, he appraises it.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.500]   Of course, he says it's horrible,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.020]   but there's comparables here.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.460]   Now, of course, it is in bad shape,
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.740]   and he says it's in bad shape,
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.580]   but I go ahead and I correct all that.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.420]   So, I correct it.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.980]   So now, if you review the appraisal
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.460]   and you're in California,
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.140]   or even if you drive your car down,
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.980]   the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.820]   from the street, it looks fine.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.940]   But the truth is, I've got $60,000 into this property
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.180]   and you're appraising it for 200,000.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.540]   So, the bank's ready, they're not gonna lend 200,
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.040]   but they'll lend 190.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   So, the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.160]   $190,000 on a house that I have 60,000 in.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.480]   So, I schedule a closing,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.840]   and we close on the house,
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.960]   and I walk away with $60,000.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.840]   And the thing is, the problem was,
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   is by the time I got to this point,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.420]   I knew so many people in the industry.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.360]   Nobody had to really, at that point, show up,
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.760]   although I've had people show up
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.220]   for the synthetic identities and sign for them.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.880]   Almost all the closings, nobody ever showed up.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.600]   I just showed up to the title agency and said,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.080]   "Hey, my borrower, he's at work right now.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.320]   He can't make it.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.600]   Can I just take the file and I'll have him sign
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.640]   all the documents at his work and I'll bring them back?"
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.720]   He's like an hour and a half away from here.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.800]   I'll be back in two or three hours.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.240]   They're like, "Oh, wow, man, Matt, thank you so much."
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.940]   And they would give it to me,
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.100]   and I'd go sit in the parking lot,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.300]   and I'd sign all the documents,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.900]   and I'd wait an hour or two,
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.580]   and I'd come back in and say, "Here you go."
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.540]   - How were you able to keep all this in your mind?
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.980]   Because you have to not slip up
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.760]   in any of these conversations.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.500]   - It's pretty easy for me to keep them
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.260]   everything in the correct category.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.260]   Does that make sense?
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.100]   I'm not great at a lot of things,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.180]   but this I was very good at.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.780]   - But there's these phantom people that exist,
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.060]   and they were becoming real people in your mind,
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.860]   as in you're able to tell good stories
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.300]   with those people, right?
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.780]   'Cause if you're talking to the appraiser,
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.940]   if you're talking to everybody involved.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.060]   - Well, keep in mind, the appraiser
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.260]   almost never meets the borrower, never.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.420]   Not even almost, like 99.99% of the time,
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.380]   they never meet him.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.380]   - But you have to talk about them.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.300]   - Yeah.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.260]   - So I guess what I'm asking is you're able
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.620]   to converse fluently about these synthetic identities.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.100]   - Yeah, they all had different jobs.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.520]   They all had, all the jobs were basically,
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.100]   they were all on the job for five years.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.380]   They were all, a lot of it was--
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.660]   - Sure, there's a template.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.940]   But-- - Yeah, got it.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.980]   - Listen, matter of fact, almost every one of them
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.060]   had the same birthdate, you know?
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.260]   So, because I, who knows?
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.860]   So, yeah, it wasn't difficult.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.900]   And keep in mind, a lot of the brokers
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.100]   barely ever meet the borrower.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.020]   They call in on the phone, but it didn't matter anyway,
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.420]   'cause I'm walking in saying,
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.620]   I got a slam dunk deal for you.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.940]   And they're like, oh, wow, Matt,
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.460]   you got the W-2s, the pay stubs,
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.300]   you've got all their rental history.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.140]   You have everything done, it's perfect.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.420]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.660]   They're happy to do it.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.260]   Hey, I print up the docs and I'll have them go sign it.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.500]   Great, wow, thank you.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.620]   You know, assuming they didn't already know about it,
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.300]   and almost everybody involved in this,
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.100]   by the time I was done, was involved.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.020]   There was probably 15 or 20 people
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.780]   that all knew what was going on.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.140]   - The full of it, they knew the full depth of it.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.580]   - Yes, yeah, yeah.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.220]   Maybe not 100% everything,
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.460]   but they definitely knew this is fraud.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.500]   - And they were still going along with it.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:41.820]   Keep in mind that even when, I'll give you an example.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.140]   One of my, you know, let's say,
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.260]   and this happened with almost all of them,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.060]   was he would buy five houses.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.500]   So the guy bought, what happens,
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.300]   the basic design was I buy the houses,
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.020]   I record the values higher,
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:05.980]   and this person buys all five houses, refinances them.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.220]   He ends up borrowing a little bit
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.320]   over a million dollars in his name.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.900]   Then, of course, then I go and I get personal loans
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.420]   from several banks, I get credit cards,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.060]   I run up all of his credit cards.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.740]   By this point, I've got 10, $20,000 worth of credit cards
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.580]   in the guy's name.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.300]   So the guys are all worth like a million, million and change.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.540]   Well, once I stop paying,
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.140]   you start getting letters from the collection companies,
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.940]   right, from the banks, and then they sell them off.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.820]   So after about three months, you're getting tons of letters.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.280]   And what I would do is I would take my borrowers,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.980]   name, I would go online and I would find,
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.540]   or I'd go in the newspaper, and I would find,
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.180]   I would find an article about, let's say,
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.700]   like a 12-car pileup.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.660]   So there's a huge accident on I-4, it's very dangerous.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.500]   So there's a 12-car pileup, and someone in the accident
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.000]   I would cut and paste that article,
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.360]   and I would just insert my borrower's name
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.500]   into the article saying that Brandon Green
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.440]   was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.180]   He's currently in critical condition.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   I would then print that article out on newsprint.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.080]   I'd then make a copy of the, cut it up,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.360]   make a copy of the newsprint, highlight his name,
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.560]   and I would write a letter
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.080]   from Brandon Green's fictional sister
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.920]   to the collection companies saying,
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.260]   several months ago, my brother was in
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.300]   a horrible car accident, he is currently,
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.380]   they've got the article, they have the highlighted name,
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.700]   he clearly was in this accident,
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.180]   he is currently in a coma, and the doctors say
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.160]   even if he wakes up from the coma, he will never work again.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:58.020]   So you might as well just stop writing those letters
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.180]   and take the houses back.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.680]   And that's all they're looking for is a reason.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.420]   At this point, even if they look into Brandon Green,
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.980]   they can't figure out if he's a real person or not.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.020]   Because he's got a social security number,
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.700]   he's got, and everything went bad at the same time.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.980]   He's got multiple rental properties
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.220]   or his primary residence, all of his credit cards went bad,
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.860]   everything went bad, we have an excuse,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.020]   we have a letter, that happens.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.820]   People get divorced, they lose their job,
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.900]   they get in accidents, it's reasonable.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.140]   - When they look into it, oh, it looks legitimate.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.540]   - Even if they ordered another appraisal.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.900]   By this point, it's not four comparable sales,
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.140]   or three or four comparable sales.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.680]   By this point, it's like 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50,
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.060]   'cause I kept making more and more of these guys.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.460]   - What was your, just almost like a tangent,
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.420]   what's your thinking process?
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.540]   There's a lot of cleverness going on here.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.380]   So like the car pileup is a solution.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.040]   Newspaper, you mail it.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:00.140]   Are you sitting there alone and thinking through this?
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.100]   Like how do you come up with that idea?
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.420]   It's a very interesting, a very clever, innovative idea.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.300]   - So at first, I thought about making
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.060]   like a fake death certificate, that he died.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.260]   But I thought, I don't know, like what if,
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.260]   like some of these places had like primary mortgage
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.460]   insurance, like what if the primary mortgage insurance,
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.580]   like what if they try and claim 'cause he was dead,
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.780]   or like I don't know, I don't know that side,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.060]   so I'm like, ugh, I don't wanna do that.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.020]   I wanna do something that's semi-verifiable
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.140]   and third party, it's like a third party telling you
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.980]   this is what happened.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.140]   I thought, well, like the newspaper, you know?
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.420]   And, you know, or do I claim bankruptcy?
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.540]   And I've done that, I've gone and got the bankruptcy forms.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.200]   Right, you can go to the bankruptcy court
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.980]   and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.860]   and you mail 'em, they stop contacting you,
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.280]   they wait to be located by, or notified
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.340]   by the bankruptcy court.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.380]   But my fear there is, you know,
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.860]   nobody's ever gonna notify them.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.300]   Like, I'm not going through bankruptcy
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.740]   for one of these guys.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.340]   So it was like, this is a better bet
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.620]   than just writing a letter saying,
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.700]   I'm going through a divorce,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.980]   my wife's keeping those houses, that's her problem.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.420]   You know, you could, there's lots of things you could do,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.700]   but to me this was, they're not gonna try and,
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.540]   how do you shut it down without him dying?
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.700]   How do you shut that down?
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.980]   This is how you shut it down.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.160]   He's in a coma, he'll never work again.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.660]   He was in a car accident, here's the proof.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.760]   He can't even write you, I'm his sister.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.740]   I wrote you the letter.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.940]   - It's a one-time letter that seems to tie up all--
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.920]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.160]   You know, I don't know exactly how that,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.980]   you know, what sparked that as much as,
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.260]   there were so many other avenues that I could have gone
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.100]   that I was, I just didn't know.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.460]   - But you were thinking through all those different avenues.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.300]   - Yeah.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.100]   - Are you mostly thinking alone?
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.500]   - I mean, you know, I had guys that I was bouncing--
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.900]   - Ideas from. - Ideas off of.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.740]   There were other guys that were involved in the scam.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.200]   You know, everybody, I think that scam ended up making,
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.980]   like, I think the FBI said,
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.720]   I think it was like 11 and a half million or something,
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   and, you know, but there were so many other people
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.440]   that were involved in that scam that were, you know,
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.120]   this guy's getting 50, this guy's getting 20, you know,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.120]   17,000, 20,000, 25,000, and you know,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.120]   we're just doing it constantly.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.540]   And so the bank would foreclose on that property,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.020]   they'd take it back, they'd put it back on the MLS,
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:31.160]   they'd put it back on the MLS for 200,000, it wouldn't sell.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.520]   Then they'd drop it to, you know, 150, wouldn't sell.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.360]   Then they'd drop it to 125, 130, wouldn't sell.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.600]   They'd drop it to 90, and somebody'd buy it for like 90.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.280]   It wasn't worth 90.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.480]   But by that point, that whole area had,
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.320]   we'd done so many houses at that point,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.360]   the whole area shot up.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.520]   And the FBI said we did 109 houses.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.800]   I don't think that's true.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   But we, when I end up leaving Tampa,
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.340]   after that scam falls apart and the FBI shows up,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.660]   Forbes came out with an article, whatever, six months later,
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.660]   and they said that the Ybor City zip code
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:13.500]   was one of the top 20 fastest-growing,
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.380]   appraising areas in the country.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.620]   And you know, everybody was like, oh, that's mad,
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.740]   'cause this place is a dump.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.060]   Like, this is a horrible place.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.200]   Like, this is, and I remember one time,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.340]   I had talked to a guy, you know, years later,
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.140]   and he was like, ah, all the comparable sales have dried up.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.380]   Like, when you left, there was just nothing
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.140]   even close to 200,000.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.940]   - You mentioned right before,
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.840]   telling the story of this elaborate scam,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.540]   that you were on federal probation.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.040]   How did that happen?
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.940]   - So I mentioned that I own the mortgage company, right?
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.580]   So I had started a mortgage company.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.260]   I had maybe a dozen guys working for me.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.620]   And there was fraud, you know?
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.660]   Like, I would say, it wasn't all fraud, but whatever.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.260]   60, 70% of it was fraud that was going in there.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.540]   And from the outside of that business,
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.140]   it looked very legitimate.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.860]   You know, we were an FHA-approved lender.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.380]   We were a VA-approved lender.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.220]   We did conventional.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.040]   Probably signed up with 40 or 50 subprime lenders.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.820]   But there was a considerable amount of fraud.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.620]   And you know, it kept getting, you know,
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.860]   it became a game, right?
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.620]   You know, you start,
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.380]   I started getting just more and more creative.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.340]   Like I said, every time I would get away with something,
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.940]   like you become emboldened by it.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.140]   It's like, nice!
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.220]   You know, like, hey, the underwriter's looking for this,
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.540]   and looking for this, and you sit there and go,
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.200]   man, so that she's, you know, that's,
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.040]   what am I gonna do?
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.020]   You know what we could do?
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.940]   We could create our own bank.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.760]   What?
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.820]   Yeah, here's what we're gonna do.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.740]   We're gonna go on, like,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.200]   how do they know if this bank exists?
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.400]   These people are in California, or they're in New York.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.540]   Like, they don't know.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.820]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go online,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.380]   and keep in mind, this is 2000,
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.700]   you know, this is 2000, 2001.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   Like, this is, the internet's in its infancy still, right?
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.020]   So we figure out,
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.820]   I remember GoDaddy, I think,
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.820]   had just come up with a site
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.200]   where you could build your own website.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.160]   Like, how cool is that?
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.780]   So I go online with a buddy of mine,
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:17.100]   and we create something called the Bank of Ebor.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.900]   You know, we cut and pasted things
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.020]   that we like from other banks,
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.460]   and we got a 1-800 number you could call,
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.100]   or a 1-86 number, whatever it was,
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.580]   and you could call it, and it would go to a voicemail,
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.500]   and so we set up this bank,
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.480]   and then I ended up making bank statements,
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.620]   which, by this point,
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.840]   I already had been making bank statements
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.020]   to prove someone has their down payment.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.340]   'Cause a lot of times, people,
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.940]   they have good enough credit to borrow 95% or 90%,
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.580]   but they don't have their down payment.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.420]   So we'd raise the purchase price high enough
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.140]   to cover their 5% or 10% down payment,
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.620]   and we would bring their down payment for them,
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.100]   or we'd have the owner of the house
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.940]   bring the down payment for them,
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.380]   and then we would have a check cut
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.300]   out of the closing statement
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.440]   to a construction company that I owned,
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.820]   and we'd get our money back.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.380]   So they get into the house for 100% financing,
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.140]   or 110%, some of them turned into 130,
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.620]   we wanna pay off their car,
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.260]   give them an incentive to sign.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.740]   They still don't have the money to buy it.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.940]   So we're doing all kinds of insane things.
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.580]   Well, at some point,
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:31.600]   remember Gretchen Zayas, my old manager?
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.100]   - Yeah, the original.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.340]   - Yes. - The OG.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:37.660]   - She came and worked for me for a short period of time,
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.380]   and then she and her husband
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.760]   went and opened their own mortgage company,
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.620]   which you should have known
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.580]   it was gonna be fraudulent from the get-go,
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.620]   because it was called Creative Financing.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:54.620]   Yeah, C-F-M, Creative Finance, no, Creative.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.540]   - Creative was in the name.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.500]   - Yeah, yeah, Creative was in the name.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.740]   - Oh, boy.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   - So-- - It's really on the nose.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:04.520]   - So she's doing very well,
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.480]   and we became very close, by the way.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:12.660]   We'd go on vacation, went to Puerto Rico together.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.060]   I got married at the time, I was married.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.940]   Our kids play together.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.180]   We babysit, we go to each other's parties.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.000]   We're close, we're good friends.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.980]   And she's got her own mortgage company.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.340]   She calls me up periodically and asks me,
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.660]   "Hey, can you make a W-2?"
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:27.980]   Or, "Hey, can you make me a pay stub?"
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.260]   Sure, no problem, we're friends.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.100]   That's what fraudulent friends do.
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:36.240]   So if I needed somebody to verify rent,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.100]   or verify somebody's rental history or employment,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.980]   she had cell phones, she would answer,
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.100]   that sort of thing for me.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.100]   Well, what ends up happening is
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:54.100]   she gets in trouble.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.740]   She starts doing fraudulent loans for some guys.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:04.740]   And these guys are doing what's called a cashback scam.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.860]   So they're getting a half a million dollar loan
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   on a house that's worth $300,000.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.700]   So they're buying the house for whatever, 600,000.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.600]   It's really only worth 300, 350.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.140]   But she happened to be in an area
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.460]   where she could get the appraisal jacked up.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.460]   So they buy the house, they get two, $300,000 back.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.780]   And it's a straw man scam, right?
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.340]   It's a cashback straw man scam.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.300]   So it's a real person that's buying the house.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.360]   He's got perfect credit.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.560]   But he's willing to let, to ruin his credit
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.740]   to get a couple hundred thousand in his pocket.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.780]   So he never has any intentions.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.340]   So it's not a synthetic identity.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.180]   It's not a stolen identity.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.100]   It's a straw man.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.020]   He's a fake, kind of a, not a fake person,
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.860]   but he's just a straw man.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.780]   He's a stand-in.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.540]   So he stands in, he signs the paperwork.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.060]   He buys the house.
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:58.500]   They end up getting two, $300,000.
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.660]   Well, this guy buys like five houses.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.860]   So it's a cut, two, $3 million.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:07.340]   They've lost five, six, $700,000.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.200]   And these guys never even make the first payment.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.640]   They just let them go into foreclosure.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.320]   So the bank immediately investigates
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.200]   and realizes this is fraud.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.600]   So the FBI comes in, they grab Pete and Gretchen.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.920]   She has to hire an attorney, of course.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.440]   And she doesn't get thrown in jail or anything.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.640]   They just come to their office
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.560]   and they tell them they're investigating them.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.520]   They know what's going on and they wanna talk to,
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.920]   they're like, "Oh, look, we wanna talk to you
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.720]   "and you're going to be indicted."
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.680]   Okay, so she comes to me.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.900]   Well, actually Pete came to me and said,
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.240]   "Look, man, can you refinance our house
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.300]   "and get a 75,000 out to pay our attorney?"
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.340]   I said, "No problem."
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:44.520]   Gretchen gives me W-2s, pay subs, fake.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.560]   The whole thing's fake.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.720]   I get her, I refinance.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.500]   I get a second mortgage on our house, $75,000.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.100]   They pay their attorney.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.740]   Their attorney immediately says,
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   "You need to wear a wire on this guy.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.760]   "Like he just got you $75,000.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.960]   "I don't know how you got $75,000."
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.080]   The attorney knows something's wrong
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.240]   'cause the attorney's like, they just,
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   your whole mortgage company was just shut down.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.040]   There's no way you could borrow $75,000.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.140]   So he's like, "This guy's doing fraudulent stuff."
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.560]   And she says, "Yes, of course he is."
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.440]   And he says, "You need to work with the FBI,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.080]   "wear a wire against this guy."
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.920]   So she calls me one day and says,
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.760]   "Listen, I gotta talk to you.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.280]   "The FBI is asking questions about you."
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.120]   And I go, "What?"
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.200]   And she goes, "Yeah."
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.020]   I was like, "Meet me at the pizza place down the street.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.640]   "So don't come into my office."
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.020]   'Cause everybody knows she's been indicted.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.800]   Like everybody in her office quit when the FBI,
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.640]   the FBI shows up and gives you a business card
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.240]   and announces they're the FBI.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.000]   Everybody quits.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.200]   So I said, "Do not have, do not, don't, don't come here
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.840]   "'cause they already know, they're already concerned."
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.240]   So I go and I meet her and Pete
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.560]   and we sit down at the, at a restaurant,
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.880]   you know, a little pizzeria.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.040]   And I sit down and she starts telling me
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.760]   that the FBI is asking questions about me.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.880]   And I'm like, "Well, what are you talking about?
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.720]   "Like, what are they asking?"
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.380]   And she goes, "Look, they came in,
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.200]   "they took all our files."
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.800]   And like, I was like, "I don't know any of this."
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   I'm like, "When did this happen?"
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.360]   She's like, "Yeah, they, a couple of weeks ago."
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.920]   And they, and they have some of your files.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   'Cause I had closed several loans for my wife at the time.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:16.400]   We were buying rental properties.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.180]   My wife didn't have a job.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.480]   So they're, it's all fraud.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:24.200]   But I couldn't, I could not close those loans in,
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.280]   at my mortgage company because I own the property.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.960]   So I'm selling those properties.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.760]   I bought properties, renovated them
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.680]   and sold them to my wife
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.320]   to get around something called seasoning.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.040]   Seasoning says you have to wait six months to a year
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.440]   to refinance at the market value.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.280]   Otherwise, if you wanna refinance, that's fine,
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.560]   but you have to refinance at the price
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.100]   you purchased the property at.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.720]   But I bought these properties for 80 or 100,000,
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.960]   renovated them, sold them for two, 300,000 to my wife,
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.520]   who got a very, didn't even get a big mortgage.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.140]   We were just trying to kind of get around a guideline.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.520]   So, but my wife was not working
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.400]   and I provided W-2s and pay stubs.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.160]   So when she says all this, she says,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.460]   "Yeah, they're looking at the loans you gave me
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.320]   "at your wife's loans."
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.520]   And I went, "Oh my God."
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.720]   I said, "Well, you didn't tell them
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.780]   "that the W-2s were fake, did you?
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.240]   "You didn't tell them the pay stubs were fake, did you?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.080]   "You didn't tell them that the down payments were,
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.460]   "you didn't tell them that we were married, did you?"
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:27.600]   I mean, just absolutely buried myself.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.620]   And as I'm telling her this,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:34.260]   I was like, okay, I kind of caught myself
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.300]   and I went, "Okay, wait a minute, look.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.880]   "Okay, here's what you're gonna tell them.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.380]   "You're going to tell them you never met her.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.600]   "She called on the phone."
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.220]   Like I start trying to devise a plan
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.600]   that will answer their questions
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:49.200]   without getting my wife in trouble or them in trouble.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.640]   And if nobody cooperates, the whole thing should shut down.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.680]   You know, it doesn't go anywhere.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.560]   There's no way, there's nowhere for them to go.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   Everybody just kind of stonewalls them.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.940]   So as I'm saying all this,
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.620]   Gretchen says, "Matt, we can't lie to the FBI."
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.460]   And I go, "What are you talking about?
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.720]   "You're already lying to the FBI.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.200]   "I mean, you've been lying to the FBI.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.640]   "I mean, I just refinanced your house."
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.080]   And before I can really say anything, Pete jumps up.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.660]   Her husband stands up and he says,
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.320]   "We've never lied to the FBI.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.780]   "We may not have told them everything,
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.360]   "but we've never lied."
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.060]   And I thought like, "Who are you talking to?"
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.380]   Like, I know that's not true.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.760]   So you're not saying that for my benefit.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.300]   So I was just, I kind of look at them and I'm like, "What?"
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.100]   And I remember looking down, and this may mean nothing,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.200]   but both of their cell phones were right next to me, right?
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.420]   And I remember, they were probably just wearing wires,
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.580]   but I just remember thinking,
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.300]   "Those cell phones are microphones."
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   They probably weren't.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.580]   But I remember thinking, "Oh, wow."
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.680]   And I just, I looked at her and I went, "Wow."
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.980]   And I said, "Well, I hope you're gonna get
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.620]   "something for this."
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.540]   And she immediately starts crying.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.620]   And she says, "Matt, I'm sorry.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.680]   "I have a kid.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.420]   "I can't go to jail."
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.500]   - You have kids at that point?
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.840]   - Yeah, like, "I have a kid.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.180]   "Like, I have a kid."
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.620]   And I was like, "Wow, I, wow."
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.460]   - What have you learned about friendship from that?
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.060]   Like, loyalty?
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.060]   - Oh yeah, there's no, there's, that's a,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.380]   that's, it's sweet.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.340]   - That must've hurt.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.340]   - It's cute.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.660]   I mean, I love the idea of it.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.700]   - You don't think that--
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.500]   - No, I'll tell you why.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.180]   So, I go back to my, I go back to my office.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.920]   I remember I told her, I said, "Tell the FBI agent
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.800]   "to call me on the phone.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.440]   "Do not come in my office."
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.280]   So I go back.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.920]   I'm still trying to figure out how to weather this, right?
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.180]   I go back, I sit down.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.660]   Phone rings.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.540]   My secretary comes in and says, "Hey, agent,"
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   I'll never forget the guy's name,
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.980]   "Agent Scott Gale with the FBI."
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.740]   And I was like, "Okay, he's on the phone."
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.580]   And she's standing there.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.940]   I was like, "Close the door.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:55.900]   "Get out and close it."
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.740]   She's like.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.580]   So, get on the phone.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.020]   He asked me if I'll come down.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.080]   I said, "Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.100]   "Let's schedule it for next Tuesday."
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.160]   You know, I put it off four or five days.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.120]   I go to my brother-in-law immediately,
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.580]   who's a lawyer, and he says, "Oh yeah, yeah."
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.140]   I mean, I don't really tell him exactly what's going on,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.260]   but I tell him this is what's happening, kind of,
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.260]   and I may be in trouble.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.460]   I need a federal defense attorney.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.580]   I don't even know what a federal defense,
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.420]   I don't even know the difference,
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.740]   but he said, "You need a federal defense attorney.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.620]   "It's the FBI."
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.820]   So, we go on a couple, we meet a couple lawyers.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.420]   I end up getting a lawyer.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.140]   I give him like 75 grand.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.780]   And he started to have me convinced,
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.060]   initially, he had me convinced
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.780]   I was probably gonna go to jail for a few years.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.900]   But really, that's what they kind of do
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.100]   to justify you giving them $75,000.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.500]   And then, but the more I thought about it and read,
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.740]   he gave me the guidelines that supposedly I had,
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.540]   the fraud that I had committed
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.140]   and the guidelines that oversaw that.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.580]   And I read it, and I was like,
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.640]   "I'm not really in trouble here,
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.600]   "because I'm looking at a felony,
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.680]   "but I'm not gonna go to jail,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.380]   "because there was no potential
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.660]   "for the bank to lose money."
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.880]   Because I bought the house with like a hard money loan,
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.620]   and then I renovated it with my own cash.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.160]   And when I sold it, it appraised at 250,000.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.120]   My ex-wife borrowed like 180.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.000]   So, there's plenty of equity.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.720]   If the whole thing had gone into foreclosure,
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.080]   they still would have got their money back.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.600]   And to be honest, by the time all this happened,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   there was only like three of the three properties.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.280]   It was like five, but we'd already sold a few.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.400]   And at this point, we'd just sold another two.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.480]   There's like one or two properties left.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.960]   So, we're selling, at that moment, we were selling them.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.240]   So, I was like, "No."
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.480]   I kind of argue with him, but then he wanted 75 grand.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.520]   I gave him 75 grand.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.860]   And then he comes back, and he says, "Good news.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.760]   "There was no potential fraud.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.900]   "So, I can get you three years."
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.200]   Now, here's the thing.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.360]   Here's what I always kind of look back at.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.960]   When I first went into his office, he said,
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.660]   he said, "Listen, you haven't been indicted yet.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.000]   "I spoke with the FBI.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.640]   "I spoke with the U.S. attorney.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.320]   "They believe, and they've been told."
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.920]   And he said, "Look, they didn't tell me
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.160]   "exactly what they have, but they said
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.500]   "with the evidence that they have on you,
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.940]   "based on two confidential informants,
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:28.560]   "that you cannot go to trial."
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.680]   And I was like, "Right."
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.680]   Of course, I knew that.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.680]   And I was like, "Okay."
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.520]   He said, "But," he said, "you haven't been indicted yet.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.200]   "And they are fairly certain that you're running a mill,
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.060]   "right, a fraud mill over there,
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.880]   "and that you guys are churning out fraudulent loans.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.000]   "Now, they can't come and raid your office
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.480]   "and do anything about it yet,
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.240]   "'cause so far, they only have you."
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.440]   But here's what I'm saying is that,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.760]   he said, "I can keep you from being indicted."
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.700]   It's called pretrial, it's a pretrial intervention,
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.520]   where we go in, and what we'll do is,
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.600]   you go, you work, you go in, talk to the FBI.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.640]   You go grab a bunch of your mortgage broker's
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.600]   most egregious files.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.680]   Grab them, bring those files to the FBI,
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.160]   go work with the FBI, they will indict them,
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.440]   and you will not be indicted.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.280]   And I said, which I kick myself to this day,
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.700]   I said, "Absolutely not.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.720]   "I'm not gonna snitch on them.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.560]   "I'm not gonna cooperate.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.480]   "I'm not going to, you know, I'd seen the Godfather.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.920]   "You're not supposed to cooperate.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.620]   "You're supposed to be loyal.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.400]   "I'm not gonna do any of that."
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.140]   And so I say all of this,
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:54.660]   where looking back, if I could go back in time,
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.980]   I would have gone into our weekly meeting with a dolly,
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.480]   and I would have walked in front of everybody
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.720]   and scooped up two or three of the file cabinets
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.640]   and put 'em in the back of a truck and said,
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.120]   "Listen, you guys are gonna be talking to the FBI soon.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.320]   "I suggest you get attorneys."
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.700]   And I would have driven off.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.000]   But I didn't.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   I thought, "No, be loyal, you know, don't do that."
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.500]   And what happened was when the other thing falls apart,
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.140]   right, when the next scam falls apart,
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.960]   every one of these people go to the FBI.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.720]   Like, they're not even coming to them.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.600]   These guys are going to the FBI with lawyers.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.560]   I wanna cooperate.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.160]   I wanna tell you what Cox did.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.080]   I wanna help.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.480]   I wanna, and I'm thinking like,
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.160]   I never had to get indicted to begin with.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.220]   - So you think that most of these people,
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:48.120]   from your experience, are going to sacrifice all integrity.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   That's a funny word.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.960]   Sacrifice.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.160]   - I'm not sure that applies to this, but that's right.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   - They're going to sacrifice friendships and loyalty
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.880]   for just to save their own ass.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.700]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.640]   I only had one person that did not talk to the FBI.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.400]   I had one person that every time the FBI
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.200]   or the Secret Service went to that person's door,
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.360]   she said, "Don't come to my house again.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.600]   "I don't have anything to say about Matt.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.300]   "I have nothing to do with any of this.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.380]   "Talk to my lawyer."
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.520]   And this happened over and over again.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.120]   And that's my ex-wife.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.200]   She's a gangster.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.360]   - So are there people in this world you trusted
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.940]   or you still trust?
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   - You know, the problem is eventually I cooperate.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:41.880]   And at the time I didn't want to cooperate.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.040]   I didn't believe in cooperation.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.560]   But after seeing how many people cooperate
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.160]   and the way the system is set up,
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.720]   I think that my understanding of loyalty
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   is vastly more realistic now.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.560]   And I think that if you're committing crime,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.680]   if you're, absolutely, like the things I did,
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   I did a bunch of scumbag things.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.920]   I mean, I'm not killing people,
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   but I'm doing scumbag things.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.400]   I'm lying, cheating, stealing.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.660]   I'm a thief.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.120]   You boil down to it, that's what I am.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.040]   So you can't go around behaving like a scumbag,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.560]   dealing with scumbags,
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.600]   and then expect those same scumbags
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.560]   to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.720]   and not roll over on you.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.520]   You know, and it does happen.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   But it's in the 90 percentile of people that cooperate.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   90-something percent.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.480]   And people cooperate
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.560]   when they're not even looking at any real time.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.720]   So if you're looking at 30 years,
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.680]   and especially after going to prison,
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.800]   you go to prison and it's like,
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.080]   this guy's a stand-up guy over here.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.900]   He got 30 years.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.800]   He could have cooperated against all of his co-defendants,
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.640]   but he didn't.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.800]   Nobody comes to see him.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.180]   His wife divorced him.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.360]   You know, his kids ended up in foster care.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   His friends are cleaning out his house.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   Nobody puts money on his books.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.280]   Nobody comes to see him.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.760]   Nobody answers his phone.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.600]   Nothing.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.480]   He took 30 years.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.960]   Most of those guys turned around.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.400]   They end up getting indicted for other things years later.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.280]   They cooperate.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.040]   And the best thing this guy's got going for him
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.920]   is that he can walk around and say,
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.400]   well, he's a stand-up guy.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.240]   That guy's going to the same halfway house as me.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.760]   He's gonna do 30 years where I'm gonna do 10.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.920]   - Stand-up guy meaning he never snitched.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.760]   - Right.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.400]   - And so everybody's seeing this example
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.720]   and saying, well, I'm going to snitch then.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.600]   But it sounds like what people are doing
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.360]   is they're signaling, virtue signaling,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.000]   like they would never snitch and actually do secretly.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.360]   - I mean, what is it?
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   I remember I talked to one of the COs at the prison one time
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.760]   and he said, I said, shit, I said,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.400]   50% of the guys here snitched.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.440]   He goes, it's more than that.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.280]   He said, but listen, he was 100% of them are lying about it.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.160]   He said, so there's nobody here
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.600]   that's gonna tell you they snitched.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.520]   Nobody.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.240]   So there's guys, tons of them that cooperate.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   If 80, 90% of defendants cooperate,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.840]   you know, you start doing the math.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.800]   And if you ask 10 guys in prison,
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.120]   all of them say, I didn't cooperate.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:34.960]   I didn't cooperate.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.800]   I didn't cooperate.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.960]   Like, okay, well, you ask 100, I didn't cooperate.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.720]   Nobody's gonna say I cooperated.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.640]   - Does that break your heart a little bit,
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.080]   that people backstab each other like this?
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.440]   - It does, it does.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   But, you know, I have such a low opinion of people.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.120]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.560]   Like, I don't expect, it's not that I don't like people.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.520]   It's that I just don't expect anything of them.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.920]   You know, I don't expect you to look out for me.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.160]   You know, there was a time when I did.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.000]   I thought, I look out for you.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   You should look out for me.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.120]   But I just don't expect that anymore.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.760]   - See, but I think humanity flourishes
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.960]   because there is a lot of people out there
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.520]   that do the thing that is difficult to do
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.040]   in terms of integrity.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.200]   - That may be, but these aren't people with integrity.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.320]   These are criminals.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.080]   If these were decent human beings,
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.680]   and all of them will tell you, well, why'd you do that?
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.640]   Oh, you know, I was a drug addict or I needed the money.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.360]   Well, if you were a decent human being,
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.920]   you would have gotten off the drugs.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.040]   You would have gone and gotten three jobs.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.240]   You can work 80 hours a week.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.080]   I've done it.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.840]   You can work 84, 85, 80, you can work 90 hours a week.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.680]   You can do that.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.520]   Oh, I did it for my kids.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.480]   No, you're lazy.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.600]   You could have worked three jobs for your kids.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.200]   Instead, you decided to sell methamphetamine.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.600]   Well, I was addicted.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.760]   You could have gotten off.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.640]   It wasn't important.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.400]   It was the easy way out.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.200]   You're not someone with integrity.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.240]   So for you to sit there and say,
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.140]   hey, I'm gonna act like a scumbag,
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.260]   but now I got caught or you got caught,
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.580]   and I don't want you to tell on me.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.960]   Well, you're a guy that robs banks.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.520]   You stick guns in people's faces.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.440]   You kidnap people.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.700]   You torture people.
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.400]   You sell drugs.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.640]   You're not a moral, ethical person,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.320]   but you want everybody else to hold up
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.300]   to some ethical code while you're robbing grandma.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.600]   That's not right.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   So I get the whole Omarta code.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.600]   And there was a time when I was delusional
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.240]   enough to believe that.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.440]   But after you're going through it, no.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.720]   And after going through it multiple times, no.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.480]   - I have to really think about that.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.120]   And I deeply appreciate your honesty on this.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.540]   - Okay.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:59.360]   - I think, I mean,
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:05.440]   there's all kinds of criminals in this world,
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.400]   and they all have all kinds of stories.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.780]   And your story is one of,
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.860]   I don't know if it came from desperation,
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.860]   versus a love of this kind of game, right?
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:25.540]   Like it wasn't part of it an attraction
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:28.980]   to the creative aspect of this,
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.860]   of breaking the rules when nobody else can,
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.560]   and you figure out a way to do it?
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   - I think initially it was, I needed the money.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.480]   Like that's the first thing, you know?
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.640]   You say, oh, okay, well, and if you ask most guys,
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.980]   oh, well, man, I needed the money.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.320]   You need the money.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.660]   But, and then I definitely needed the money.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:58.440]   But then you get $50,000 in your bank,
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.560]   and then you get 100, and then it's 200,
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.220]   and then it's half a million, and then it's a million,
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.740]   and what the hell are you still committing fraud for?
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.040]   You've got half a million or a million dollars in the bank,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.900]   or worth of real estate,
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:13.220]   or you're making five, $10,000 a month
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.260]   just in rental income.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.420]   Why are you still committing fraud?
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:21.420]   So it turned, I think it morphs into the creativity
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.260]   in part for me, and two, it was a chance for me
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:30.940]   to prove to everybody how smart I was, you know?
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:34.380]   I mean, it was done out of desperation initially,
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:39.380]   and then it just turned into pure narcissistic arrogance.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.620]   Look at me, look at how I can do things
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.260]   that nobody else can do.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.540]   Look how smart I am.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.060]   I just walked into Bank of America,
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.420]   handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent,
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.860]   and they cut me a check for $250,000.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.100]   Like, wow, I'm amazing, you know?
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.160]   And guess what?
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.820]   They're never gonna get their check,
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.340]   and they won't even know where to start
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.360]   to try and find the person
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.240]   because they're looking for a phantom.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.880]   So, you know, and you feel great.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.780]   I felt great.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   I used to, I felt like James Bond.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.220]   I felt like 007.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.700]   It was amazing, and you know, and it did it.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.700]   It feeded my need to feel important, you know?
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:25.700]   Even if it was, even if that was a lie,
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.860]   'cause all that success was just a lie.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.500]   - Well, no, you were good at it.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500]   - It was good at it, but it was,
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:37.320]   it's not, it's not like I'm Elon Musk.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.420]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.600]   It's not like I'm an exceptional human,
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.560]   I'm an exceptional human being
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.900]   at a horrific thing, at committing fraud.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.360]   - Well, the question is how many people are getting hurt
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.720]   because--
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   - Initially, the thing is, initially, nobody got hurt.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.880]   That's the thing.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.920]   Nobody ever lost any money directly.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.280]   Like, I didn't go and say, "Give me $50,000,"
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.520]   and I ran off with your money.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.360]   Like, I wasn't doing that,
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.540]   and that was a great justification.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.480]   But at some point, and we'll get into that,
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.120]   you know, I take off on the run,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.640]   and people do lose money.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.880]   I didn't take that money directly,
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.420]   and for some reason, in my, you know,
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.240]   sick mind or whatever the case may be,
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.280]   that seems like a distinction to me
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.720]   that makes me feel okay,
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:27.480]   is that I never said, "Give me $10,000,"
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.040]   and I ran off with it.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.600]   But I put people in a position
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.320]   where I damaged the credit,
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.620]   or damaged the title to their house,
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.840]   and they had to go get a lawyer to fix that.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.080]   You know, and so that,
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.800]   they had to go pay a lawyer $10,000.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.480]   So, I absolutely caused that person,
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.920]   that I said, "To me, you're a victim,
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.000]   "and I owe you that money."
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.360]   And it was a shitty thing to do,
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.600]   because even at the time, I was like,
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.780]   "Oh, they'll make a couple phone calls.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.880]   "It'll be fine."
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.720]   It wasn't fine.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.280]   And if I had really put any thought into it at all,
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.920]   I would have known it's gonna really affect these people.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.280]   And those people had done nothing wrong
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.520]   with the exception of trusting me.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.080]   They rented me their house,
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.200]   or they owner-financed their house.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.560]   They made the mistake of bumping into me,
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.360]   and now they owe $10,000, $20,000.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.800]   You know, and I'm sure a ton of anguish.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.380]   - So, what happened when you were caught that first time?
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.560]   - So, I was caught, and I got three years probation.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.480]   You know, I took the probation.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.520]   - What does that involve?
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.520]   - Initially, it was such a slap on the wrist.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.400]   - Were you allowed to still practice?
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.080]   - No, well, okay, so I wasn't.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.960]   I had to, I couldn't own the mortgage company anymore.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.840]   That was a good question, 'cause you would think,
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.320]   you know, "Wouldn't it be great if I could keep on going?"
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.360]   But what they said was, you know,
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.920]   "You have to forfeit your brokerage,
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:05.800]   "your brokerage license and your brokerage business license."
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.280]   And what I did was I transferred
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.520]   my brokerage business license
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.680]   to a guy that essentially bought my business.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.800]   They allowed me to work as a consultant
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.760]   in the mortgage industry.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.000]   You know, 'cause they went, you know, they go,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.740]   my lawyer goes to the judge and says,
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.560]   "What else can he do?"
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.560]   So, and so I have a friend, his name's Dave Walker.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.760]   He was a CPA.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   He came in and he bought my business
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.720]   and he paid me like $9,000 a month.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.760]   And that covered my bills.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   My wife and I got divorced.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.720]   So she's my ex-wife.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   And I don't know what to do, right?
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.720]   Like I don't, I'm, I could, you know,
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.400]   and I would say, you know, I could have like,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.840]   you know, you look back and it's like,
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.400]   I could have claimed bankruptcy.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.120]   I could have moved into my parents' spare room,
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.180]   you know, something like that.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.760]   But, you know, 'cause I had, I had,
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.320]   I lost everything in my divorce.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.480]   I had huge child support payment.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.240]   You know, not that that has anything to do
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.280]   like with my ex-wife.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.720]   Like I absolutely signed up for that.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.020]   Like I wanted to pay that.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.320]   But it was, it was, it was a chunk of change, you know?
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.880]   So we're talking about a couple thousand dollars a month
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.960]   for, you know, for child support.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.320]   She got all of the apartments that we had.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.160]   We had about a million,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.120]   million and a half dollars worth of apartments,
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.700]   which isn't a lot now,
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.160]   but that's probably a five or $6 million now.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.840]   So she got all the apartments.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.680]   So she got everything.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.960]   So now I'm sitting here like I can't be a mortgage broker.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.920]   I can get my $9,000,
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.920]   but I have to help this guy run this company,
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.680]   train people, do that sort of thing.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   So what I decided to do
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.000]   was I was gonna start flipping houses.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.280]   - Legitimately or not?
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.440]   - Well, initially I thought about doing it legitimately,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.280]   right?
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.180]   But at the same time,
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.240]   I was also in the middle of figuring out
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.240]   how to make these synthetic identities.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.620]   So I'm making the payments every month, remember?
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.200]   Two months in, three months, no, no credit scores,
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.600]   no credit scores, no credit scores.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.160]   And I'm also saying, I'm gonna go,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.200]   I'm gonna start buying houses, renovate them, sell them.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.780]   So the truth is we actually renovated
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.200]   probably one house completely.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.560]   I remember it was on 26th Street.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.920]   We renovated the house completely.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.800]   - On the outside and the inside?
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.080]   - Yeah, outside, inside, it's done, it's good.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.240]   - Okay, great.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.120]   - Me and this guy, actually Dave,
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.160]   Dave Walker, the guy that bought my business.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.240]   So we renovate it and it just so happens
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.100]   at the same time I go to pull credit one day
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:45.100]   and wow, 700 plus credit scores.
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:49.280]   And I went, we don't have to sell this thing at all.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.080]   Like we just, I can sell it and put it in this guy's name
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.000]   and let him refinance it.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.440]   And so that's what we did.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.640]   I ended up selling it to this synthetic identity.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.040]   - Do you remember the first synthetic identity, the name?
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.860]   - The first one was a Joel Colon.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.700]   - Yeah.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:06.520]   - And then I started getting creative
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.680]   because the ones after that I started naming.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.640]   So I had like Joel Colon and an Alan Duncan.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.200]   But then I, do you remember the movie Reservoir Dogs?
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.680]   So I started naming the characters
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.320]   after guys in the Reservoir Dogs.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.320]   So I had a James Redd, I had like a Michael White,
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.520]   Lee Black, I had a William Blue,
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.080]   David Silver, Brandon Green.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.520]   So then I start developing these guys.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.320]   Now I thought, oh, forget those normal things.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.560]   I'm going with these, with the Reservoir Dogs.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.000]   And I thought it was so cute too.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.400]   - You think in retrospect those are mistakes?
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.320]   - It was so stupid.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.340]   That was just, there's so many things,
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.460]   so many mistakes I made.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.240]   I mean, within the fraud there are mistakes I made,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.000]   but you know, other than just the overall committing fraud.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.120]   But it was just like, I thought it was so cute.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.560]   And then, you know, you get in front of the judge
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.720]   and the judge is hearing about the Reservoir Dogs
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:06.000]   and Mr. Green and Mr. Black, Mr. White, Mr. This, Mr. That.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.960]   And he's looking at me just like, you jackass.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.000]   Like, and you know, what am I saying?
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.560]   I'm like, yeah, I thought that was cute.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.920]   You know, but nothing's cute.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.340]   So, you know, plus I'm making fake banks.
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.780]   - What's the purpose of the fake banks?
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.400]   - Well, sometimes you have to have your down payment
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.720]   in the bank, right?
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.920]   So they want three months worth of bank statements
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.400]   to see that, hey, he's got his $50,000 in the bank.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.280]   And then the more properties you buy,
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.480]   they start to wanna see what's called reserves.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.920]   They wanna make sure that you can pay
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.700]   all your mortgage payments.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.000]   If this guy loses his job,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.560]   can this guy maintain all these mortgage payments
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.720]   for the next six months?
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.400]   And so they do that and they think you're gonna go,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.900]   you know, oh, no, he can't do it.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.280]   They go, well, then we won't lend it.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.560]   Well, when they do that to me, I go, of course I do.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.800]   Of course he's got it.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.620]   Let me send you over the bank statements.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.040]   Oh, you wanna call the bank?
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.240]   Call 'em.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.000]   - So there's a phone number, there's a website.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.520]   - Yes, you can call.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.360]   We'll get on there.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.880]   I'll do the whole shh, you know, and hold on.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.760]   Okay, what's the name again?
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   Do you have the account number?
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.060]   Shh, hold on.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.240]   You wait a little bit, you know, you come out.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.120]   Oh, okay, I got it here.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.960]   I can't tell you the exact amount right now,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.880]   but what was his balance last month in the data?
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.280]   Oh, yep, that's it, exactly.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.240]   Okay, thank you, click.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.200]   - Would you do different voices or would you be--
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.520]   - No, I've done different voices
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.920]   or I just have somebody else do it.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.120]   You know, Gretchen would have done it
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.720]   or one of the brokers, Susan would have done it,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.120]   one of the brokers that worked for me
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.080]   or, you know, Kelly or Johnny Moon.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.480]   I mean, I have so many guys and, you know,
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.640]   they just get on the phone and they do it
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.680]   'cause they're all doing something fraud
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.640]   and we're all working together.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.840]   So, hey, I need you to call this guy.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.080]   I need you to call this guy and verify this
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.760]   and say, oh, I'm at the bank.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.280]   Okay, I'm at the bank, okay, cool.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.520]   And they call back and--
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.280]   - Does this feel like an organized system
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.920]   or was it more improv,
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.000]   just like dealing with the different situations?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.680]   - The government would definitely say it was organized.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.680]   I would say it was, you know, you're a bunch of,
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.920]   you're just a bunch of guys, you know, to,
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.560]   you know, you're joking around with everybody
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.340]   and you're helping each other
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.680]   and it's not like everybody's, you know,
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.360]   kicking up the tommy, you know, so.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.460]   - So, and then all these new puzzles come up
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.920]   and you figure out ways to solve these puzzles.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.840]   - You go in and you say, hey, I've got this loan.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.880]   I need to get this loan
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.160]   and this guy's trying to buy this house
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.480]   and I need a loan that looks like this.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.800]   Where can we go?
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   And by the way, they cannot order a copy of his tax returns.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.100]   So, you don't want to have to sign what's called a 4506.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.660]   So, they're like, oh, okay, listen,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.840]   so-and-so's got a program that, you know,
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.680]   and you go back and forth,
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.240]   but you have to have this much in reserves,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.960]   but you got the bank, yeah, yeah, I got the bank,
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.800]   I could do that.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.560]   You know, so you go in and you throw it out there
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.760]   to five or six guys
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.500]   and you're gonna come up with an answer.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.880]   - So, you're on probation here, just to self-reflect.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.920]   Did you start doing this while on probation
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.720]   because of the money or because it gave you meaning?
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:03.840]   - God, you know, I mean, a big part of that, the reason,
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.360]   is I did not want to move back in with my parents
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.800]   and I didn't want my father to see me struggling
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.720]   and I didn't want him to,
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:21.000]   it was, my success, he had no idea.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.280]   My success had been the first time
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.920]   he'd ever really been proud of me.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.180]   Does that make sense? - Your financial success?
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.200]   - Yes. - At which point,
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.040]   what was the first time you told him you did something
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.480]   and he was like, you could sense him being proud?
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.080]   - Oh, when I became a mortgage broker.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.440]   When I became a mortgage broker
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.800]   and I went to work for the company,
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.840]   and we're talking about within a week,
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.560]   I got a client, three days later,
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.600]   I got a client, a week later, got a client,
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.560]   two days later, got a client,
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.880]   like I closed four loans my first month.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.920]   And my dad was like, well,
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.720]   well, how much money are you gonna make?
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.480]   And I'm like, oh, I'm charging this much, this,
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.240]   I got a point on the back, I got this,
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.560]   boom, I'm thinking I'm gonna walk home after taxes,
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.800]   like 10, 11,000.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.440]   Jesus, God Almighty, you know?
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.940]   Are you still, well, we'll see,
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.720]   don't start counting your chickens before that, you know?
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.660]   And then, you know, two, whatever, three weeks later,
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.540]   four weeks later, you know, boom, I got a check,
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:15.040]   it's like $9,000 or something.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.320]   And then, you know, the next month, it's 12,
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.400]   and the next month, it's 16,
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.640]   and then they make me a manager, and you know, it just--
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.800]   - He didn't know any of it was illegitimate.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.960]   - No, he thinks, he thinks, my son, he's brilliant.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.800]   You know, he's great, he's wonderful.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.040]   I had, you know, was certainly not proud of me
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.920]   prior to that, but you know, my dad was athletic,
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.920]   he was extremely bright, I mean, brilliant.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:50.440]   And I was a kid who had to be put into special schools,
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.320]   who barely graduated high school,
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.200]   who ended up going to college
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.520]   and getting a degree in fine arts,
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.440]   because I was never gonna be able
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.240]   to get a degree in business.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.600]   It wasn't gonna happen.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.880]   So when I graduated college,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.120]   I remember with the degree in fine arts,
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.360]   he said, "The best thing you could do with that
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.760]   "is maybe you could draw caricatures at Disney World."
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.440]   Which wasn't a compliment by any,
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.480]   it wasn't like, "Hey, you could draw."
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.360]   So yeah, he, you know, and then I turned around
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.200]   and I tried to go to work for State Farm Insurance,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.340]   which is who he worked for.
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:28.600]   He worked for them for like 40-something years.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.700]   And I failed the aptitude test.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.680]   So then I went and worked for another insurance company,
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.920]   and I was an insurance adjuster.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.600]   But I couldn't keep up with the workload.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.400]   And then I ended up working construction.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.920]   I'm still barely paying my bills.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.240]   You know, that's basically where my dad felt like,
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.720]   that's, you know, he was polite to me.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.400]   You know, we were, you know, cordial.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.520]   But yeah, I wasn't, I think he felt
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.960]   he deserved a better kid, so.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.780]   - Well, when you started doing mortgages,
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.840]   that's when he was like-- - Of course, he was like--
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.240]   - This kid's got something.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.760]   - I'm driving, I'm driving a new,
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.720]   I kinda just pulled in in a new car
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.520]   and I just bought a house that was, you know,
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.000]   four or five blocks away from his house,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.460]   from where I grew up, from where he lived at that time.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:20.680]   Six blocks away from where my sister's married
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.580]   to her lawyer husband.
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:25.000]   Like, I'm doing pretty good.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.880]   And then within three months, we bought,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   you know, my new wife, we buy a quadplex,
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.080]   and then we're buying a triplex, and another quadplex,
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.520]   and a 10 unit, and a duplex, and another duplex,
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.960]   and a quadplex, and it's like,
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.880]   what the hell's going on, this guy is blowing up.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.680]   He's going on vacation here, and vacation here,
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.480]   and you know, so he, you know,
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.920]   and so when the FBI comes in and they indict me
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.480]   and I take the three years probation,
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.120]   like, I mean, probably the worst thing in the world,
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.700]   you know, other than going to prison,
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.840]   would have been just having to just sell everything
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.700]   and go move in and start over and sell used cars.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.120]   Not that there's anything wrong with selling used cars,
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.760]   but I just felt like, you know,
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.480]   I just didn't want to disappoint him
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.200]   any more than I already had.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.480]   So I thought, I'm gonna flip houses
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.240]   and then I'll start maybe a development company,
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.640]   so I'll buy some vacant lots and all this and that.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:21.840]   The problem is, these houses I'm buying for 50,000,
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.800]   if I fix them up and sell them, maybe I make 20, 25,000,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.320]   and then you gotta find a qualified borrower.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.440]   It's very hard to find a qualified borrower
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.480]   that wants to live in Ybor City.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.080]   Back then, it's, I still think it's rough,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.200]   but those same houses are going for three and 400,000.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.320]   So, you know, I'm buying houses,
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.360]   I gotta get qualified borrowers,
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.960]   I have to do all the renovations.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.440]   It's a nightmare, you know?
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.600]   And if I, you know, looking back, it's like,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.120]   okay, well, then you gotta bite the bullet.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.320]   It's just what you have to do.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.800]   I didn't want to do that.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.320]   I didn't want to do it, whether it was laziness
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:03.000]   or I don't know, you know, I just thought I'm good at this,
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.040]   I'm gonna run, I'm just gonna start running a scam.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.200]   I'm gonna figure out how to drive the prices up,
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.520]   buy the houses for 50, record them at 200,000,
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.160]   and then have these synthetic identities,
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.720]   buy all the properties, refinance them,
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.160]   pull out the cash, make six months worth of payments,
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.280]   let them all go into foreclosure.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.280]   And that really, really started working well, very well.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.400]   I had one time where I had a guy, it was James Redd,
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.120]   the synthetic identity was James Redd,
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.720]   and he had bought two or three houses.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.040]   And there was somebody at the office
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.800]   who was friends of somebody who knew the title company
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.560]   where we were closing the loans.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.200]   And he called her, her name was Mary, and said,
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.760]   "Mary, this guy James Redd,
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:51.200]   "like Cox is doing something shady,
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.840]   "James Redd doesn't even exist."
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.940]   She goes and looks at the file, her last couple files,
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.200]   and she realizes, of course, obviously,
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.840]   like this guy never showed up.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.340]   She remembers Cox picked up the files,
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.520]   like, and he's saying he doesn't exist.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.840]   So she freaks out.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.760]   She calls the mortgage broker, mortgage broker calls me,
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.840]   mortgage broker calls me up and says,
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:15.740]   "Listen, Mary said she's not closing the next loan
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:17.340]   "unless James Redd shows up."
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:22.240]   And I went, "Wow, that's a tough one."
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.600]   And she's like, "Okay, so what do you wanna do?
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.760]   "Do you wanna go to another title company?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   "We're supposed to close in like three days, two, three days."
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.240]   I said, "Well, I mean, he's gonna have to show up then."
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.880]   I said, "I'll figure it out, give me a couple days,
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.720]   "let me figure this out."
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.920]   And she's like, "Okay, well, I don't know
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.720]   "how that's gonna happen, he doesn't exist."
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.680]   Keep in mind, at this point, I don't need IDs.
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.160]   I don't need a real ID.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.320]   I mean, I figured out how to kind of make a real ID, right?
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.800]   Like I could make one, I could take sandpaper
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.240]   and sand off the information on a regular ID,
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   and then I would print the corrected information in reverse
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:59.680]   on a piece of transparency, and I would glue it over there.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.560]   And you could still see the holograms and stuff.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.240]   It actually worked pretty good.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.120]   I don't know, a cop's not gonna,
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.780]   it's not gonna pass mustard with a cop,
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.920]   but somebody at the bank, like I was able to go in
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.620]   and I would open a bank account with it.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:16.080]   Well, so one of the things I had done
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.080]   when I was closing these loans was I would go online
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:26.120]   and I would pick, you have to pick a photo of somebody,
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.040]   right, to put on the driver's license, right?
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.040]   So I'm not making a fake ID for all these guys
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.640]   'cause I don't need a fake ID for all these guys,
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   not with my picture on it, but I need a fake,
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.080]   I need a copy of an ID, but I need a picture.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.280]   Where do I get the picture?
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:44.640]   So I go to Hillsborough County's arrest website,
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.640]   and I would find people that I knew that had been arrested.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:53.540]   And so I found a guy named Eric Tamargo
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.920]   who had been arrested.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.760]   He had like, I don't know what it was,
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.160]   the DUI or domestic violence, I forget what it was,
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.960]   but there was a picture of him.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.820]   So I print out the picture, I cut it up,
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.700]   I paste it onto a driver's license,
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:11.160]   and I make a copy of it for James Redd.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.220]   That's what I'd been giving the title people.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.940]   When I would close, I'd sign all the documents
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.220]   and I'd leave them that copy
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:19.500]   so that it looked like they made a copy of it.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.180]   And then they would notarize all the documents,
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.460]   even though they'd never seen this person,
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.720]   they have a copy of his driver's license,
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.340]   everything's signed, Cox said he signed it, it's good.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.820]   Notarized, here's your check.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.340]   So what I do is I think,
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.600]   let me see if I can get Eric to do this.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.620]   I knew he'd been to prison before.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.100]   So I call up Eric, and I remember one of my buddies,
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.940]   like, he's never gonna do this.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.960]   And I was like, I think he will, I think he will.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.920]   So that's how, and that's really that kind of like,
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.700]   you think, what do you think?
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.020]   Let me try, let me call him.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.140]   I don't know, bro.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:55.140]   Like, that's the kind of conversations you're having.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:55.980]   But really looking back--
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.540]   - I would love to hear the opener few sentences
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.980]   that you have with him.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.660]   - I got, I can tell you exactly what I said,
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.300]   'cause it's burned in my mind.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.900]   He comes in, so what Eric was doing at that time,
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.080]   he was actually working for us.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:07.920]   He worked for somebody else,
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.420]   but periodically we'd buy a house and we'd call him up.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:14.340]   We'd say, hey, can you, you and your boss,
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.740]   can you guys come over and trim the trees of this house?
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.200]   Trim all the trees, take all the crap in the yard,
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.040]   clean it up.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.140]   They go, yeah, sure, no problem.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:21.980]   'Cause that's what he did,
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:23.280]   worked for like a handyman service.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.980]   So they would come and they'd clean it up and they'd do that.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.940]   So I say, can you come over?
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.780]   And he goes like, yeah.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.900]   So he comes to the office, whatever, a few hours later,
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.380]   and he comes in the conference room.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.100]   I said, hey, Eric, what's going on?
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.940]   And he says, hey, how's it going?
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.580]   I said, yeah, I said, listen, I said,
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.100]   I'm gonna tell you something.
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:39.920]   I need a favor.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:40.820]   He's like, okay, cool.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.500]   He's like, what is it?
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.580]   I said, you know all these houses
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:46.500]   we've been having you go and clean up?
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.460]   He's like, yeah, you painted that one house.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.300]   You did this.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.460]   Right, so here's what we've been doing.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:53.860]   I've been buying these houses for $50,000,
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.300]   recording them for 200.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.940]   And then I have these fake people buy them.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.620]   And I explain, I just lay it out for him.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.220]   And he's like, wow.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.220]   That's, he's like, that's, fuck it, bro.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.300]   That's ingenious, man.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.460]   That's smart.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.940]   Like, oh, I was like, okay.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:08.980]   I said, yeah, I know, that's great.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.300]   So here's the thing.
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.780]   I said, the title company who's been closing
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.660]   some of these loans, we have a closing in a couple days.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.420]   She wants this guy, James Redd, to show up.
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.180]   And I need someone to show up as James Redd.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:24.140]   And he goes, wow.
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.660]   He goes, who are you gonna get to do that?
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.060]   And I was just thinking, (laughs)
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.220]   just like, you're not understanding.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:33.260]   I'm not confiding in you 'cause I need a friend, you know?
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.420]   So, and I looked at him, I said,
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.700]   oh, I was thinking you might do it.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:39.380]   He was like, whoa, 'cause that's a big favor.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.540]   I said, it is a big favor.
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:41.780]   I could be in a lot of trouble.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.620]   And I said, I know.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.260]   And he goes, well, wait a minute.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.820]   He goes, I can't go.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.700]   He said, you have to give these people a driver's license.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:52.220]   You said the driver's license is you were using mugshots.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.020]   She, you said she's closed a couple of these.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.940]   She already, she's seen this guy's picture.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.620]   And I go, she has seen his picture.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.520]   I said, the thing is for James Redd,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.100]   I pulled the mugshot offline of you
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.020]   when you were arrested a couple of years ago.
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:09.700]   And he jumps up and he goes, you motherfucker.
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.580]   And I go, oh, I said, Eric, I said,
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.100]   wait a minute, I said, hold on, hold on.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.660]   I said, listen, I said, I only did that
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.620]   because I knew if it came down to this moment,
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.500]   you were the only person that I knew
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.580]   that could pull this off,
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.100]   that'd have the balls to walk in and do it.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.540]   And he sat there and he went,
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:27.260]   yeah, you're right, you're right.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.100]   And I mean, I couldn't believe he fell.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.900]   Listen, this guy would beat the brakes off me.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.300]   He was, he's like 5'10", 5'11".
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:39.220]   He's boxed, he's a big guy.
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.140]   So, it's like I've weathered that part of the storm.
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.420]   And he sat there and he goes, right, right.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.340]   And he goes, well, I'm not doing it for free.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.180]   I'm not doing it for nothing.
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.100]   I said, no, bro, of course not.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.260]   I mean, what are you like, you're making a lot of money.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.100]   I said, well, keep in mind,
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.940]   a lot of that money goes back in the property.
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.840]   It's not like we're walking away with,
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.100]   I think I said like tens of thousands,
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:58.140]   we're really walking away with hundreds of thousands.
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.900]   It's not like we're walking away with a bunch of money
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.820]   or we gotta buy more properties.
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:04.580]   We gotta keep it going, we gotta make the payments.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.260]   No, I know, but still I could get in a lot of trouble.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.700]   I said, I understand, bro.
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.660]   I go, well, what do you want?
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:10.620]   And I remember thinking,
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.900]   if he asked for more than like 10 or 15,000,
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.860]   like, I'll just, I'll do it myself.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.660]   We'll just change title companies and we'll go
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.340]   and I'll do it myself.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:24.340]   And he sat there and he went, I want $500.
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:26.660]   And I went, $500?
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:28.020]   Listen, I almost started laughing.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.740]   I mean, I was like, I put my hand over my,
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.660]   I was like, $500?
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.860]   It's gonna take you 30 minutes.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.440]   And he's like, I don't care, bro.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.280]   I get in a lot of trouble.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.860]   I was like, oh, well, yeah, I'm not paying you now.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:40.420]   You gotta sign first.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.420]   And he's like, oh, you know, I'll sign, I'll sign.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:43.740]   I know you're good for it.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.660]   Bro, he did it for 500 bucks.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.060]   I made a fake ID for him.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.900]   He goes in to the place, he signs James Redd.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:55.180]   Comes out, what was funny about that was
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.340]   when we walked into the title company,
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:01.140]   we're sitting in the lobby and Mary comes walking out.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.700]   She looks at me, she goes, Mr. Cox,
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:03.980]   I don't know why you're here.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.980]   She goes, I told Kelly, that was the broker.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:10.580]   She goes, I told the broker that I'm not closing the loan
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:13.220]   unless James Redd shows up.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:16.140]   And Eric stands up on cue and he goes, I'm James Redd.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.700]   And she was like, and she goes, hold on a second.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.500]   She runs in the back, comes back with a file,
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.940]   opens it up, looks at the picture, and she's like,
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.660]   oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.820]   Give me five minutes, I've got the file.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.540]   Prints up the docs, he goes in, signs.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.220]   And when we're there, she's passing out the checks.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:39.220]   5,000 here, 25,000 here, 35,000 here, 7,000 here, 6,000 here.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:42.820]   So he sees all these checks and I'm like,
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.100]   oh, I got that, I know the construction company.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.220]   No, no, no, I have that, I'll take care of that,
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.060]   I'll take care of that.
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.120]   So I get all the checks and I leave.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.200]   We go sit in my Audi and he sits down and he's like,
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:54.040]   bro, that's a lot of money.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.020]   A lot of that money goes back into the properties, Eric.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:59.060]   And he's like, ah, still, bro.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:02.860]   And I said, and I counted out 500 bucks.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.900]   But listen, a week later, we had another closing.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:09.100]   So he comes in, I said, hey, bro.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.380]   He's like, hey, what's going on?
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.580]   And I said, I need you to do the James Red thing.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.140]   He goes, yeah, I've been thinking about that.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.220]   I did that way too cheap.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:19.940]   I said, I get it, man.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.100]   How much do you want, what do you want?
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:24.660]   And I'm thinking, if it's more than 10 or 15,
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.300]   I'll do it myself.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:29.860]   And he sits there and he goes, I want $1,000.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:34.040]   I go, $1,000, like, oh my God.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.380]   So I gave him $1,000 and he did another one.
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:41.740]   But by that point, it was like five or six.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.180]   We'd done five or six with that guy.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:45.340]   And after five or six, plus the credit cards,
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:47.460]   plus all the other things,
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:49.740]   their credit scores start dropping.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.060]   If it was 700, now it's down to like 600.
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:54.740]   And at 600, you couldn't really borrow enough
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:55.700]   to make it worth it.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.220]   It's like, and I have other people in the wings waiting.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:02.660]   So we would just, I'd go out and I'd run up
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.500]   the credit cards and pull all the money out of the banks
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.820]   and close the accounts and then stop paying.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.300]   - And you said a lot of people knew.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.100]   So he was one of the people that--
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.660]   - He was one of the people.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.100]   - Why do you think nobody said anything?
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:20.100]   - Well, I mean, I think everybody was making money.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:22.340]   The appraiser, at that time, I had an appraiser.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.820]   Eventually, I ordered the appraisal software
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.540]   and I just start doing the appraisals myself.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.300]   Like, why give this guy 500 bucks?
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:31.300]   - So you were doing the appraisal yourself.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.140]   - Bro, I'm doing the appraisal.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:33.100]   - How's that possible?
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.860]   How's that, is there a check against it?
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.300]   Is there a--
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.140]   - There is, it's just funny.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.540]   Nobody ever questions that.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.220]   You actually have to have a license
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.460]   to get the appraisal software.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.860]   So I get an appraiser that we're working with.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.100]   I get her license.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:55.180]   And I create an email address as her.
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:59.860]   - So it was a synthetic appraiser.
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.340]   - Right, it was a real person.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.100]   But I end up ordering the appraisal software
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:09.100]   by emailing, it was called Alamo, Alamo Appraisal Software.
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:13.660]   So I end up emailing them as her.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.860]   And they go, well, we can't sell you the software
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.620]   unless we need a copy of your license.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.980]   Boom, here's your license.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:21.780]   So I send them the license,
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.540]   and then we paid for it with a credit card.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.340]   You could go get like a Green Dot card.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.500]   You go put 500 bucks on it, or 1,000.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.940]   The software was like 1,500 bucks or something.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.220]   So you could give them like back then,
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.060]   you know, it was a long time ago.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:35.780]   So 1,500 bucks, they mail it to us,
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.380]   and now I've got the software.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.100]   So now I can do the appraisals myself.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:43.180]   - What stops you from appraising it,
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.300]   not for 200,000, but even more?
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.220]   - There's no comparable sales.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.340]   So no matter what you sent to the bank,
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:50.520]   they're gonna look at it.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.100]   Like they're gonna have, their in-house appraiser
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.860]   is going to do a desktop review.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.420]   He's gonna go online, he's gonna check
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:01.660]   to make sure all of the comparable sales
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.420]   are sold for what you said they sold for,
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.260]   are the same square footage, were built,
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.380]   what the pictures look like, how far they are.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.460]   He's gonna double check everything.
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.340]   But you know, he's some guy who's on salary,
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:13.500]   and he does, you know, whatever,
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.260]   40 or 50 of these a day or something.
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.660]   It doesn't take him long.
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:18.740]   And so it's cheaper that way,
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.020]   where we pay for the appraisals, the whole thing.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:22.860]   - Got it.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:23.980]   So everybody's getting paid.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.820]   - Right.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.980]   And so at this point, I'm doing that, right?
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:30.140]   You know, and I'm getting caught periodically.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.300]   - Can you give an example?
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:32.620]   What do you mean getting caught?
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:35.260]   - I'm living in Tampa Heights,
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.340]   which is right next to Ybor City in Tampa, right?
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:40.420]   So this is all, these are all like little suburbs of Tampa,
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.540]   and they're all built back in the 1920s, right?
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.980]   1890s, 1910, 1920.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:48.660]   So I've bought this eight unit building.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.780]   I renovated it into a triplex.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:52.660]   I mean, I'm driving an Audi.
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:56.740]   I'm dating a woman that I should not have been dating.
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.260]   Like, I mean, I don't know what she was thinking.
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.260]   So I'm, you know, we were going on vacations.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.460]   Like everything, life's good.
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:06.220]   So, but every once in a while, you know,
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.780]   like where, you know, where things happen,
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.620]   you get a phone call.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.180]   Hey, this is what just happened.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:15.660]   And I, one time I got a phone call from same broker, Kelly.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.260]   Kelly calls me up and said, listen, we got a problem.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:23.020]   This was, I want to say this was Alan Duncan.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.940]   This was one of the first ones that I had done, right?
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.460]   We used him, but, and so he,
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:32.980]   so she calls me up and says, listen,
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:37.420]   Alan Duncan never made his first mortgage payment.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:42.640]   And I had a friend of mine, or one of my co-defendants,
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.420]   when we closed on that loan,
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:51.540]   we both got checks for whatever, 40 or 50 grand.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.020]   Keep in mind, we're also buying,
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.580]   some of this money's going into a business account.
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:57.140]   We're buying property.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:59.420]   We're buying, so it's not like I'm pocketing
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:02.380]   hundreds of thousands of dollars or even, you know,
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:05.220]   even 20 or $30,000 on every closing.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.540]   I'm more like, I'm getting 25, 10, 20,
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.860]   and this guy's getting 10 and this guy's getting 15.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:13.740]   And then we're taking 60
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.140]   and we're putting it into the business account.
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.500]   We're buying a bunch of vacant lots
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.940]   or we're building some new houses.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:20.100]   So we're trying to kind of take all this
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.100]   and turn it into a development company.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:25.440]   But we still have to pay our bills.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.500]   So, you know, my buddy's got to go to,
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.580]   he's got to go to Amsterdam at least for two weeks.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.360]   You know, he's from Belgium.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.480]   That's, you apparently have to do that at least once a year.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.340]   So he was, so when I gave him his check,
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.260]   I said, look, you're going to make the,
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.940]   here's the like 20 grand or 15 grand,
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.300]   but you got to make the payments on this thing
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.140]   for the next six months.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.140]   He was, no problem.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.600]   I said, okay.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.300]   So she calls me up a month and a half later and says,
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:55.300]   hey, Alan Duncan did not make his first payment.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.300]   And I went, oh my God.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:01.220]   And he was actually renting the apartment downstairs from me.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:04.060]   So I run downstairs and I opened the door and I go, bro,
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.100]   I'm like, did you make Duncan's payment?
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:07.860]   And he turns around and he's like, is it due?
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.300]   And I was like, oh my God.
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.900]   So I run back, you know, I grabbed the phone.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.740]   I'm like, he didn't make it.
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.560]   He didn't make it.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.820]   She's like, okay, well, here's what's happening.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.400]   The account executive is calling.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.100]   They've got the file and it was called,
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.820]   it was Southstar Bank.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.180]   Southstar Bank has it.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.260]   They reviewed it.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.100]   They've already been ordering documents.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.480]   They're saying that this guy, there's a problem.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.220]   They are, it's falling apart.
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:31.060]   Like the whole thing's falling.
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.440]   They know something's wrong.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:33.700]   - But they don't know exactly what.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.360]   There's just something suspicious.
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.060]   - She didn't tell me that on the phone.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.820]   Like she's saying there's something wrong.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.900]   They're freaking out.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.600]   'Cause the account executive didn't really know.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.300]   She just got a phone call saying, hey,
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.260]   have you ever met this broker?
[01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:46.460]   Did she meet the guy?
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:47.380]   Who is the guy?
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:48.200]   He hasn't paid.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.040]   We're calling the cell.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.220]   Nobody's answering.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:53.920]   And really most of this was my buddy Rudy's fault.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.100]   He's not doing any of this stuff.
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:56.580]   He, any of the things he's supposed to be doing.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:00.740]   So we go to the office and I call Southstar Bank.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.460]   I get the secretary and I said, look,
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:06.180]   I need to talk to whatever the guy, the big guy was.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.380]   It was one of them was like the president.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.780]   One was like the somebody else, anyway, vice president.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.020]   So I said, I need to talk to so-and-so, the vice president.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.420]   She says, I'm sorry, he's in a business meeting.
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.780]   I said, well, listen, tell him this is Alan Duncan.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.780]   Like you need to go tell him
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.140]   is Alan Duncan's on the phone right now.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.820]   I'm sure you, he wants to talk to me.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:25.420]   And she's like, all right, hold on.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:30.300]   And I mean like 20 seconds later, speakerphone.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:34.040]   Hey, Mr. Duncan, this is so-and-so.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.280]   And I'm here with our lawyer and the president of the bank
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.160]   and our head of fraud.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.920]   We were just discussing you.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.600]   And I was like, okay.
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.320]   I understand that you guys, I haven't made my first payment.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.560]   I said, it actually came back in the mail.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.520]   I had the wrong address.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.360]   That was completely my fault and I apologize.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.520]   I said, but I can get you a cashier's check today.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:57.640]   I will overnight it, no problem.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.600]   Hope that's gonna be okay.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.480]   I said, they said, wait, we're way past that.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.920]   Way past that.
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.560]   I said, okay, well, what's the issue?
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.380]   And they were like, I mean, look, to be honest,
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:11.000]   I don't think I'm talking to Alan Duncan.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.200]   I don't think there is an Alan Duncan.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.780]   He's like, I mean, your social security number
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.480]   was issued a couple of years ago.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:20.120]   We called the bank and this was why we had gone
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.120]   with like South or SunTrust Bank, right?
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.100]   So it was a real bank.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.440]   So it wasn't our normal bank.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.240]   And they called, they don't have any record of you.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.500]   And I was like, well, I've never been happy
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.240]   with South Star Bank there.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.800]   It sounds like a banking error.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.440]   And they're like, yeah, I don't think this isn't cute.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.440]   He says, I don't think I'm talking to Alan Duncan right now.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.280]   Right.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.100]   And you were--
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.360]   Terrified, terrified.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.440]   But you'll have to be playing it cool, I guess.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:49.880]   I mean, I know, what am I gonna say?
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.840]   No, you're talking to Matt Cox.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:51.980]   Like, I can't say that.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.360]   Like, I'm just gotta keep running with it.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.240]   Just like, okay, well, look.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.120]   And he's like, we called the DMV.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.720]   They don't have a list of you in their website.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.200]   We think that the, you know, we don't think you exist.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.800]   You know, we're still waiting for a phone call back
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.560]   from who, so and so, and so, and so, and so.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.320]   And I'm just like, oh my God.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.920]   And I said, have you called the authorities yet?
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.120]   And they were like, no, we haven't.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.520]   But once we put our file together, we will.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.960]   And then the head of the fraud department,
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.560]   they said, oh, by the way, Mr., I forget his name,
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.720]   but the head of the fraud department,
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.680]   worked for the FBI for like 10 years or something,
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.680]   or 12 years.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:35.600]   And so, I mean, I'm just like,
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.140]   and by the way, the broker is there,
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:42.180]   and my buddy Rudy is there.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:44.960]   And I mean, he's pacing the room.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.520]   She's in tears, crying.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.480]   And I'm like, okay, well, fellas,
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.960]   I say, where's this headed?
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.800]   Where's this going?
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.080]   What are we doing?
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.920]   And so, they're kind of chuckling and joking about it.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:59.520]   And I remember being like thinking, what's the deal?
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.960]   Like, it's weird.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.720]   And I said, look, why don't I just,
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:06.520]   let me just pay you back.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.080]   They said, ah, we'll get the money.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:08.920]   We're not worried about it.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.320]   I said, you don't seem worried about the money,
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.080]   about getting any of the money back.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.360]   Like, why don't you just let me,
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.200]   I'll cut you a check.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.020]   I can get you the money back.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.920]   Like, I owed him like 150 or something.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.760]   I forget exactly.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.600]   It was nothing.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:19.440]   Like, I owe you 150,000.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:22.000]   Let me cut your check for 150,000.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.480]   And they were like, no, no, you know,
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:26.360]   that's, we'll get the money back
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.280]   when we foreclose on the property.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.440]   And that's when I was like, oh.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:36.480]   They think the property's worth like $195,000 or something.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.200]   And I went, oh, I said, I understand.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.960]   Okay, so do you have the appraisal in front of you?
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.160]   And they were like, yeah.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:44.160]   And I said, open it up.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.600]   I said, take a look at comp number one.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.720]   That's owned by a guy named, you know, Lee Black.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.000]   Comp number two, you know, is owned by, you know,
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.400]   whatever, David Silver, whatever the names were.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.120]   And I'm like, you know, like, black, silver, red.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.720]   I said, I am all those people.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.160]   And I said, let me tell you what I've done.
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:08.140]   And I tell him, just lay it out, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:11.860]   I said, so you can call the FBI,
[01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:13.720]   but you're not gonna get all your money back.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.420]   Or you can let me give you your money back.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.120]   And we can let this, we let sleeping dogs lie.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.220]   The whole thing goes away.
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.100]   I apologize.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:28.940]   You know, I had every intention of making all the payments.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:29.780]   It's a glitch.
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:30.620]   You caught me.
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:31.460]   No, my bad.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:34.160]   And so these guys are all just like, oh my God.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.180]   Like now they're, they put me on hold.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.380]   They're looking through the file.
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:38.620]   They come back.
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:40.900]   And I remember at some point we go back, forth, back, forth.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.700]   And finally they come back and they said, listen,
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.340]   you still have the money?
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:45.180]   I said, yeah.
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:46.860]   Well, first they come back, they threatened me.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.460]   Oh, well, when we give us to the FBI, you're.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.300]   I said, that's not true.
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.300]   I said, the money was deposited into a bank account.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.300]   It has since been moved.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.380]   The bank account has been closed.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.780]   It's been removed in cash.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.780]   That money is gone.
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.260]   You will never see that money.
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.100]   I will be cutting you.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.700]   If I pay you back at all, it'll be from another account.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:06.640]   And so the FBI agent ends up saying he's right.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.640]   Even if we caught him red handed,
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.580]   the likelihood that any of these funds
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.020]   will be ever be recouped is zero.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.700]   Like there's almost no money's ever recouped.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.620]   And so we end up, they put me on hold again.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:22.800]   They come back and they go,
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.780]   how quickly can you get us a cashier's check?
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:29.620]   And I go, like that day I go, get them a cashier's check.
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.060]   Overnight, the cashier's check.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:34.100]   They never called the FBI.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.060]   They never did anything.
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:38.260]   Now at that point, we actually ditched that whole,
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:41.300]   that James or Alan Duncan.
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.420]   I remember at that point we went to the mall,
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:45.540]   ran up all the credit cards and just threw everything away
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:48.700]   and walked away because it was shot.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.980]   You know, that whole, that guy was shot.
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:51.760]   I think we borrowed whatever,
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:54.180]   $800,000 or 900,000 in his name.
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:57.140]   - With the banks, it's really, really all about the money.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.500]   - Listen, when I go on the run,
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:01.380]   I got one where I was caught so red handed,
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.220]   it's insane how bad it was.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.420]   And listen, that's nothing.
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:10.300]   I got caught by Washington Mutual one time.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.740]   I was caught by Washington Mutual
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:16.740]   where we had done six owner-occupied duplexes.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:19.940]   So if you say you're gonna live in a house,
[01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:22.660]   you can get about 95% financing.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.240]   But if it's an investment property,
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.420]   you gotta put down 20%.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.540]   You get about 80% financing.
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:32.540]   So a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's deputy,
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:35.620]   we had his wife buy,
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:40.940]   I'm gonna say six owner-occupied duplexes
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.140]   saying she lived in every single one of 'em.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:47.620]   Well, you can't owner-occupy six dwellings.
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.840]   Like, that's fraud.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:51.780]   Now, granted, her W-2s and pay stubs were correct,
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.340]   but she didn't put the down payments down.
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.700]   Even the down payments we didn't put down.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.700]   We actually got cash back.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:00.900]   But months later, they called a lawyer
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:05.900]   from Washington Mutual ends up calling the mortgage broker
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.540]   and saying that they ended up with two
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.980]   of the owner-occupied duplexes
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:18.980]   because Washington Mutual had a credit line extended
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:21.460]   to one of the lenders who'd lent the money.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.600]   So it actually was Washington Mutual.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.260]   So it was a couple months later when they went to sell it,
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:28.520]   and they packaged 'em together and sell 'em,
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.540]   they realized we have the same customer
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:34.080]   with two duplexes side-by-side, both owner-occupied.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.300]   This is fraud.
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:36.780]   So she comes in, she tells me,
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.900]   "Oh, my gosh, this lawyer's on the phone.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.740]   "This is what happened."
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.740]   I'm like, "Oh, wow, this is horrible."
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:43.540]   I end up getting on the phone with him.
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.640]   We have a conversation, and he's like,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.220]   "Look, this is a big deal.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:49.460]   "We could call the FBI."
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.860]   I'm like, "Look, who knows who was involved in this?
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:53.500]   "Maybe somebody on your side was involved.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:54.640]   "Maybe somebody on my side.
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:56.160]   "I don't know what my mortgage broker did.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.780]   "I'll deal with her on my own.
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:00.780]   "Why don't you just let us refinance the properties?"
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.660]   Not only did we talk him into allowing us
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:08.660]   to refinance the properties, he gave us a reduced balance
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:15.500]   of what we owed him, because we couldn't borrow enough
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:16.940]   to pay him off.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.700]   So they took like a $20,000 hit
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:22.780]   just to refinance those properties.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.420]   Never called the FBI.
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.480]   Never did anything.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.180]   Absolutely fraud.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.780]   Yeah, I had a broker one time we got called
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:31.140]   with over a million dollars in loans
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.040]   that he had done that were fraudulent.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:37.480]   Pinnacle Bank Corp., which was out of Chicago,
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.300]   the owner called me, and he was like,
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:41.840]   "Look, your mortgage broker did this."
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:44.600]   There was a bunch of canceled checks.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.200]   They were fake canceled checks.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.080]   So they looked like they had run through the bank
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.560]   for somebody's rent, but they hadn't.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:52.900]   Does that make sense?
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.800]   You pay your rent, they deposit it, it goes to the bank,
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.200]   and they've got all the numbers and everything.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.000]   Well, I had a bunch that were blank
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.480]   that all you had to do was fill out
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.520]   your borrower's information,
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.960]   and then you cut and pasted his name and his address
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.120]   at the upper left-hand corner.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.080]   You make a copy of it.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.120]   It looks like canceled checks.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:11.360]   We had 24 of them.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.000]   Well, one of my brokers was using them for all of his files.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.080]   Even if the person really had a rental history,
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.000]   he didn't wanna order it.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.920]   He just did this.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.760]   It was easier.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.580]   It's faster, yeah.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.060]   Yeah, just-- Wow.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:24.700]   So they catch a million dollars worth of loans.
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.240]   They call me up, and then they caught another million dollars
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:31.720]   but they had already sold them to Household Bank.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.160]   So while I'm on the phone with the owner, his name's Gary,
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.440]   and we're talking, he's like, look, this is what we found,
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.920]   this is this, this is what happened.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:42.000]   And I remember I said, Gary, at the end of this conversation,
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.720]   if you think I'm cutting you a check for a million dollars,
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.200]   I said, I just don't have it.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.560]   I don't have it.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.600]   And this was when I owned the mortgage company.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:53.600]   And he says, no, I'm asking you for your word
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:57.680]   that if any of these come back on us,
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.820]   they're in Florida, they're in your area,
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.720]   you'll help us get rid of the properties.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.640]   We'll foreclose, we're gonna have to resell 'em,
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.040]   I don't wanna be flying down there,
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.920]   just help us get rid of 'em.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.880]   I said, absolutely, of course, no problem.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.080]   I said, what about the, I said,
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:11.960]   well, what are you gonna do with them?
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.320]   He goes, well, they're gonna be a part of a package,
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.440]   like a $3 million package we're selling to Household Bank.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.840]   The other ones they had caught had already been sold.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.840]   The ethical thing to do is to contact Household Bank,
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.440]   say, we will buy those back,
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.680]   we are gonna take care of, it's not what happened.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:31.480]   In fact, Gary flew down a couple weeks later,
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.160]   took me and several of the brokers, not that broker,
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.880]   but several of the brokers out to dinner,
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.840]   had a few drinks, and he openly admitted,
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.920]   he's like, look, I don't care
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.800]   if all the loans have fraud in 'em,
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.740]   as long as they don't come back on me,
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.200]   that's what I'm concerned about.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.400]   'Cause there's a clawback clause for one year.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.440]   He's like, so if they can perform for one year,
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.740]   I don't care.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.520]   That was it.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.080]   - How many people in the industry
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:00.320]   do you think are operating like this?
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:07.120]   And by like this, I mean in the aforementioned gray area?
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:13.640]   - I would say there's probably after the,
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.680]   like after the 2008 financial crisis,
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:21.040]   I would say it cleaned up considerably,
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.600]   but I would say at this point,
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:25.520]   it's just as bad as it ever was.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:27.280]   And keep in mind these, a lot of the loans
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.280]   that caused the problems were,
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.720]   like they called them liar loans,
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.720]   or no-qualification, no-qual loans, right?
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.000]   No income.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.120]   Well, those loans, they exist again.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.160]   Like there are subprime companies
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.200]   that are doing that again.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.400]   They don't think they call 'em subprime anymore,
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.440]   they call 'em so they got some other name.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:54.280]   - Yeah, rebranded.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.560]   - Yeah, they've rebranded a little bit,
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.540]   but it's happening all over again.
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:03.720]   - It just seems the whole real estate/banking system
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.580]   is very prone to this kind of corruption.
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:10.320]   - I mean, but how can you fix it?
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.960]   Like if, a lot of the things they fixed,
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.600]   a lot of the manipulation they fixed,
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:19.440]   but if you tighten it too much,
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.520]   then the average person can't get a loan.
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:26.600]   And the thing is, some of these loans,
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.340]   sometimes changing a W-2,
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:31.200]   should that person have gotten into that house?
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.020]   No, he shouldn't have, he didn't qualify.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.940]   But he makes all of his payments.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:37.200]   So it's like, is it a fraudulent loan?
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.040]   Yeah, but it performs.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.460]   So I think that, I would say that,
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.360]   I forget what the FBI statistic was,
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:50.360]   it was like 20% or 30% prior to the financial crisis,
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.400]   it was like 20 or 30% of bank loans,
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.600]   they were saying that contained some kind of fraud,
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.720]   even if it was just a lie.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.720]   If you wanna cut 30% out of the, that's a ton, that's a ton.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:06.680]   - So you're on probation, and you're doing these,
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.500]   you're almost getting caught, you're almost getting caught,
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.300]   and you're doing these really large scale scams.
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:17.760]   How does it get to the point where you're on the run?
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:21.160]   - So, I'm doing multiple scams, right?
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:23.100]   So it's not just that I'm doing the scams
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.700]   with the Reservoir Dog scams, right?
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:27.120]   I'm not just doing those guys.
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:32.120]   I'm also creating other identities,
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.160]   because I've got other people that are involved,
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.360]   they wanna do a scam.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:41.360]   So this chick I was dating, she wanted to run a scam.
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:45.800]   So I set up a scam, it's semi-complicated,
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:50.640]   but the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person,
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.600]   we steal a real person's identity.
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.460]   I have a real person's identity,
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:57.120]   we get a driver's license in her name,
[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.080]   open up some bank accounts,
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.700]   go rent a piece of property in her name.
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:07.080]   And I transfer the deed from the property
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.540]   out of the real owner's name,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:13.220]   I transfer it into her stolen identity.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:19.140]   We then refinance the house like three or four times.
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.740]   And so she starts going to these different closings.
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:24.200]   Her name is Allison, and she's pretending
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:29.060]   to be a Puerto Rican woman named Rosita Perez.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:35.560]   Allison has brown hair and blue eyes,
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.880]   Rosita Perez clearly doesn't.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.920]   So Allison, when we make the ID,
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:45.760]   she dyes her hair black, curls it a little bit,
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.520]   and gets the pictures taken of herself.
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:53.080]   But before she goes to the first closing,
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:56.600]   to get a check for like $100,000,
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   we've got like three of these scheduled,
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:06.040]   she changes her hair color,
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:10.440]   she dyes it back like a dirty blonde,
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.080]   and she goes to the first closing and she gets a check,
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:14.320]   a check for $100,000, let's say.
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.860]   I don't know, it was like 95 or 105, whatever,
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:18.280]   roughly $100,000.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.920]   She gets a check at the closing, they give it to her.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.660]   We then go to the next closing.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.000]   Well, at the next closing,
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.280]   the title person has her sign all the documents,
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.960]   but she's looking at her like, something's not right.
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:36.520]   Looks at her ID, makes a copy of the ID,
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:39.120]   looks at it and says, "This doesn't look like you."
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.320]   And she's like, "You know, you don't look Hispanic."
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.880]   And she's like, "Oh, I'm half Hispanic, what do you?"
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.480]   And she's like, "You don't,"
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.480]   but keep in mind, the photograph was her.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.960]   So she's saying, "This doesn't look like you,"
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:54.440]   but it's her.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.080]   Granted, she had the curly hair a little bit,
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.840]   but that's it.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.720]   So Allison is like, "It's me."
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.320]   And she's like, "Look, I'm not gonna cut you,
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:03.840]   "I'm not gonna give you the check."
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.280]   - Yeah.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.380]   - "I mean, let's just sign the documents.
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:09.000]   "We can get the check.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.440]   "I'll let you know."
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.800]   So she goes, gets in my car.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:12.980]   She said, "Yeah, listen, there's a problem.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:13.880]   "So we're driving down the road."
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.160]   She explains it to me.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.240]   I realized, "Okay, that's done, it's over.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.160]   "We're not going back."
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.120]   She's like, "What about the other closing?"
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.360]   "No, no, no more closings, we're done."
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:26.960]   And it was probably more of a screaming and yelling,
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.080]   like, "What the hell did you do?
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.800]   "Why told you not to change your hair?
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:31.200]   "Why would you change your hair?"
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.160]   Like that, when she came in like the day before
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.380]   and I was like, "What did you do?
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.760]   "What did you do?"
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:36.600]   And she's like, "I changed my hair.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.420]   "What's the big deal?
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:38.260]   "It's still me."
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:39.520]   "Sure enough."
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.640]   You know, and that's, like,
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.440]   it's not that I knew that that was gonna happen,
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.280]   but why tempt fate?
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:48.200]   - How'd you meet Allison?
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.480]   Like, what was-- - She was a mortgage broker.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.320]   - Oh, okay.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:52.840]   - And I had done some fraudulent.
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.840]   She worked for another mortgage company.
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.880]   Sorry, she worked for another mortgage company.
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.600]   She couldn't get a loan closed.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.920]   The owner of that mortgage company called me
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.080]   and said, "Look, we got a loan.
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.920]   "We need it closed."
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:04.760]   And I said, "Great."
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.180]   And when guys would call me, I'd say,
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:07.620]   "Great, I'll come pick it up.
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:10.940]   "I'll give you a $300 or a $500 referral fee."
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:13.820]   "No, no, it's a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.720]   "We wanna close it."
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:15.560]   "Well, if you--"
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.000]   "Then close it."
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:17.940]   "Well, I can't close it.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:20.840]   "We need a W-2 or we need this, we need that.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.680]   "We can't figure out how to do it."
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.880]   So I go over there and typically I convince them,
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:25.720]   "Just give it to me.
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:26.560]   "It's not gonna close."
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.760]   She was, you'd have to see this chick.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:31.840]   She was gorgeous.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.800]   She was gorgeous, very flirtatious,
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.920]   made me feel like I was saying and handsome.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.820]   So like she gets whatever she wants.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.500]   So I'm like, "Okay, look, here's what you do."
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.400]   And I explained to her, "Do this, do this, do this.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.160]   "Send it here, it'll close."
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.120]   And she, "We closed it."
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.360]   Well, then she starts calling me, right?
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.600]   "Hey, how's it going?
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.600]   "We go to lunch, next thing you know,
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:55.040]   "we start sleeping together."
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:56.780]   She realizes what's happening.
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:58.900]   She says, "I want in on this."
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:02.120]   So now we do the closings.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.920]   We're on our way.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.880]   I say, "Look, that check's dead."
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.920]   She goes, "What about the other one?"
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:09.920]   I go, "No, no, it's all dead.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.520]   "We're walking away."
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.200]   Now, that was easy for me to say
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:18.320]   because for me, I had money.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.380]   She's going through a divorce, she's broke.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.880]   You know, like none of this did I take into consideration
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.320]   at the time, by the way.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.240]   To me, it's like, "Nah, that's dead, we're done.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.640]   "We'll start over again."
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.680]   To her, in her mind, she was about to make,
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:34.840]   we were getting probably, that was a million-dollar scam.
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:37.480]   She was about to end up getting whatever it was,
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:39.960]   half or one-third of half a million dollars
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.060]   in the next week.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:42.760]   Now she's got nothing.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:47.760]   So she says, "Look, let's at least cash this one."
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.720]   And I had a buddy named Travis Hayes
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.880]   who had been, you know, we actually were,
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.360]   we've been friends since high school.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.800]   We were like best friends, right?
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.920]   Really close friends in high school.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.800]   We were still close.
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:05.620]   Travis was running a scam.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:09.480]   This one, hers was in Clearwater, his was in Orlando.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.560]   So I'm getting all over the state at this point, right?
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.400]   So he's running an Orlando scam
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:18.820]   that's already yielded half a million, maybe more.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:21.080]   He's still pulling, we're still refinancing properties,
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   right, so he's about to close on another half a million
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.480]   dollars worth of properties.
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:26.100]   He's got a bank account that's open.
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:27.280]   She says, "Let's give it to Travis,
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.240]   "have him deposit it in his account."
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:32.600]   He's already pulled out like 300,000 out of the account.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:33.760]   And she's like, "Shouldn't be a problem."
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:36.080]   I was like, "No, no, no."
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.200]   And she goes, "Let me call him."
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:40.240]   She calls him, I think I called him
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:41.720]   and I explained the situation.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:42.560]   He's, "Do you think it's okay?"
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.680]   And I said, "No, I don't think it's okay.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.080]   "I don't think it's okay at all."
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:48.020]   And he's like, "No, it's not a big deal.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:49.360]   "Just give me the check."
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.160]   So I give him the check.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.460]   He goes, he deposits the check.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:55.380]   They say they're gonna hold it 'til it clears.
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:58.100]   You know, that was kind of a thing back then.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.540]   It takes, I don't know.
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:05.900]   I don't know how long it took, five days, six days,
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.600]   whatever it was, he was supposed to go back
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:08.440]   and it would have cleared
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.800]   and he would have been able to start pulling money out.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:13.400]   And so I call him one day 'cause Allison's bugging me.
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.200]   So I call him and I go, "Hey, where are you at?"
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.800]   He goes, "I'm actually on my way to Orlando."
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:18.640]   And I said, "Oh, okay."
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:21.400]   He said, "But let Allison know I'm not getting any money."
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.920]   He said, "The bank manager called and said
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:27.560]   "that because the check was over $100,000,
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:31.920]   "they have to witness me endorsing the back of the check."
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:34.840]   Or they had to see my something, right?
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.160]   And for me to come in, I went, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.880]   I said, "Something's wrong, something's wrong.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.740]   "Don't go to the bank.
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:40.580]   "What do you think's wrong?
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:41.660]   "I think the cops are waiting for you.
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:42.880]   "That's what I think's wrong."
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:43.760]   And he goes, "No, the cops aren't."
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.160]   He goes, "Man, I'm in the parking lot right now.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:46.000]   "I just pulled into the parking lot.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:46.840]   "There's no cops."
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:48.820]   I'm like, "They're not gonna be in squad cars."
[02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:49.660]   And he's like, "No."
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.960]   He said, "It's fine, you're overreacting, bro."
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.760]   And I'll never forget what he said.
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.640]   He said, "You're shaking like a little girl, bro.
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:58.060]   "Calm down, I got this.
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:06:59.800]   "I'm cool with the manager."
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:02.320]   Like the manager, because you've chopped it up
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:03.540]   with the manager, he's gonna let
[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:06.040]   your fraudulent check go through.
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:09.760]   So he walks in, the cops are in there.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:10.640]   They locked the door.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:13.680]   This he told me later, they closed the door, locked it.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:15.780]   The cops are in there, they grab him,
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:19.480]   and they bring him downtown.
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.880]   He didn't say anything.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.980]   He won't say anything.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.720]   That's not true, by the way.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:26.720]   But so here's what he told me, he wouldn't say anything.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:29.080]   I told him, "I'm not talking to you coppers."
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:31.600]   - Oh, he told you, but he actually did talk to him.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.440]   - He actually did talk to him.
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.440]   So what ends up happening is we can't get in touch with him.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.520]   So we're calling and calling and calling,
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.200]   and then finally I decide, you know what?
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.000]   I'm not gonna call his cell phone anymore.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.720]   I'm gonna call the name of the person he was
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.520]   that the synthetic identities number, right?
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.500]   So I go and I call the synthetic identities number.
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:59.760]   I call and I say, somebody answers and I go,
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.480]   "Hey, is so-and-so there?"
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:06.160]   And he said, and it's a gruff, authoritarian voice,
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:08.080]   you know, this is law enforcement.
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.840]   And he's like, "No, who's this?"
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:12.160]   He goes, "No, this is officer so-and-so, who's this?"
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:14.960]   And I go, I was like, "Oh, this is Lee Black."
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:17.000]   I said, he said, he goes, "How do you know so-and-so?"
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:17.840]   I was like, "Oh, no, no."
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:18.720]   Click, and I just hung up.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.840]   And I called for like a pay phone.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.200]   So I turned around, I said, he got arrested.
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:24.200]   And then later on that night,
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:27.400]   he showed up on the county website,
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:30.360]   you know, the arrest website showing he had been arrested.
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.720]   And the next day he calls me
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.000]   and he asked me to get him out of jail.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.360]   Like, "Hey, you gotta go."
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.860]   So I have to give his brother-in-law money.
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:43.880]   You know, we get him out of jail.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:45.040]   He actually got out-- - For bailing?
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.440]   - Yeah, he got out for like nothing.
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:48.240]   And here's where I should have known
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.760]   that he was cooperating.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:54.080]   It went from like $300,000 bond down to like $10,000.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:54.960]   So it's a thousand bucks.
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.320]   So right then, I didn't know it at the time,
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:59.760]   but obviously that means we're gonna let him out of jail.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.200]   He's cooperating.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.440]   So they let him out of jail.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.120]   I go and I get him a lawyer, a state.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:07.520]   This was state, by the way.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.460]   It wasn't federal.
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:12.600]   So I get him a lawyer for like $15,000.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:15.200]   He comes, you know, he comes there.
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:16.040]   Of course, he tells me, look,
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:17.040]   they asked me a bunch of questions.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:21.880]   I told him that he made up some story
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:23.760]   about he's working with another guy,
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.960]   but he doesn't know the guy's name.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.800]   He made up a name.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.520]   He has this whole kind of thing
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.040]   where he tells them about me, but not me.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:34.200]   And he's like, you know, none of the numbers led anywhere.
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.100]   So they all lead to cell phones
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:38.320]   that are only being used for those scams.
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.520]   So it's a dead alley or blind alley.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.240]   And I'm like, okay, okay.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.840]   And I mean, I'm paying him, like he's coming in.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.760]   Man, my truck's no good.
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.600]   I need another truck.
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.440]   I buy him another truck.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.240]   Hey, man, the electric's gonna get turned off.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:55.840]   And I don't have, oh, I need $1,000.
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.000]   Of course, here's $1,000.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.960]   I don't know what I was, I'm embarrassed you had to ask.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:09:59.920]   Here's 1,000.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.440]   You know, and a week later, you know,
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.040]   he needs 2,000 for this, 1,000 for this, 2,000 for this.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:05.840]   He wants to start a tree trimming company.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.240]   He needs to buy a tree trimmer.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.080]   How much are those?
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.760]   5,000, of course.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:11.400]   10, so I give him another 25,000.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.040]   Starts like a tree trimming business,
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.340]   which he runs to this day.
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.900]   Um, what I don't know is that, you know,
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:23.740]   the whole time he's actually working with a task force
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.100]   that's been put together.
[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:26.260]   - Federal or?
[02:10:26.260 --> 02:10:27.460]   - This is state at this point.
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:29.380]   It's a state task force,
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:31.420]   'cause there's multiple counties involved at this point.
[02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:33.500]   And it wasn't hard for him to explain.
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:36.060]   Like, this is, this comes back to reservoir dogs.
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:38.300]   I got a much, all he had to say to the officers was,
[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:40.100]   listen, you gotta let me go.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:41.380]   I can't do any prison time.
[02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:43.860]   I'm gonna tell you about a much, much bigger scam.
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:46.060]   And they go, okay, well, how can you prove that scam?
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.380]   Pull up Hillsborough County,
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:50.740]   Hillsborough County's tax appraiser website.
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:52.940]   Okay, look up the name James Red.
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:56.620]   Look, all of these were bought six months ago.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:59.380]   Six months later, they're all in foreclosure.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:00.740]   Pull up Lee Black.
[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:02.020]   All of these were bought.
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.700]   Look, six months later, all of them are foreclosure.
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:09.540]   Hey, pull up James, pull up Brandon Green, pull up.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:11.540]   So all of these are going in foreclosure.
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:13.380]   I mean, it's so, it's like, you know,
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:16.460]   that what I thought was so cute, not cute.
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:18.060]   It was just stupid.
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:20.460]   And so he very quickly, they put together a task force.
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:23.540]   He's working with them on the task force.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:28.540]   And we're still buying houses,
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.860]   flipping houses, doing everything.
[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:30.980]   'Cause I'm, I believe him.
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:33.780]   I believe he's not, you know, he's saying,
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.940]   look, if I have to go to jail for, you know, a year or so,
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:37.940]   like, you know, and he's also paying, you know,
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:39.820]   he hasn't paid them back yet, but he,
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:42.100]   but we're saying he can pay them back.
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:44.220]   Like, it's like, look, if we get to the point, you know,
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:47.320]   when we get to that point, like we'll pay them back.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.680]   But we haven't paid them back yet.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.580]   'Cause we have no way to show where that money came from.
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.180]   We can always go to like one of his relatives
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:57.540]   and give his dad 40 grand, give his mom 20 grand,
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:58.980]   you know, that kind of stuff and start putting money
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:11:59.820]   that way.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:01.420]   And all that money was taken out in cash too.
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:03.780]   So we could always show up with a chunk in cash.
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:06.800]   Regardless, you know, it's still in the process.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.100]   And I think that we're still in the process
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:09.740]   and it could be six months or a year away
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:10.560]   'cause it's a slow thing.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.980]   I've already been through the process my first time
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:14.540]   when I got in trouble and it was a year,
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:17.260]   but from the time that I was spoken to
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.700]   until I pled guilty and was sentenced.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:23.980]   So I'm not concerned about it.
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:26.060]   Well, that's happening.
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.420]   We're still flipping properties.
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:32.420]   And one day I have a buddy named Steve Sutton,
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:35.260]   remember the sheriff's deputy.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:38.060]   And keep in mind, it's funny because like I've done bad loans
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:43.060]   for police officers, sheriffs, lawyers, doctors,
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.160]   like, you know, across everybody.
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.440]   These aren't like all, you know.
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.600]   - Yeah, everybody.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:51.000]   - Guys that, you know, these aren't all like, you know,
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.360]   construction workers or guys that work in mechanics
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.200]   or something.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.800]   These are like legitimate people that have credit problems
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:58.480]   or whatever the case may be.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.980]   So one day I'm sitting at work
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:07.040]   and I'd been getting phone calls for the prior week
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:10.280]   from people at title companies saying,
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.600]   "Hey, Matt, wanted to let you know,
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:16.760]   we just had some subpoenas served on several of your files."
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:21.040]   And I'm concerned, like that had me concerned.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.040]   Then a guy named Jeff Testerman starts making phone calls.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:30.080]   Jeff Testerman is a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.080]   He's calling people saying,
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.160]   "Hey, I noticed that you sold a piece of property
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:38.380]   to Lee Black.
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.560]   Have you ever met Mr. Black?"
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.880]   He seems like, and they're like just hanging up on him
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.200]   or saying, "No, I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.880]   I'm not sure what that guy's name was.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:46.240]   Let me call you back."
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:47.520]   And I'm getting phone calls from people.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.200]   So I know something's up with the newspaper.
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.260]   Now I know something's being looked at,
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:53.000]   but nobody's really talking.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.760]   I know that there are subpoenas being served
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:01.640]   and I'm nervous, you know, I'm very concerned.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.820]   And then one day I'm in my office
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:07.680]   and the sheriff's deputy walks in, Steve Sutton,
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.000]   in his uniform too, which everybody always stiffened,
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.080]   you know, when he would walk in.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.120]   So he walks in, I go, "Steve," I said, "What's going on?"
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.000]   He's head, and usually he's jolly and laughs and stuff.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.720]   And he goes, and he says, "I gotta talk to you outside."
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:19.880]   I was like, "Okay."
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:21.800]   I walk outside, "What's up?"
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:24.680]   And he says, "I used to date this girl
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.480]   in the Tampa Police Department or something, right?"
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:28.720]   I was like, "Okay."
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:30.880]   He said, "She showed up at my house this morning
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.920]   at like six o'clock in the morning."
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:34.960]   I went, "Okay."
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.160]   He said, "She said that she's been working on a task force."
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:41.760]   And he said, "Apparently one of your buddies
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.400]   got arrested in Orlando.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.560]   They're investigating some other thing in Clearwater.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:49.760]   They're investigating a ton of properties here
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.600]   in Ybor, Tampa Heights.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:56.880]   And I mean, there's like a hundred properties involved.
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:02.120]   And my name came up because you've sold some properties
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.480]   to me," which I had.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.240]   And he's like, "So she came to me and said,
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.120]   'Look, your buddy Cox.'"
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:09.800]   He said, and I was like, "Okay."
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.720]   He goes, he said, "Well, the task force is on you."
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.520]   And she said to stop talking to you
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:17.440]   because they're gonna come arrest you in a couple days.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.400]   They just handed over the task force findings to the FBI,
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:25.800]   and the FBI is going to come arrest you in a couple days.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.400]   And she said not to talk to you.
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:31.240]   Because you're going to cooperate,
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:34.880]   and because all white collar guys cooperate.
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:39.520]   So she thinks you're gonna cooperate and not to talk to you
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.960]   'cause she's afraid you're gonna get me hemmed up.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.280]   And she said just to walk away.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.000]   And he was like, "So I thought you should know."
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.760]   And I was like, "Okay."
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.880]   And he said, "What are you gonna do?"
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.200]   I said, "Oh, I'm, you know, I don't know."
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.760]   Well, first he said, "What should I do?"
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.880]   And I go, "Tell 'em, tell 'em that I arranged
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.760]   all the loans for you.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.520]   You came in, you signed the paperwork.
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:01.680]   I filled out all the documents.
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.800]   You signed the paperwork.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.560]   You, you know, I arranged everything."
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.720]   I'm like, "You're not a mortgage broker.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.680]   You don't know if this is legit.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.600]   Like, you signed, you have perfect credit.
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.640]   You signed the paperwork.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:12.360]   You walked away with a check for 30,000.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:13.600]   You don't know."
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.600]   And he was like, 'cause he did it 'cause he had a job.
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:16.480]   He was a sheriff's deputy.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:17.760]   Like, I'm not a, you know.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:21.840]   I went in, I applied for a loan at a bank.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.600]   They said, "You can buy the house
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.040]   and we'll give you $30,000."
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.960]   So of course I'm gonna do that, you know.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:29.840]   That's not gonna happen, but he doesn't know.
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.520]   He's, and I said, "Just tell 'em, yeah.
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.560]   Tell 'em you'll cooperate."
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:33.640]   Like, absolutely.
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.400]   He's, "What are you gonna do?"
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:37.220]   I said, "Me?"
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:38.320]   I said, "I'm leaving, bro.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.160]   I'm leaving."
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:41.120]   I said, "I can't, I can't stay here.
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.560]   I can't go to prison.
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:43.480]   Like, I was just sentenced.
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:44.840]   I'm on federal probation right now.
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:45.960]   Like, the judge isn't gonna be cool
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.800]   with me getting popped again.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.040]   Like, I mean, he, I can't do it.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:51.880]   Can't do it."
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:53.080]   I said, "I'm leaving.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:53.920]   Can't go to prison.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:55.340]   I'm adorable, bro.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.520]   Like, you know, I can't.
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:57.760]   I saw Shawshank Redemption.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:58.920]   I know what's gonna happen.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:16:59.740]   I can't."
[02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:00.580]   - You're too good looking.
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:01.420]   - "Yeah, I can't do that.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:02.400]   That's not gonna happen.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:03.680]   Like, I can't, you know, I can't,
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:06.120]   I'm not gonna defend myself against a guy
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.220]   who's six foot three and tatted up.
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.400]   No.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.000]   So, and you know, and I can't, I'm not gonna,
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.680]   I'm no benefit to a gang.
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.120]   Like, I'm not, I'm a nonviolent, you know,
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:18.240]   soft white collar criminal."
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.840]   So I was just like, I was like, "Yeah, I'm leaving, bro.
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.000]   I'm leaving."
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.000]   So I actually went home, well, actually I was able to,
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.240]   I started cutting checks to people, right?
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.360]   So I cut checks to Allison, to Johnny,
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.400]   to like everybody I could think of.
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.240]   Here's 5,000.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.060]   Here's 7,000.
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:35.900]   Here's 8,000.
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:36.720]   Here's six.
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:37.560]   Here's nine.
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:38.760]   And had them go into all these different bank accounts,
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:39.840]   pulling out cash.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:42.120]   But this is like a Thursday at four o'clock.
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.240]   So the next day they show up with cash,
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:45.120]   write some more checks.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:46.480]   They go again.
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.800]   I get about 80 grand in cash.
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:48.880]   That's all I can get.
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:55.120]   I go home that night, I start packing my bags,
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:58.720]   and I was dating this chick named Rebecca Houck.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:00.560]   We'd been dating about a month.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.240]   And she shows up at my house.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:06.200]   You know, I hadn't returned her phone calls all day,
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:07.240]   and apparently we were supposed to go out,
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:08.080]   and I'd forgotten about it.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:09.280]   I had bigger issues.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.600]   And so I'm packing a couple of duffel bags,
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.400]   and she walks in and she's like, "What's going on?"
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.320]   I'm like, "I'm leaving."
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:18.160]   "Where are you going?
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.120]   I thought we were supposed to go out at such
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.240]   and go do something tonight."
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:22.800]   I'm like, "I'm leaving, it's over."
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:24.240]   And she says, "What happened?"
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.080]   I tell her what happened.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:25.920]   This is what happened.
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:28.040]   She's like, "Oh my God."
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:29.440]   Like she had no idea.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.080]   - Well, she had no idea about anything you were doing.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:32.760]   - No, I barely knew her.
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:34.240]   Like, I mean, she's coming over two,
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.920]   three times a week for a month.
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:38.840]   Like I've, you know, this isn't love.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:42.440]   This isn't, you know, this is a booty call.
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:43.280]   That's all it is.
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:45.320]   Like we're hanging out, we're having sex, and that's it.
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:46.400]   I don't even know you.
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:51.400]   So she suddenly just begs to come with me.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:54.240]   "You gotta bring me with you.
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.320]   You have to do this, you have to do that."
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.160]   I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.640]   Like, "You've got a son.
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.440]   You have, your mom lives here.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:06.040]   And she's just in tears and crying."
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:08.360]   And she suddenly said, and this is what's so funny about it.
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.360]   She had just moved from Vegas to St. Petersburg
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.440]   to work at the dog track,
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:19.680]   to work for a company that owned the dog track, right?
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:24.240]   A casino interest, or yeah, like a gambling company.
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:28.120]   And she said, "You don't even know why I'm here."
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.840]   I was like, "Okay, why are you here?"
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.480]   She said, "I'm here because I was working for a law firm
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:38.680]   that worked for the casino company that I worked for."
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:43.000]   She said, "I got caught embezzling nothing.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.500]   It was like 10 or $15,000 from my boss."
[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:48.640]   'Cause she had a gambling habit.
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:52.060]   And she said, "He didn't call the police
[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:53.240]   because we were sleeping together
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.400]   and he was afraid his wife would find out."
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.400]   She said, "So instead, he banished me here to St. Pete.
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:03.520]   My son just came to live with me.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:06.000]   He's been caught sneaking out."
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.160]   'Cause the father had raised him.
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.520]   He'd only been living with her since she got to Florida.
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.620]   And she's like, "I was gonna send him back.
[02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:13.480]   He's failing school.
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:14.320]   He's smoking pot.
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.320]   He's been caught sneaking out after curfew."
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.560]   I'm like, "Okay, I don't know any of this."
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:20.600]   She's like, "He was going back in December."
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:22.740]   No, he was going back after the school year,
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:24.680]   which would have been like May.
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:25.520]   "Okay."
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:30.240]   And I'm like, "So where before, five minutes earlier,
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:34.160]   I thought she was this sweet secretary,
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.980]   sweet, innocent secretary."
[02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:40.600]   And she's like, "I've been married three times.
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:42.360]   I am a gambler.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:44.400]   I've blamed bankruptcy.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.560]   I'm sleeping with my old boss."
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:50.680]   I got like, she went from this thieving adulteress,
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:56.360]   and I thought, "These are all really beneficial
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:59.680]   to my future plans."
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.840]   And I shouldn't have, at that moment,
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:06.120]   I was so just flipped out and concerned.
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:09.000]   And up and leaving your life
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.340]   and everything you know behind,
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.600]   that's terrifying.
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.960]   And so now you're alone in a strange place.
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:19.000]   - Is that the first time you've done something like that,
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000]   like leave to go on the road?
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.040]   - Yes.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.600]   So I never just up and moved.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:25.500]   And keep in mind now I can't call home.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.080]   I can't, like I'm leaving.
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.640]   There are things that I feel like get you caught.
[02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:31.760]   And I've watched tons of these TV shows.
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:34.280]   And there are certain things that get you caught.
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:35.920]   And one of them is keeping in contact
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.080]   with anybody in your old life.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.600]   So I'm thinking that's not gonna happen.
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:42.960]   Like I'm not contacting anybody.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.920]   I'm leaving and that's it.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:44.740]   That didn't really happen.
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:45.580]   I kept in touch.
[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:46.440]   I called my mom every once in a while.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:51.440]   But I was like, "Okay, that's cool."
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:55.520]   - Did the loneliness of that hit you early on or no?
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.880]   Like as you're packing?
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:57.720]   - I never did.
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:21:58.560]   Well.
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:00.880]   - You're leaving your life.
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:04.920]   I mean, there's a, it feels like a fundamental transition.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:05.760]   - Oh, listen.
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.720]   - You think?
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.480]   - I mean, it was not just that.
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:11.720]   Like I'm leaving my son.
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:13.400]   I have a son.
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.960]   And I was leaving everything.
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:19.000]   I was just terrified of going to prison.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:23.160]   And I mean, I don't know, it was just so stupid.
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:24.000]   It was just arrogance.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.960]   And I should have stayed.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:28.040]   Like I made things so much worse.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.460]   But I also thought, I'm smart.
[02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:34.480]   I can figure this out.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:37.480]   Like I can change my identity, blend in, I'll be fine.
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:39.200]   - Aren't you already, like people know
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:40.480]   what your face looks like?
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:41.440]   - They do, they do.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:44.360]   But one of the first things I did was I got plastic surgery.
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.640]   - What kind of plastic surgery?
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.560]   - I've got a nose job.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.760]   I got what they call a mini facelift.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:52.200]   They go in through the back of your ears
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.360]   and they suck out all the fat in your neck.
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:56.120]   - Does that change your appearance much?
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:57.880]   - Yeah, a little bit.
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:59.560]   I got, I was balding.
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:02.520]   I got two hair transplants, you know, two hair grafts.
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.600]   So the hair in my head, this isn't my hair.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.640]   It's my hair, but it's from back here.
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:08.120]   So there's, they cut it from here.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:08.960]   - Oh, this is great.
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.640]   - I appreciate it.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.000]   So they re-implanted it there, you know,
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.440]   got liposuction, just some, you know, other stuff.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.280]   And, you know, got my teeth done, that sort of thing.
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:21.360]   You know, so, you know, and I,
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:22.760]   that was kind of like my plan.
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.720]   I'll go, I'll take off.
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.560]   I got 80 grand.
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:26.720]   I'll steal some more money, you know.
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:31.240]   But I let her come with me and we ran up all my credit cards
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.800]   over the next few days, packed up the car,
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:37.480]   traded in my Audi and got like an Audi.
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:39.400]   I don't know, was it like an A6 or like a Ford
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:42.040]   or like the big Ford or whatever it was.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:46.720]   Got that and drove straight to Atlanta.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:53.200]   And so I wrote a letter to my parents before I left,
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:56.480]   just explaining this is what's happening.
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:58.120]   I'm leaving, I'm done.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.320]   I'm not going to prison.
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:02.160]   Love you.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.120]   Sorry.
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:03.960]   - Sorry.
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:04.800]   - Sorry.
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.320]   Sorry, I'm, I know I'm a disappointment.
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:07.400]   Sorry.
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:08.720]   Bam.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:12.920]   So I take off, go to Atlanta.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:18.680]   When we went to Atlanta, I already had the name
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:23.680]   of a guy named Scott Kugnow that I'd done a loan for.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:30.240]   So I had his, you know, his vital information, right?
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.120]   Like I have his name, date of birth, social security number,
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.320]   mother's maiden name and where he was born.
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.560]   One day we were having a conversation
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:42.480]   and I just slowly pried all that out of him, right?
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.920]   Like I already, we'd done a loan for him.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.200]   So I had his name, date of birth, social security number,
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:49.520]   but I need to steal his identity.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.000]   I need to know where he was born and his mother's maiden name.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.920]   So through the course of a conversation, I just pried,
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:58.600]   you know, hey, you know, Kugnow, is that, you know,
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:24:59.420]   what is that?
[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:00.260]   Is that like Irish?
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:01.080]   Is it, no, it's such and such.
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:02.120]   What's your mom's name?
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:02.960]   Oh, such and such.
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.200]   Oh, okay.
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:05.040]   - Yeah.
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:06.640]   - You know, oh, were you born here?
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.280]   You born in, weren't you from, oh man, I was born here.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.000]   I was born in such, oh, it all broke out on me.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.600]   You know, like I, so it was no big deal.
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:16.240]   We get to Atlanta.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.400]   I make a fake ID for both of us, but keep in mind,
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:21.600]   I don't have, like I don't have a driver's license.
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.480]   I do, but they're fake.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:25.800]   Like I can't give this to a cop.
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.520]   Can't give a driver's license that says David Freeman.
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:31.240]   - What's David's residence, Florida, or is this Georgia?
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.120]   - No, this is Florida, but it was just a made-up name.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.900]   I'd gone to like high school with a kid named David Freeman.
[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:41.260]   So I had an ID, but I can't give that to a cop.
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:43.080]   Like that's enough to get like rent a place
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:44.320]   or do something.
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.320]   So we go, go to Atlanta, make an ID, set it up,
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.200]   make some business cards, set up a couple of websites,
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:58.880]   set up some, get an HQ, which is that like a,
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:01.000]   it's a company that will, you can do virtual,
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.880]   you can rent offices and they'll answer your phone
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:06.160]   for like a hundred bucks a month and they'll forward them.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:08.040]   So it seems like you have an office.
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.360]   They'll, you know, they give you a phone number
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.000]   that you call up and they say, you know,
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.920]   hi, United Southern Bank, you know,
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:15.000]   and they'll answer the phone and forward messages.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.960]   So we get one of those, make a business card for Becky.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.800]   She rents a house from a guy named Michael Shanahan.
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:26.480]   So we rent Michael Shanahan's house.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:29.900]   It's like $200,000, $200,000 house in Alpharetta.
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:35.200]   And I then go to Alabama, wait,
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.360]   I then order Scott Cugno's birth certificate,
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:41.000]   social security card.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.360]   I think I registered a vote in his name
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:49.600]   and I made a lease agreement in his name.
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.040]   And I think that's all I needed.
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.600]   And then I went to Alabama
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:57.720]   and got a driver's license in his name.
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:00.640]   So I went into DMV, give him all these documents
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:04.000]   and which are almost all of them are real,
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.320]   except for the lease.
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.360]   They said, sit over there.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.760]   I sit over there, I sit down, boom.
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.320]   20 minutes later, I have a driver's license.
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:11.760]   It's, you know, it was 20 something dollars.
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:12.600]   It was nothing.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.560]   So I get the driver's license.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.040]   Now I'm driving this, I'm still driving a car
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:18.560]   that an Audi that is in the name of Matt Cox.
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.200]   So I parked that.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:23.960]   I then go get social security
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.900]   to issue me a social security number
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.920]   in the name Scott Cugno.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:30.000]   And I then turn around and I go and I get a loan.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.840]   You put down 20, 30%.
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:34.480]   There's all these first time or first time buyers.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.480]   30% down, get like a Honda or something.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.760]   So now we're living in a house.
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.200]   We've got some furniture, bedroom furniture.
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:45.360]   And I go downtown, I pull the title to this guy,
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.040]   Michael Shanahan's house.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:54.480]   And I go downtown and I satisfy the loan on his house.
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:59.020]   So he had two loans with Bank of America.
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:03.360]   And so I create two satisfaction of loans
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.960]   from Bank of America.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.440]   So Michael Shanahan owns a house
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:09.520]   in the name Michael Shanahan.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.420]   He has one mortgage with Bank of America and a second one.
[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:15.760]   When you pay your mortgage off,
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.520]   the way public records knows it's paid off
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:23.520]   is they mail public records a satisfaction of mortgage.
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:25.900]   It's a one page document and it's notarized.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.440]   - So you've got two of those.
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.640]   - I filled out two, I created two of them.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:33.640]   I just ordered, you can do research.
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.680]   So when I went downtown,
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.960]   I researched Bank of America satisfaction of mortgages
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:41.660]   and thousands show up.
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:42.960]   So I just grab a couple of them
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.880]   and now I know what the basic template is.
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:46.240]   And they're all different by the way.
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.540]   So it's not like you even have to be that close,
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:52.200]   but whatever, I mimicked some of them.
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.360]   I had a notary stamp, not hard to get.
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:00.360]   You go in and you go into three different office depots
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:04.540]   and you say, "Hey, I need a notary stamp."
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:06.040]   And you give them the information
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:07.680]   and you come back four day or whatever,
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:09.640]   a week later and they give it to you.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:12.080]   So I've got these notary stamps.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.840]   So I notarize the satisfactions.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.440]   I go downtown, I file them, boom, the mortgages are gone.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:18.600]   Keep in mind Bank of America,
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:19.880]   he's still paying the mortgages.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:21.480]   They don't know that they've been satisfied
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:23.720]   in public records, they're not notified.
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:26.320]   So those are gone, but it takes about a month or two
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:27.160]   for it to show up.
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:29.640]   Atlanta was that far behind.
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:31.960]   I think it was Fulton County, they were just way behind.
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:35.020]   So we just kind of have to dick around for a while, right?
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:36.980]   So we're going on little vacations.
[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:38.540]   We're going to New Orleans.
[02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:41.300]   We're going to different places.
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:46.100]   As Scott Kugno, driving a car, Scott Kugno.
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:47.460]   We open up several bank accounts.
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:49.260]   We have multiple bank accounts.
[02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:52.620]   And then we end up going to Vegas.
[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:54.660]   And we do go to Vegas,
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:55.980]   but what happened was we were driving around
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:58.100]   and I remember thinking, telling her,
[02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:00.460]   I was like, "You know, this is a problem.
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:04.800]   We have to get real IDs, real driver's licenses.
[02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.940]   I mean, this is real, but this is a real person too.
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:08.480]   And he may stumble across it."
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:13.240]   And so what I did was I started running ads in magazines
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:18.120]   saying home loans available, good credit, bad credit,
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.600]   no problem, call now, government loans,
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:25.520]   government, VA, FHA, fine, call this number.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:29.160]   So people start calling and I'm getting their information.
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:32.660]   And one of the guys I got was Michael Eckert.
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:36.000]   Yeah, I remember, Michael Eckert, poor Michael Eckert.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.460]   I actually legally changed his name
[02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:41.060]   to Michael Johnson at one point,
[02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:43.420]   but at this point it was just Michael Eckert.
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:48.420]   So I don't, I wanted to see, you know, I'm bored.
[02:30:48.420 --> 02:30:49.740]   I want to see what the process is.
[02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:51.020]   How much does it cost?
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:52.020]   Is this possible?
[02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:53.940]   Let me see if I can change this guy's name.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:56.260]   It was 1,500 bucks, I changed it.
[02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:57.940]   Without him ever showing up anywhere.
[02:30:57.940 --> 02:30:59.200]   So you can--
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:00.760]   - Well, I have a driver's license in his name.
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:02.100]   - Right. - I am him.
[02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:02.940]   So he did show up.
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:06.400]   He showed up at the lawyer's office, he, so, you know.
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:07.240]   - Right.
[02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:10.080]   - So I'm, so I do that.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:15.080]   I'm living in the house and we're driving along one day
[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:18.800]   and I'm saying, "Man, we gotta get real."
[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:20.400]   Like these people that are calling,
[02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:23.440]   like that one guy I get his information,
[02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:25.460]   but during the course of taking the application
[02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:28.480]   and I'm asking like these government survey questions
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:30.520]   at the very end, it's like 20 questions
[02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:32.360]   and I'm rambling them off.
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:35.400]   And at some point he was like, he said, he volunteered.
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:37.240]   Like I didn't know, I never even asked anybody
[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.040]   about criminal history and he just,
[02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:40.760]   he ended up saying something.
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:42.200]   "Well, I do have a felony.
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:43.040]   "Does that matter?"
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:44.840]   I mean, he's like, he was, I mean, it was a DUI.
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:47.160]   I've had a couple DUIs, but I got my license back
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.240]   and that was part of the reason he had bad credit.
[02:31:49.240 --> 02:31:53.200]   And it was like, okay, no, no, it doesn't matter.
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.080]   Don't worry, I'm thinking, you're not getting a loan.
[02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.420]   So this is, I'm just taking your,
[02:31:56.420 --> 02:31:58.480]   I'm just stealing from you, stealing your information.
[02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:01.800]   So I get all this information, I'm gathering it.
[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:04.160]   And so one of the things I said to Becky
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:06.600]   while we were sitting at this stoplight is I'm like,
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:10.440]   we gotta get real, people's real information.
[02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:11.760]   And I said like, for instance, I said,
[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:13.040]   what if I steal somebody's identity?
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:15.040]   I get a driver's license in his name,
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:18.080]   four states from where he lives and he gets a DUI.
[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:20.480]   I could get pulled over two years later
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:24.320]   and get arrested for a DUI that he got in Florida.
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.560]   And she's like, well, what are you thinking?
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:28.120]   Are you thinking like criminals
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:32.040]   or are you thinking like prisoners, like mental patients?
[02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:33.960]   Like, and I went, I mean, I don't,
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:36.160]   and I looked over and there was a homeless guy
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:40.220]   holding a sign and I went like that guy.
[02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:42.800]   And I remember she goes, she's the hobo?
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.760]   Like, I don't know who calls them hobos.
[02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:45.960]   And she's like, the hobo?
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:48.880]   I said, yes, that guy.
[02:32:48.880 --> 02:32:52.120]   I said, hold on, pulled over to a subway, got out.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.400]   She went inside to get subway.
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.800]   I walk across the street, pulled out like 20 bucks.
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:57.640]   And I said, hey bro,
[02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:58.920]   can I ask you some quick questions real quick?
[02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:00.120]   He's like, yeah, what's up?
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:01.060]   And I go, here's 20 bucks.
[02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:04.360]   I said, listen, I said,
[02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:06.280]   when was the last time you were gainfully employed?
[02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:09.440]   He's like, ah, whatever, 10 years.
[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.760]   I'm like, oh, okay.
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:12.200]   Do you have a criminal record?
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.280]   He's like, ah, I've been arrested in misdemeanors,
[02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:16.240]   like, you know, vagrancy.
[02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:17.600]   And he names off some things, you know,
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:19.000]   drunk in public, whatever.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.080]   And I was like, are you on probation?
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.320]   He goes, I can't, I can't, I can't do probation.
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:24.200]   They don't give us probation.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:25.720]   They keep us for 90 days.
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:26.960]   They release us.
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:29.080]   Like the judge knows I can't do,
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:30.960]   I'm not gonna show up for a probation.
[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.760]   I'm like, okay, do you have a driver's license?
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:35.100]   He's like, maybe, I don't think so.
[02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:37.800]   I think it's just, I go, is it DUI?
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:40.120]   He's like, no, I think it's just expired.
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:41.320]   Do you have a driver's license with you?
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.360]   He's like, no, I got nothing.
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:44.840]   I'm like, okay, well, you know.
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:47.520]   He told me he lived in like a tent in the woods.
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.260]   And so I give him like another 20 bucks,
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:53.100]   asked him a few more questions.
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:57.560]   And then, oh, and I remember in the middle of it,
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:00.720]   he said, he goes, what, are you taking a survey or something?
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:04.600]   And I remember thinking, I go, I kind of chuckled.
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:06.840]   I go, you get a lot of surveyors out here like that?
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:08.580]   And he goes, yeah, sometimes.
[02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:09.600]   And I was like, really?
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.200]   He goes, yeah, he said like the,
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:15.480]   he said people from like halfway houses
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.160]   and what do you say, social workers and stuff,
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:22.400]   they'll come out and they'll pass out stuff
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:23.740]   and they'll ask us questions and stuff.
[02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:25.180]   And I'm like, oh, okay.
[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:27.260]   And I was like, I thought, that's good to know.
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:31.440]   So I go back, I get, grab Becky and she's like,
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:32.860]   oh, she's like, did you give him money?
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.460]   I said, I gave him like 40 or 60 bucks or something.
[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:36.300]   Forget what.
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:37.500]   And she was like, that's, what a waste of money.
[02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:38.340]   I thought it was good.
[02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:40.180]   That was money well spent.
[02:34:40.180 --> 02:34:42.380]   I said, that guy's perfect.
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:47.180]   I said, that guy is, he's got everything.
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:48.780]   He has no way to be contacted.
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:51.460]   He has no documentation on him.
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:53.840]   I said, he's not gonna drive a car.
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:54.920]   He's not gonna get a DUI.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:56.320]   He has an expired license.
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:59.660]   I just have to get his license reinstated and I can be him.
[02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:03.000]   So I went home, I typed up a,
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.120]   what I called a federal statistical survey form.
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:07.040]   And I made a little thing.
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:08.120]   I mean, I went online.
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:10.240]   I mean, I'm always filling out federal documents
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:11.080]   as a mortgage broker.
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:12.240]   So it looked identical.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.800]   I mean, I had like this little, like the recycle symbol
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:18.560]   and it was like, you know, federal form 17-0-17,
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.900]   you know, and so I print out these forms.
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.020]   I go buy a clipboard.
[02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:27.860]   I make a little Salvation Army ID.
[02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:31.660]   I pin it on me and I go out and I start--
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:32.580]   - Doing surveys.
[02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:34.380]   - I start surveying homeless people.
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:35.420]   Don't judge me, bro.
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:36.900]   I was in a bad spot.
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:38.060]   I was in a bad spot.
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:40.260]   I see the judgment.
[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:41.920]   I see the judgment.
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:43.900]   Let's maintain civility here.
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:46.380]   Like stay neutral, stay neutral.
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:47.920]   - So these homeless guys, I mean,
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:50.720]   they have a social security number.
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:53.940]   They have a birth certificate, I guess.
[02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:55.200]   I mean, they're a real person.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.040]   - Right, they're perfect. - They're a real person.
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:58.000]   - They're just not using their real person.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000]   - Yeah, they're not actively engaging
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.680]   with the economic system, the financial system.
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:06.720]   They're not employed, they don't have housing,
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:07.560]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.640]   - Yeah, they don't file taxes, they don't.
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:13.520]   So one of the questions I even asked the guy,
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:15.620]   one of the last questions I said,
[02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:18.060]   "Do you believe that you will be gainfully employed
[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:20.540]   "within the next two years?"
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:23.420]   Every one of them said, "No, no, no."
[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:26.820]   So it was like, okay, they're not even trying.
[02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:28.500]   And they all had alcohol problems.
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:30.220]   Or honestly, the few of them I talked to,
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:31.820]   like it was pretty clear.
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:34.340]   I mean, it takes literally five minutes,
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:35.780]   less than five minutes to fill out the form.
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:38.200]   And I filled it out for them, of course.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.100]   But even filling it out in that brief,
[02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:42.900]   just asking questions back and forth,
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:45.220]   half of them you could tell you've got some mental illness,
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:46.620]   like something's not right with you.
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.940]   Like these aren't guys that are gonna go out
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:49.700]   and get, are going to get jobs.
[02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:50.800]   They're not cleaning up.
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.660]   So they were perfect for my purposes,
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:56.580]   as horrible as I know that sounds.
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:59.900]   - Do you feel bad about this little, small tangent?
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:01.420]   - No.
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:02.900]   Do I feel bad about it?
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:05.900]   - The homeless people in society are really,
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:09.140]   it's a difficult life, like dealing with mental illness,
[02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:11.860]   dealing with drug addiction, all that kind of stuff.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:13.860]   I mean, being in prison,
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:16.140]   and then the people that are in prison
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:19.820]   that are going to be homeless, or have been homeless,
[02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:22.020]   or the mental illness that I've dealt with
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:24.740]   in halfway houses, and even doing this.
[02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:27.540]   I don't know what you do with these people.
[02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:29.300]   I don't even know that you house them.
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:32.260]   You can't necessarily even house them together.
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:34.260]   They cause such problems.
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:37.380]   Like, I don't know what the solution is,
[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:40.600]   other than just kind of keeping them fed, maybe,
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:45.380]   and keep them away from normal people,
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:47.180]   so they don't cause crime, or whatever.
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:48.860]   I don't know about housing them in one area.
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:50.720]   That seems like a mistake.
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.660]   There is absolutely no good solution to that problem, none.
[02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:58.500]   Because it's not like, hey, if we gave you a house,
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:00.380]   and we gave you job training, and we gave you this,
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:04.100]   okay, you might get 5%, 10,
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:05.420]   but most of them are on the street
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:08.100]   because they've just messed up over, and over,
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:10.520]   and over again, and they just kinda gave up.
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.920]   - But, you know, I guess we still have to remember
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:14.120]   that they're human beings.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.920]   I mean, we mentioned off mic, Soft White Underbelly.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:20.680]   He highlights the humanity of people
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:22.720]   who've had a real difficult life.
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:23.840]   He does it well.
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.600]   - He's, Mark Leda is amazing.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:28.520]   He's amazing.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.340]   And one of the things he had said was,
[02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:33.000]   like, these are, he was like, these are real people,
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.620]   and he's like, they're stories.
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:37.200]   He's like, they have stories, and they need, you know.
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:40.580]   But if you also talk to Mark, he'll tell ya,
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:42.340]   you can't just, you can't give him money.
[02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:45.220]   You can't, like, you can't, like, he's tried,
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:48.860]   every time he's reached out and tried to help these guys,
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:51.320]   put 'em in apartments, fed them,
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:52.840]   got them back on their feet.
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:54.780]   Within six months, they're back on the street.
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:58.100]   I mean, it just happens over, and over, and over again.
[02:38:58.100 --> 02:39:00.940]   I mean, I think the amount of money
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:05.100]   that would have to be dumped into correcting that problem,
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:06.820]   I don't know.
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:09.440]   You can say, well, yeah, but just, you know,
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:11.920]   you should do it because it's the right thing to do.
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:13.880]   I don't know who's paying for it.
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:15.840]   - It's complicated, but for your purpose,
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:18.280]   they have a social security number.
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.400]   - They got 20 bucks, they seem very happy.
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:22.760]   - There you are with a clipboard, taking a survey.
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:27.760]   - Right, took a survey, went home, ordered their,
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:29.700]   and they, you know, of course they give me everything,
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:32.180]   name, date of birth, social security number,
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:34.100]   mother's maiden name, where they were born,
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:36.420]   have they ever been in the armed services,
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:38.020]   have they ever had a passport issued,
[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:39.980]   what states have they had identification in,
[02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:42.660]   have they ever been arrested, they ever been on probation,
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:46.580]   have they ever claimed social security disability, SSI.
[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:48.500]   I mean, I had like 17 questions
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:50.340]   and it absolutely answered everything.
[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:51.780]   What high school did you go to?
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:54.260]   'Cause high school transcripts are great for documentation.
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:56.060]   A lot of times they'll ask you for high school,
[02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:56.940]   you know, can you get us a copy
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:39:58.020]   of your high school transcripts?
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:39:59.420]   Like, that's a good deal.
[02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:01.380]   And I'm a big believer in overkill.
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:03.160]   So, I mean, I ordered a ton of stuff.
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:07.320]   If I needed three things to get a driver's license
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:09.040]   in your name, right?
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.160]   You know, I'd come in with like six.
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.480]   'Cause what you do is you get in front of the guy at the DMV
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:15.960]   and you kind of fumble through like,
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:18.040]   oh, I got this, what else do you need?
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:19.800]   You know, I know exactly what you need.
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.640]   But, you know, they'll be like,
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.840]   oh, is that high school transcript?
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:22.680]   Yeah, I'll take that.
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:25.560]   And oh, voter's registration card, give me that.
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:26.640]   Yeah, that's, you're perfect, you're good.
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:28.280]   Sit down right over there.
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:29.120]   That's it.
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:31.580]   - Who's, by the way, lurking in the shadows
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:32.840]   trying to catch you?
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:35.400]   You mentioned FBI, Secret Service.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.160]   You mentioned, I think I've heard you mention
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:40.160]   U.S. Marshals, which is interesting.
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:42.480]   Cops, in general, the police, CIA.
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.680]   I guess CIA is international only?
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:45.800]   FBI is internal?
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:46.640]   - Yes.
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:49.340]   - Okay, well, so who is, when you're doing this,
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:52.320]   who are you afraid of?
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.840]   - So, by the time I've gotten to Atlanta,
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.680]   within four or five days, the FBI raided my office.
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.960]   I guess I kind of missed that.
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:00.960]   - Back in Florida?
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:01.800]   - Back in Florida.
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.040]   When I left and drove to Atlanta and left,
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:08.000]   remember, the FBI was gonna show up a few days later.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:08.840]   They were gonna arrest me.
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:09.660]   - And they did?
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:10.500]   - They did.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:13.000]   They showed up like I left on a Sunday night or something.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.680]   Because for some reason, my stupid thought,
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.960]   I thought, well, they won't arrest me on the weekend.
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:20.800]   Like, they don't work on the weekends.
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:22.520]   So they came on like a, whatever it was,
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.320]   like a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday.
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:26.240]   Like, within a few days, they come in the office,
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:28.040]   they raid it, they're looking for me.
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:28.960]   But I'm gone.
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:30.580]   Nobody knows where I am.
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:33.760]   And so now I'm surveying the homeless guys
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:36.720]   and I turn around and I'm ordering their documents.
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.620]   And as their documents are showing up,
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:45.160]   you know, I'm going to different states and getting IDs.
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:48.720]   So I'm going to Florida.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:50.520]   So over the course of this whole thing,
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.520]   I've had 27 driver's licenses in like seven different states.
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:58.760]   I've had two dozen passports.
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:00.740]   Because if you're going to get the driver's license
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:04.340]   in the guy's name, you might as well get, or an ID even,
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:06.300]   you might as well get a passport.
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:08.400]   'Cause a passport's not difficult to get.
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:09.980]   They don't fingerprint you.
[02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:11.900]   You know, all they're doing is saying,
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:13.900]   "This is your ID and were you born here?"
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:15.140]   And then they run a check.
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:17.660]   And if it comes back or it doesn't.
[02:42:17.660 --> 02:42:19.140]   Back then you could do it expedited
[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:20.540]   and I'd have it in like two weeks.
[02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:22.340]   Like now it takes like 90 days
[02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:24.180]   or 60 to 90 days to get one.
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:26.700]   - And if you have multiple IDs for a single identity,
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:27.900]   that's more proof.
[02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:29.300]   - Right.
[02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:31.040]   - So wait, what number did you say?
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.760]   How many IDs, how many identities?
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.360]   - Well, I've had over 50 identities,
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:40.840]   but I've had 27 driver's licenses issued
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.740]   from state DMVs, Department of Motor Vehicles.
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:45.680]   - So like legitimately.
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:46.520]   - Legitimately.
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:51.420]   I walked into the DMV, said, "Hi, my name's Michael Eckert.
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:54.180]   "And I just moved here about three weeks ago,
[02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:57.000]   "four weeks ago, here's my lease."
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.300]   And I lost my driver's license, bro.
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:01.300]   Like, I don't know what I did with it.
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:02.920]   I don't know what happened, I don't know.
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:05.140]   And they're like, "It's all right, what do you have?
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:06.760]   "I need a proof of residency."
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:07.700]   "Well, I have my lease."
[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.200]   "Oh, okay."
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:13.620]   "I need a primary, okay, here's my birth certificate."
[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:16.340]   "Okay, and I need a secondary.
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:17.900]   "Here's my social security card."
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:20.860]   But I also registered, I registered to vote.
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:23.000]   My girlfriend made me vote immediately
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:23.840]   and she said I wouldn't need it.
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.060]   "Oh yeah, it's perfect, you're good.
[02:43:26.060 --> 02:43:27.340]   "I don't even need that."
[02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:29.280]   "Okay, great, stand over there.
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:32.180]   "Pay that person, they call your number, 275."
[02:43:32.180 --> 02:43:35.560]   You know, 45 minutes later, you go, you pay your 25 bucks,
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:37.780]   you stand in front of the screen, they take a picture,
[02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:38.700]   you got a driver's license.
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:40.940]   You walk out, it's still warm, it's beautiful.
[02:43:40.940 --> 02:43:43.820]   It smells like hot plastic, it's amazing.
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:48.820]   And so I'm opening up different bank accounts
[02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:51.520]   in these guys' names.
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:53.700]   And just about--
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:55.180]   - Yeah, sorry, well, what are you mostly doing
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:56.020]   with the identities?
[02:43:56.020 --> 02:43:57.660]   You're opening up different bank accounts.
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:59.900]   - Right now-- - Are you doing credit,
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:01.460]   starting to establish credit or no?
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:02.540]   - Some of them.
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:07.540]   Like I might order, I might order secured credit cards.
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:11.420]   So I can't get credit, you know, I'm building their credit.
[02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:12.780]   Like it's not helping me in any way.
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:16.780]   I'm just sending out $500 to get a Capital One card
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:20.060]   or a American, I'm sorry, a Bank of America
[02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:22.020]   secured credit card, whatever.
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:24.820]   So I'm building their credits.
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:26.860]   But not all of them, only a few,
[02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:29.540]   because although I'm collecting them,
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:32.020]   I'm also gonna be moving soon.
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:34.140]   I'm only here to get a few hundred thousand dollars
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:36.940]   and move, I need some kind of a base.
[02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:38.900]   So I don't wanna start getting credit cards
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:43.780]   and building up a history in Atlanta in anybody's name.
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:47.100]   But I am getting driver's licenses in other states.
[02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:49.860]   So I've been at like North Carolina, South Carolina.
[02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:52.420]   - What's the primary method of income here
[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:55.180]   when you move to a place, South Carolina,
[02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:57.980]   how do you make a hundred thousand at this time?
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:44:59.460]   - Right now I'm living in this guy's house
[02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:00.980]   and I satisfied his loans.
[02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:03.060]   The house is worth 200,000.
[02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:05.020]   So what happens is one day we go
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:06.780]   and we check public records.
[02:45:06.780 --> 02:45:09.020]   Remember I told you it takes months for it to show up
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:10.380]   and it shows up.
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:12.540]   He's got no mortgages on the house.
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:16.020]   So now I turn around and I make a fake ID
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:17.980]   in the name Michael Shanahan.
[02:45:19.620 --> 02:45:22.740]   And I'm living in his house, but I have no credit, right?
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:24.100]   There's no credit.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:29.100]   So I've got a social security number
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:32.980]   and I order some secured credit cards in his name.
[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:36.180]   So if you pull that credit profile,
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:38.880]   it shows up saying he's got some credit cards,
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:41.060]   but they're only a month or two old.
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:43.220]   So I can't go to like Bank of America.
[02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:48.220]   I mean, I could, but I needed to get the money
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:49.420]   as quick as possible.
[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:50.860]   I wanna get out of Atlanta.
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:53.540]   So, and at this point, by the way,
[02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:58.500]   there's multiple articles showing up in Tampa.
[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.100]   So the St. Petersburg Times
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:03.820]   is writing multiple articles about me.
[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:04.740]   - With your face.
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:06.300]   - With my picture, yeah.
[02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:08.820]   But it's honestly, it's pre, I mean, not pre-internet,
[02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:11.460]   but it's post-internet, but it's in its infancy.
[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:13.500]   Like nobody's, it's not huge.
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:18.500]   And honestly, it's a local newspaper in Tampa.
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:20.060]   It's not that big of a deal.
[02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:23.100]   Like I'm not concerned about that so much at this point.
[02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:25.180]   What I'm concerned about is getting a chunk of money
[02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:27.460]   and just moving on and kind of reestablishing ourselves
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:30.660]   in a better way where we're not living in a building
[02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:34.700]   that we're going to be committing fraud in with our house.
[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:37.100]   So, but I'm living in this place.
[02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:39.420]   I make a fake ID in the name Michael Shanahan
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:43.940]   and I call up three secured, or sorry,
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:45.900]   three hard money lenders.
[02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:49.300]   A hard money lender is a guy that lends his own money
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:53.140]   or other investors' money on property.
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.940]   Kind of like a bank, but he's lending his own money
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:59.460]   so he doesn't have to really meet the banking requirements.
[02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:01.420]   And he can charge a much higher interest rate.
[02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:05.300]   These guys are charging 12, 13% interest, simple interest.
[02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:09.300]   And they're only lending you a much lower percentage
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:11.580]   of the value of your home.
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:13.660]   So they're not lending you 90% of the value.
[02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:17.100]   They're lending you 65%, 60%.
[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:19.180]   So I call three of these guys.
[02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:21.460]   They all come out to the house at different times.
[02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:25.140]   And each one of them says, "I'll lend you 100,000,"
[02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:26.860]   or it's like 150,000, 150.
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:28.740]   Like they all lend roughly 150,000.
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:33.300]   So we schedule three separate closings.
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:35.780]   None of them know about the other person.
[02:47:35.780 --> 02:47:40.780]   So what I do is I close one loan on, let's say Monday,
[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:44.500]   and then one on Tuesday, and then one on whatever,
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:46.620]   Wednesday or Thursday, or that may have all been
[02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:48.340]   the same day, to be honest, but I don't remember.
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:51.900]   The point is, I go to three separate title companies
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:55.100]   or real estate attorneys and we close.
[02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:59.100]   And I get checks for, you know, after costs and everything.
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:01.420]   The total ends up being roughly 400,000.
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:04.180]   So I've got 400,000.
[02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:08.860]   Becky and I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida,
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:11.060]   and we get like 50 grand.
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:14.860]   And plus the 80, the 80 is dwindled down to close to nothing
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:16.720]   'cause we had gone on several vacations.
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.300]   We went to like Bermuda, and I think we went to Jamaica.
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:23.740]   We actually stayed at the Ritz in Jamaica.
[02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:25.820]   So it was very nice.
[02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:26.660]   - You and Becky.
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:29.140]   So Becky turned out to be pretty good
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:30.500]   in terms of scams on the road.
[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:31.620]   - No, she was useless.
[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:33.140]   She was horrible.
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:34.920]   And she just spent money all the time.
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.920]   And what I realized too, very quickly, is she's bipolar.
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:45.180]   So she's bipolar and she's absolutely insane.
[02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:47.980]   She smokes pot all the time.
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:50.660]   - Did that matter for you personally
[02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:54.240]   or did it actually affect how good you were able
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:56.440]   to do these particular scams?
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.180]   - It was that she was the type of person
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:03.380]   that would start an argument at one o'clock in the morning
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:08.660]   and scream at the top of her lungs and get the cops called.
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.020]   So I can't have the police called.
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:14.940]   I can't get taken downtown and fingerprinted.
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:17.140]   I can't have the police showing up.
[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:19.020]   I don't know who's really looking.
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:21.860]   We haven't had plastic surgery at this point.
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:23.620]   We're still pulling money together.
[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:27.580]   - Oh, Becky.
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:29.860]   - Yeah, Becky's a problem.
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:34.860]   And at some point, we send her to a psychiatrist
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:39.060]   and they give her, they put her on Zoloft.
[02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:42.800]   She takes it for like a month or two
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:43.920]   and then she stops taking it.
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.920]   She thought she was all better.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:48.200]   Like, you're not all better.
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.760]   - So can you give me a timeline here?
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:53.160]   How long are you able to be on the road here successfully?
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:53.980]   - Three years.
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:54.820]   - Three years.
[02:49:54.820 --> 02:49:55.640]   - This is me.
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:56.480]   This is the first few months.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:59.300]   - Three years, three years.
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:04.460]   - What happens is we get that little chunk of money.
[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:06.920]   We put it, deposit it in these bank accounts
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:08.620]   and we start pulling out cash,
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:13.680]   which works out fine 'cause we got a bunch of accounts
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:17.480]   and we're pulling out little amounts, 7,000, 5,000, 8,000.
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:20.600]   And I would cash checks against her accounts
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.640]   and they would call her to verify,
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:27.880]   there's someone here trying to cash a check for $9,000.
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:30.440]   Can you verify the payee?
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:32.800]   And they go, oh yeah, that's Scott Kugno.
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:33.620]   Oh, okay, thank you.
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:34.680]   And they cash the check.
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:37.400]   These are new accounts, so it looks odd.
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:40.400]   But we are always, I open the account.
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:43.120]   So what ends up happening is
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:49.280]   we're cashing 'em and I remember getting really frustrated
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:51.360]   'cause it was just taking forever.
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:53.560]   And I had gone into a bank one time
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:59.340]   and they have banks where they cash,
[02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:03.160]   they actually cash large checks.
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:04.220]   Like if you go into Bank of America
[02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:07.260]   and you try and cash a check for $15,000 or 25,000,
[02:51:07.260 --> 02:51:08.740]   they probably won't do it.
[02:51:08.740 --> 02:51:10.740]   They'll tell you we don't have that much cash on hand.
[02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:12.260]   We don't this, we don't that.
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:14.200]   They have certain banks that do that.
[02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:16.300]   So they told me where one of those was.
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:18.660]   I went there, I had a check for like 29,000
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:25.500]   that had been cut on a closing for Michael Shanahan.
[02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:27.520]   Remember, I refinanced Michael Shanahan's name.
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:31.340]   I've got a check for 29,000 that was issued to Scott Kugno.
[02:51:32.260 --> 02:51:33.720]   So I'm sitting in the bank, I go in there,
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:34.720]   I say, "I need to cash this."
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:36.800]   And she says, "You're gonna have to talk to the manager."
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:37.640]   I go, "Okay."
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:38.800]   She says, "Go sit down over there."
[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:41.360]   I go sit down in the little glass cubicle.
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:42.560]   He comes over and he says,
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:43.960]   "I see you're trying to cash this check."
[02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:44.800]   And I was like, "Right."
[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:46.340]   He goes, "Why don't you just deposit in your own bank?"
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:50.000]   And I went, "My bank is a credit union or something
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.620]   "and it's in like Florida.
[02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:53.580]   "Like they'll hold this thing for like two weeks.
[02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:57.680]   "Like I need the money now, I have people I need to pay."
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:01.440]   He's like, "Well, I'm not sure."
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:02.280]   And I was like, "Well, it's fine.
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:04.580]   "It's a cashier's check, like it's good."
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:05.840]   And he goes, "No, it's good.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:07.940]   "It's good, as you have the money."
[02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:09.300]   And he's like, "Yeah, we have the money."
[02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:10.700]   He said, "It's just odd."
[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:15.580]   Hold on, he goes back in the back and he comes back
[02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:19.180]   and he says, "Where'd you get the check, cashier's check?"
[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:20.300]   I said, "It was a cashier's check.
[02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:24.420]   "It was drawn off of a closing for somebody's property
[02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:27.500]   "that we're doing, the company I work for,
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.340]   "we're putting on an addition on."
[02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:31.800]   Okay, that makes sense.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:33.840]   Comes back, "Well, why do you need cash?"
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:35.780]   And I was like, "I'm cashing guys' checks
[02:52:35.780 --> 02:52:36.620]   "that work for the company.
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:37.460]   "Like there's a lot of these guys
[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:38.400]   "that are like Mexican guys.
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.240]   "They give them a check.
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:40.640]   "They go to a check cashing company
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:42.380]   "or they get charged five, 10%.
[02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:43.220]   "So I cashed them."
[02:52:43.220 --> 02:52:46.060]   I'm like, "I don't under, like, what?
[02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:47.680]   "The check's good, right?"
[02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:50.640]   Like my, and he's like, "Yeah, we're just trying
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:51.560]   "to verify some stuff."
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:55.520]   And he went, "Yeah, hold on."
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:56.440]   And he leaves again.
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:58.440]   And I remember my cell phone rang
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:52:59.960]   and I pick up the phone, it's Becky.
[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:00.800]   She, "What are you doing?
[02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:01.620]   "What's taking so long?"
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:02.540]   I go, "Ah, the guy's being a jerk.
[02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:04.120]   "He didn't want to give me the money."
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:05.580]   Oh, she's like, "Oh my God, get out of the bank.
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:06.820]   "Get out of the bank."
[02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:08.380]   And I'm like, "I can't get out of the bank.
[02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:09.860]   "The guy's got my ID.
[02:53:09.860 --> 02:53:14.020]   "He's got my credit card, my ID and the check for 29,000.
[02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:15.060]   "Like he's going to call the police
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:16.520]   "if I just jump up and run."
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:19.620]   And I go, "Look, don't call me again.
[02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:20.840]   "I'll let you know, it'll be fine.
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:21.840]   "Hang up the phone."
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:25.560]   She calls back, same conversation.
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:26.920]   "I'm bouncing off the walls.
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:27.760]   "I'm like, I'm going crazy.
[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:29.400]   "I'm like, I don't know, it'll be fine.
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:30.240]   "Hang up the phone."
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:33.360]   He comes back out and he goes, he said,
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:35.120]   "I said, hey, so what's taking so long?"
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:37.040]   And he goes, "We're trying to get in touch
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:40.260]   "with Michael Shanahan to verify the check."
[02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:42.920]   That's not good for me.
[02:53:42.920 --> 02:53:47.760]   Like, I'm thinking, right, right, okay, okay.
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:51.400]   And he walks away, the phone rings.
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:53.040]   It's Becky, "What's going on?"
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:53.880]   I go, "They're trying to get ahold
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:54.720]   "of Michael Shanahan."
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:58.480]   "Oh my God, oh my God."
[02:53:58.480 --> 02:53:59.320]   And I'm like, oh my God.
[02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:02.600]   And I remember thinking I shouldn't let her in the keys.
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:04.600]   There's a good chance I run out of this place
[02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:05.720]   and she's not there.
[02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:07.640]   - But by the way, when you're sitting there,
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:08.920]   who, Scott, you're Scott?
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:10.000]   - I'm Scott Cugno.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.400]   - And then he's calling Michael Shanahan.
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:13.360]   - Right, they're saying they're trying
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:15.080]   to get in touch with Michael Shanahan.
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:17.360]   So then the phone rings.
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:18.640]   My cell rings again.
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:21.800]   I look and it's not Becky's, not Becky.
[02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:23.120]   So I pick up the phone, I go, "Hello."
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:24.680]   And she says, "Hi, this is Kim."
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:26.000]   "Is it from SunTrust Bank?
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.960]   "Is this Michael Shanahan?"
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:31.800]   So I'm like, "Yes, it is Michael Shanahan."
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:33.300]   And she says, "There's a guy here.
[02:54:33.300 --> 02:54:34.420]   "He's trying to cash a check.
[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:35.300]   "It's very large.
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:36.600]   "Could you verify the payee?"
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:39.560]   And I go, "Sure, it's Scott Cugno."
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:41.840]   He's trying, I said, "I believe the amount's $29,000."
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:43.820]   And she goes, "That's right, thank you very much.
[02:54:43.820 --> 02:54:44.720]   "I appreciate it."
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:45.560]   I said, "Okay."
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.280]   I said, "Hey, by the way, how'd you get my number?
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:48.120]   "This is my cell number."
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:49.200]   And she's like, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:53.240]   "We called the title company.
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:57.040]   "And the title company gave us your phone number."
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:54:58.440]   "Well, I closed those loans.
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:54:59.280]   "That's my cell."
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.400]   That's why, if they'd looked in any other way,
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:04.280]   they could've gotten in touch
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:05.840]   with the real Michael Shanahan.
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:07.880]   So I was like, "Oh, okay."
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:09.200]   Hang up the phone.
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:12.040]   - You're sitting, you answered the phone from the bank
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.480]   while sitting in the bank as Scott Cugno.
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:17.760]   - As Scott pretending to be Michael.
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.760]   - So I just, right, so I just verified the check myself.
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:23.240]   - As Matthew pretending to be Scott
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:24.200]   as pretending to be Michael.
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:25.320]   - Right.
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:29.960]   So I wait there, terrified still.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:32.020]   They come out about two minutes later.
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:34.220]   The manager comes out, plus a woman.
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:35.520]   I'm assuming maybe that was Kim.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:36.560]   She never said anything.
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:38.280]   And she walks out and she says,
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.720]   and he counts out the money twice, 29,000, 29,000.
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:47.440]   And I stand up and I'm like shoving the money in my pockets.
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:48.580]   Like I'm trying to get out of there so quick.
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:49.420]   I'm like, "Hey."
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:50.560]   I'm like, "Okay, cool."
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.800]   Like I'm thinking this whole thing is, you know, feels bad.
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:59.520]   And I'm getting up and I'm starting to walk out of the bank
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:04.520]   and he goes, he said, "Excuse me, Mr. Cugno?"
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.080]   And I said, "Yes, sir."
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:08.460]   I turn around and he goes, "I'd like you to know
[02:56:08.460 --> 02:56:12.440]   "that I feel very apprehensive about this transaction."
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:13.680]   And I go, "Really?
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.240]   "What is it exactly?"
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:17.080]   He goes, "I can't put my finger on it."
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:18.400]   And I go, "It'll come to you."
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:21.040]   And I turn around, I just bolt right out of there.
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.120]   And just keep in mind, a week or so later,
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:25.120]   the Secret Service shows up.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:27.880]   "Did you cash a check for $29,000?"
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:30.500]   So what's so funny is like,
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:32.200]   that was one of the last checks we cashed.
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:33.980]   So we ended up with like 400,000.
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:35.680]   Was there a connection between the Secret Service
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.160]   and this guy?
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.560]   No. The apprehension?
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:41.480]   So the FBI is looking for me kind of in Tampa.
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:44.800]   And they've put out a fugitive warrant for me,
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:47.000]   which is how the U.S. Marshals got involved.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.960]   So the U.S. Marshals tracked down fugitives.
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:52.160]   Yes. Federal fugitives, they tracked down.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:55.440]   But everybody's after you.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.480]   You're on every list.
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:00.280]   Right. I'm on the FBI's most wanted list.
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.240]   At that point, the Secret Service got involved
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:04.840]   once I leave Atlanta.
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:09.320]   So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta,
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:11.200]   the Secret Service got involved.
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:16.200]   Because of identity theft, banking, identity theft,
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:19.760]   the Secret Service doesn't just do counterfeiting
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:20.800]   and protect the president.
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:23.600]   They also protect the financial infrastructure
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:24.440]   of the United States.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:26.720]   And they especially have jurisdiction
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:28.920]   when identity theft is involved.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:33.040]   So identity theft plus bank fraud, that's when they--
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:34.080]   They move, yeah, that's it.
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:36.480]   That's their territory.
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:37.320]   So they don't--
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:39.360]   And then U.S. Marshals are just fugitives?
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:40.520]   U.S. Marshals are just fugitives.
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:41.340]   They don't do any investigation.
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:42.840]   They're all kind of working, okay.
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:44.240]   But they're all kind of working together?
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.620]   Yeah, like the U.S. Marshals are, let's say,
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:53.620]   an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies,
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:57.480]   federal agencies, not the states.
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:59.560]   The states have their own fugitive task forces
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:00.800]   or fugitive--
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:03.940]   So when you leave Atlanta, basically everybody's after you.
[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:05.120]   Everybody's after me.
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:06.600]   Did you know this at that time?
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.360]   Or did you sense it?
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.900]   No, I mean, now every day you're looking up,
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:12.400]   you're just looking your name up every day.
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:15.760]   I'm not, 'cause I'm just trying to get a bunch of money
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:18.160]   and just blend in, right?
[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:20.720]   Things were not as interconnected at that time
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:21.800]   as they are now.
[02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:23.640]   But they're starting to get interconnected.
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:25.600]   But of course, I have no idea how much.
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:29.740]   I barely go on the internet for anything, dating.
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:31.160]   That's the only thing on the internet.
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:32.600]   I'd never been on Facebook.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:35.480]   At this point, Facebook isn't even out yet.
[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:38.160]   This is 2006.
[02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:39.840]   - Still, were you trying to stay low?
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:40.800]   - Yeah, I am.
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:42.320]   I'm not a flashy person.
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:44.300]   I'm not driving, like I didn't go out
[02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:47.040]   and buy a red Lamborghini.
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:51.320]   I'm driving $40,000, $50,000 cars.
[02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:53.720]   I've had some sports cars, 70, 80.
[02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:55.600]   Maybe that's $150,000 sports car now,
[02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:56.800]   but it's still not flashy.
[02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:58.760]   It's not like it's bright red or yellow.
[02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:03.760]   These are, it's always something nondescript.
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:06.600]   And I'm living in areas that these cars are everywhere.
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:10.960]   So I ended up going to Charlotte, North Carolina.
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:13.520]   We rent an apartment.
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:18.520]   We decide to run a scam in South Carolina.
[02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:22.200]   So I go to Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:27.200]   And in between this period of time, we go to Las Vegas.
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:32.300]   And I, when we go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money
[02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:37.980]   to Becky's son's father, who's taking care of her son.
[02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:40.480]   We drop off some money there.
[02:59:40.480 --> 02:59:42.840]   We go and we start, and while we're there,
[02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:45.540]   it's like, hey, there's homeless people here.
[02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:46.740]   So we.
[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:50.280]   - So you're always--
[02:59:50.280 --> 02:59:52.800]   - You know, usually I don't feel bad telling these stories.
[02:59:52.800 --> 02:59:54.320]   You make me feel bad.
[02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:56.360]   - I'm sorry, my judgment is showing.
[02:59:56.360 --> 02:59:59.400]   No, but you have to be collecting identities, I guess,
[02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:02.300]   to be constantly creating new identities.
[03:00:02.300 --> 03:00:04.760]   - So I got my survey forms.
[03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:09.760]   So I go and we go out and we're taking,
[03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:13.320]   I'm taking surveys and I end up going up to this guy.
[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:14.320]   It was like two or three guys
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:15.440]   that are standing on like a bench
[03:00:15.440 --> 03:00:16.840]   or sitting on next to a bench or something.
[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:19.160]   And I see him and I walk up and the guy,
[03:00:19.160 --> 03:00:20.240]   one guy gets up and he comes over.
[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:22.080]   He's like, hey, what do you need?
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:25.080]   And I went, I'm taking surveys for the Salvation Army
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:27.480]   to determine where we place our next homeless facility.
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:29.160]   And the guy goes, oh, I'm not interested.
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:29.980]   And they always said that.
[03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:31.560]   And I say, it pays 20 bucks cash right now.
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:33.000]   It'll take you five minutes.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.080]   And they're like, $20 cash right now.
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:36.560]   I was like, yeah, I show him the cash.
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:38.240]   And they go, okay, yeah, yeah, what do you need?
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:40.160]   Name, date of birth, social security number.
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:43.980]   So when I get to criminal record,
[03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:45.200]   the guy, he says, criminal record.
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:47.760]   He's like, yeah, I've been arrested.
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.080]   He's, I've been arrested like three, four times for,
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:51.840]   he said, for prostitution.
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:54.800]   He said, but they're like misdemeanors.
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:55.980]   And I went, okay.
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:01:01.480]   And it was like, okay, well, prostitution.
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:03.880]   To me, women get charged with prostitution.
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:05.740]   Men get charged with solicitation.
[03:01:05.740 --> 03:01:06.760]   I went, prostitution?
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.700]   And he goes, and he went, he said, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:12.120]   He said, I offered to blow an undercover cop for 20 bucks.
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:14.400]   He said, that's what I thought you were coming out here for.
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:17.040]   And I was like, no, no, bro.
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:17.920]   I said, okay.
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:19.680]   And he's like, yeah, he said, you know.
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:22.440]   He goes, I mean, he said, I mean, a girl's gotta do
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:23.280]   what a girl's gotta do.
[03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:25.000]   You know, and he made some comment or something.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.240]   I was like, okay.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:28.280]   So I jot down the rest of it.
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:29.100]   We're good.
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:29.940]   I give him 20 bucks.
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:30.760]   I get in my car.
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:31.600]   I leave.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:36.280]   We get back to North Carolina.
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:37.400]   I order all of his documents.
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:39.200]   His name was Gary Sullivan.
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:42.780]   I then go to South Carolina.
[03:01:42.780 --> 03:01:45.320]   When I go to South Carolina,
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:49.240]   I get a real estate agent.
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:51.280]   We drive around for a day.
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:52.920]   We look at like five or six houses.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:57.920]   I put five owner financing contracts
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:02:00.500]   on five different houses.
[03:02:00.500 --> 03:02:02.960]   So I get him, he writes up five contracts.
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:05.600]   All of them are asking for owner financing.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:07.680]   I'll put down 10%.
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:09.640]   I want owner financing.
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:11.480]   Two of them end up coming back and saying,
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:12.340]   yes, we'll do it.
[03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:15.440]   I have two closings.
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:18.520]   One of them's a house that's worth like 225,000.
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:20.320]   I put down 25 grand.
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:23.080]   Another one's 110,000.
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:24.880]   I put down 11,000.
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:27.080]   So I buy these two houses.
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:30.060]   I then satisfy the loans on both the houses.
[03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:33.880]   Everything seems like it's going okay.
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:37.120]   Although Becky's a lunatic at this point.
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:40.680]   She's had so many, she won't take her medication.
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:44.280]   She's had so many outbursts that,
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:46.680]   and we've had, by this time, we've had plastic surgery.
[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:48.720]   Like she's gotten plastic surgery.
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:50.200]   She's gotten a boob job.
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:52.560]   She's gotten liposuction.
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:55.460]   I mean, all kinds of stuff.
[03:02:55.460 --> 03:02:56.300]   So--
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:57.260]   - Look way different?
[03:02:57.260 --> 03:03:00.080]   Like appearance changes or?
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:02.980]   - Thinner, better looking, you know,
[03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:04.400]   just tightened everything up, I guess.
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:05.440]   You know, she was in her,
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:10.440]   she'd had a kid and she was 30, 33, 34.
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:13.000]   I don't know how she was, 20, 32, 33.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.680]   I don't know, roughly my age.
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:16.640]   So yeah, I thought she looked,
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:18.160]   you know, she lost like 15 pounds.
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:19.840]   Like she was, not 'cause of the surgery,
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:22.240]   but just in general, we're just working out.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:23.880]   We're going mountain climbing.
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:25.560]   We're, you know, riding bikes.
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:27.900]   We're doing, you know, fraud's not a full-time job.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:29.880]   So, you know, we have plenty of time.
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:32.020]   So we're goofing off.
[03:03:32.020 --> 03:03:36.920]   And, but she's also a lunatic.
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:38.720]   You know, she's getting the cops called.
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:41.400]   She's able to go out and she's able to stay stoned
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:42.520]   24 hours a day.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:46.280]   She's going out with friends, drinking.
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:48.040]   I never leave the house.
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:49.480]   You know, even to this day,
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:50.640]   I really barely ever leave the house.
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:52.980]   I'm very much a homebody kind of person.
[03:03:52.980 --> 03:03:56.920]   So like the idea that I'm able to make my living
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:03:59.840]   doing YouTube and I never have to leave my house.
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:01.040]   I love that.
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:03.180]   I don't ever go anywhere except for the gym and back home.
[03:04:03.180 --> 03:04:04.020]   That's it.
[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:08.580]   So what happens is I've actually moved her
[03:04:08.580 --> 03:04:11.020]   out of my apartment.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:13.820]   Like I had an apartment downtown, 30-story building.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:15.780]   Actually move her into another apartment.
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:16.980]   She's that much of a lunatic.
[03:04:16.980 --> 03:04:18.340]   We can't even be in the same place.
[03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:19.900]   Multiple times I've tried to leave her.
[03:04:19.900 --> 03:04:22.660]   She's called me up and begged me to come back.
[03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:23.700]   It's horrible.
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:25.580]   So I ended up buying a couple of houses
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:27.500]   in Columbia, South Carolina.
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:30.580]   I satisfy the loans on the houses.
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:33.620]   I've got an ID, not a driver's license,
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:36.320]   but an ID in the name of Gary Lee Sullivan.
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:41.860]   And I refinanced those houses
[03:04:41.860 --> 03:04:44.580]   'cause keep in mind there was owner financing,
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:45.740]   but they also had mortgages.
[03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:47.660]   So there's something called a wraparound mortgage.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:50.100]   So these guys did wraparound mortgages.
[03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:55.100]   So let's say you buy a house for $250,000
[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:58.260]   and the bank lends you 200,000.
[03:04:58.260 --> 03:05:00.760]   And then you owner finance the house to me.
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:03.360]   So we do a, I give you 50 grand down,
[03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:07.420]   but I'm not able to get a loan from the bank
[03:05:07.420 --> 03:05:08.340]   to pay off your mortgage.
[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:11.620]   So what we do is you do a wraparound mortgage.
[03:05:11.620 --> 03:05:15.380]   So I'll pay you your mortgage and you pay the bank.
[03:05:15.380 --> 03:05:17.460]   So there is a second mortgage on the property,
[03:05:17.460 --> 03:05:18.940]   but it's called a wraparound.
[03:05:18.940 --> 03:05:20.740]   It's wrapped around your first.
[03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:22.220]   - That's legal?
[03:05:22.220 --> 03:05:23.520]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:26.040]   So I wouldn't lie to you.
[03:05:26.040 --> 03:05:29.160]   So these have wraparound mortgages.
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:32.160]   - So you're always selling and you're good at it.
[03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:36.840]   - So I go, I satisfy the loans,
[03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:39.400]   the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages,
[03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:44.240]   and I satisfy the loans, the original loans
[03:05:44.240 --> 03:05:46.820]   that these people took out on their own mortgages.
[03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:49.040]   One of them, by the way,
[03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:53.080]   you have to sign as the president of the bank, right?
[03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:53.920]   - Yeah.
[03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:57.040]   - So I sign it as C. Montgomery Burns,
[03:05:57.040 --> 03:05:59.320]   which is the aging tycoon in the,
[03:05:59.320 --> 03:06:01.800]   the guy that owns a power plant in "The Simpsons" TV show.
[03:06:01.800 --> 03:06:03.920]   So I sign that and I notarize it,
[03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:04.880]   which I thought was cute.
[03:06:04.880 --> 03:06:07.720]   I actually wanted to sign all of them cartoon characters
[03:06:07.720 --> 03:06:09.840]   and Becky was screaming her head off
[03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:11.320]   and wouldn't let me do it, right?
[03:06:11.320 --> 03:06:13.440]   Like I wanted to do all the Simpsons, right?
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.560]   But she wouldn't let me do it.
[03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:15.480]   She's screaming and hollering.
[03:06:15.480 --> 03:06:18.580]   So I ended up, nobody knows who C. Montgomery Burns is.
[03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:20.800]   So I sign it, notarize it.
[03:06:20.800 --> 03:06:22.600]   All of those are satisfied.
[03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:27.400]   I then go to the multiple banks and I refinance,
[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:32.400]   start refinancing all these properties multiple times.
[03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:36.240]   So I'm applying for these loans and I'm getting the loans
[03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:37.080]   and I'm closing.
[03:06:37.080 --> 03:06:40.560]   So I've got like five or six loans on this one house.
[03:06:40.560 --> 03:06:42.640]   The house is like 225,000.
[03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:46.360]   I think it was like 230, whatever.
[03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:49.400]   I borrow like four or five loans on that house.
[03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:53.240]   So I borrow like $190,000 like five times.
[03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:55.320]   So I've got like $800,000.
[03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:58.000]   And then I borrow another three or 400,000
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.320]   on the other house, the one, the smaller one, right?
[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:02.520]   So it ends up being like $1.3 million.
[03:07:02.520 --> 03:07:05.500]   It's actually like 1.5 million.
[03:07:05.500 --> 03:07:08.180]   It was more, but what happened with that was,
[03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:11.280]   so keep in mind, you can only open up
[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:13.360]   so many bank accounts in your name.
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:15.060]   You can go to Bank of America, they'll open one.
[03:07:15.060 --> 03:07:16.720]   Then you go to SunTrust, they'll open one.
[03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:18.400]   They're gonna ask, they might even ask you,
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:21.800]   did you open another bank account today?
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:23.800]   'Cause every time you do it, there's an inquiry
[03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:27.760]   into something called check systems or AccuCheck.
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:30.040]   And so then they go, so then by the time you go
[03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:32.920]   to the third bank, they'll say, listen,
[03:07:32.920 --> 03:07:33.840]   something's not right.
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:36.240]   You've got multiple inquiries.
[03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:38.040]   You know, if you go to whatever, Mercantile Bank,
[03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:39.880]   there might be, they might go, okay, we're gonna open one.
[03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:41.080]   They're gonna need an explanation,
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:43.520]   but you're not opening more than three.
[03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:45.160]   By the third one, they're gonna be like, absolutely not.
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:46.680]   Something's wrong.
[03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:48.820]   So, you know, I've got multiple identities,
[03:07:48.820 --> 03:07:51.360]   but I can only open up so many banks.
[03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:54.200]   The other problem is that these checks,
[03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:56.540]   they'll only give you so much money on a refi,
[03:07:56.540 --> 03:07:58.240]   usually after $100,000.
[03:07:58.240 --> 03:07:59.380]   They only wanna let you walk away with,
[03:07:59.380 --> 03:08:01.440]   let's say, $100,000.
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:04.960]   So one of the things I did was I would typically record
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:07.600]   another mortgage and have them pay that mortgage off.
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:13.400]   So I had to open, I opened a corporation to do that,
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:14.440]   so I could then turn around
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:16.760]   and go open corporate bank accounts.
[03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:18.720]   'Cause now it's not going off my information,
[03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:20.200]   it's going off the corporation.
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:22.880]   So I can open up multiple corporate bank accounts.
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:24.640]   - These corporations are fake or real?
[03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:26.920]   - No, no, I went to a real corporate bank,
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:28.880]   corporate attorney and had him open 'em.
[03:08:28.880 --> 03:08:31.360]   I gave him, whatever, I gave him like $1,500, $2,000,
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:34.440]   and he opened up a corporation for me, Gary Sullivan.
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:36.200]   And I then turned around and I went
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:37.640]   and opened up multiple bank accounts
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:39.880]   in that corporation's name.
[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:41.240]   - How are you keeping track of all this,
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:42.920]   'cause this is, I don't, so I'm only--
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:44.440]   - Is this in your head or do you have good organization?
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:47.120]   - No, no, no, I have, every single identity
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:52.120]   has its own file with plastic inlays,
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:54.360]   sleeves for their passports.
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:55.200]   - That's nice and organized.
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:56.040]   - For all this, it's super organized.
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:58.560]   - So you open this, I'm Gary now.
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:00.160]   - Right, that's exactly what it is.
[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:01.640]   Like you kinda go over, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[03:09:01.640 --> 03:09:02.960]   you sit in your car for a minute,
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:04.540]   you put it down, you walk in.
[03:09:04.540 --> 03:09:09.840]   Well, what happens is, it went up to like 1.5 million,
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:11.320]   and I'm pulling money out of the bank,
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:13.080]   and then one day I get a phone call
[03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:15.740]   on Gary Sullivan's cell phone.
[03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:17.840]   The guy, it's a lawyer, they call up,
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:20.000]   he says, "Hey, I'm a lawyer with Washington Mutual,
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:21.280]   "we have an issue."
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:23.360]   I said, "What's that?"
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:26.000]   He says, "We got a phone call from the title company."
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.360]   One of the title companies that I was attempting
[03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:31.480]   to refinance one of the piece of property with,
[03:09:31.480 --> 03:09:34.720]   noticed that I, they had been sent,
[03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:36.840]   they'd been sent a document that showed
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:39.800]   that I had purchased the property,
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:42.160]   and I said I purchased it cash,
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:45.120]   and the document said I purchased it cash,
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:50.280]   and they got that, and there was actually a mortgage
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.320]   on the property, and so somehow or another,
[03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:55.320]   they connected it, and they called Washington Mutual,
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:57.540]   and they said, "Look, there's an issue.
[03:09:57.540 --> 03:09:59.440]   "We have a fraudulent document here."
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:02.980]   And he was like, he said, "So we went and we looked,
[03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:06.860]   "and it turns out that we pulled public records,
[03:10:06.860 --> 03:10:11.220]   "and that there is a mortgage in front of us,
[03:10:11.220 --> 03:10:13.320]   "several mortgages in front of us.
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:16.400]   "So there's like three or four mortgages in front of me,
[03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:19.140]   "Washington Mutual, you owe us."
[03:10:19.140 --> 03:10:23.460]   And it wasn't that much, it was like 100 grand, right?
[03:10:23.460 --> 03:10:27.900]   Like 95 or 100, and I said, "Okay."
[03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:30.220]   And he said, "So there's an issue here.
[03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:31.900]   "You've got a few mortgages in front of us,
[03:10:31.900 --> 03:10:34.120]   "and we're supposed to be a first mortgage,
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:36.040]   "and we're not supposed to be two mortgages behind,
[03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:36.880]   "or three."
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:40.280]   And I was like, "Okay, sounds like an error.
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:41.600]   "Not a big deal.
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:43.000]   "Have you contacted law enforcement?"
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:43.840]   He said, "No, I haven't.
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:45.880]   "I was hoping we could rectify this some other way."
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:47.280]   I said, "You know what, I think we can.
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:49.240]   "I'm gonna have my lawyer call you back.
[03:10:49.240 --> 03:10:50.620]   "I'm gonna go to his place right now.
[03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:52.440]   "Give me about two hours."
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:55.520]   No problem, I immediately run, jump in my car,
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:58.600]   head towards South Carolina, call my corporate lawyer,
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:00.340]   tell him, "Look, I need to talk to you.
[03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:01.240]   "Here's what's going on."
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:03.920]   I explain it to him, he doesn't really understand.
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:06.000]   He says, "This sounds pretty complicated.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:11.000]   "My law partner is a criminal defense attorney.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:15.200]   "I'm gonna set up a meeting right now with all of us."
[03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:17.720]   Okay, I get there 45 minutes later,
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:19.240]   I walk in the door, I sit down.
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:20.760]   He says, "What happened?"
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:24.280]   I said, "Gary, this doesn't sound right.
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:25.400]   "What happened?"
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:27.600]   I said, "Okay, so listen, bought this house.
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:31.200]   "I bought it cash, I then refinanced it."
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:32.480]   I didn't buy it cash.
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:34.000]   But I told him, I bought it cash,
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:37.560]   I refinanced it like four or five times
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:38.720]   within a day or two of each other.
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:40.320]   And they were like, "How is that even possible?"
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:41.680]   I was like, "Well, I went to different title companies."
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:42.680]   I explain how I do it.
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:44.840]   I said, "Washington Mutual just found out
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:47.900]   "that they're in like second position or third position."
[03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:50.220]   Or I said, "But they're probably,
[03:11:50.220 --> 03:11:51.600]   "they may be in fourth position.
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:54.520]   "They mail these things in, so you never know."
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:57.080]   And he was like, "Oh my God."
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:11:59.440]   He's like, "That's, what do you wanna do?"
[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:01.560]   I said, "I want you to contact them
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:04.340]   "and agree for them to not contact the authorities
[03:12:04.340 --> 03:12:07.000]   "provided I pay them off."
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:07.840]   He's, "Do you have the money?"
[03:12:07.840 --> 03:12:08.660]   I said, "I do have the money.
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:10.800]   "I can go get the money right now."
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:12.040]   He calls the lawyer.
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:14.660]   This is back when faxes, right?
[03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:16.400]   So they fax some documents back and forth.
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:19.400]   They do a couple emails back and forth.
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:21.760]   And they have a conversation.
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:23.320]   I remember the lawyer started arguing
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:26.780]   'cause he wanted to charge me like yield spread
[03:12:26.780 --> 03:12:27.760]   and fees and stuff.
[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:29.100]   And I was like, "What are you talking about?
[03:12:29.100 --> 03:12:30.320]   "Like, I'll pay it."
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:32.680]   So it ends up being a little over 100,000.
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:33.800]   And I'm like, "That's it."
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:35.440]   So he's like, "Okay."
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:39.640]   And so he says, "Okay, that sounds good."
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:41.760]   And so he said, "Okay, all you have to do
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:43.560]   "is go get the check."
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:46.060]   And he said, "Bring it to a Washington Mutual branch.
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:46.900]   "Tell them to call."
[03:12:46.900 --> 03:12:49.120]   I said, "I'm not going in a Washington Mutual branch, bro.
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:50.440]   "I'll bring you the check."
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:51.400]   So he calls him back.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:52.240]   He's not doing that.
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:54.460]   And he's like, "Okay, I'll bring it here.
[03:12:54.460 --> 03:12:55.300]   "You guys take care of it."
[03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.040]   He said, "No problem, okay."
[03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:59.380]   Hang up the phone and he turns to me and he says,
[03:12:59.380 --> 03:13:00.460]   "Okay, well, we have a problem."
[03:13:00.460 --> 03:13:01.400]   He said, "We still have the problem
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:03.700]   "of these other mortgages."
[03:13:03.700 --> 03:13:05.060]   And I went, "Right."
[03:13:05.060 --> 03:13:08.100]   And he said, and he goes, "Okay, well."
[03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:09.460]   I said, "They don't know anything."
[03:13:09.460 --> 03:13:11.600]   He said, "I know, but Gary," he said,
[03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:14.020]   "What if they find out?"
[03:13:14.020 --> 03:13:15.860]   I said, "They find out that they're like in second,
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:17.460]   "third, and fourth place?"
[03:13:17.460 --> 03:13:18.300]   He's like, "Right."
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:20.380]   I said, "I leave town."
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:22.100]   And he went, so they both laugh.
[03:13:22.100 --> 03:13:25.200]   They go, "Gary, you can't just leave town."
[03:13:26.140 --> 03:13:28.280]   They have a copy of your driver's license.
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:29.600]   They have your social security number.
[03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:30.800]   They have your birth certificate.
[03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:31.820]   I said, "They'll find you.
[03:13:31.820 --> 03:13:33.080]   "It's the FBI."
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:36.280]   And I go, "You're assuming I'm Gary Sullivan."
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:37.840]   - Wow, you tell 'em.
[03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:40.400]   - And they, listen, they looked at me and they went.
[03:13:40.400 --> 03:13:44.600]   And I remember he said, he goes,
[03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:47.600]   "We'll cross that bridge when we get to it."
[03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:49.260]   I said, "Right, my immediate problem
[03:13:49.260 --> 03:13:51.240]   "is getting rid of these people."
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:52.760]   And he goes, "Right, right."
[03:13:53.660 --> 03:13:57.920]   So I go get the check, bring it back, give it to them.
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:59.960]   Never called the FBI.
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:02.680]   - Can't believe you got away with the Washington Mutual.
[03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:04.360]   - Oh, bro, this is--
[03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:07.660]   - I mean, these are all really close calls, it seems like.
[03:14:07.660 --> 03:14:09.880]   - No, this is the close call.
[03:14:09.880 --> 03:14:11.040]   I have two more close calls
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:14.440]   that my hands sweat thinking about it.
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:20.040]   I walk into Wachovia.
[03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:22.200]   I just opened this account two months ago.
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:23.320]   So it's a new account.
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:24.480]   So whenever I would go in there, I'd say,
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:28.640]   "Hey, I need $7,000, $6,000, anything over $3,000."
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:30.680]   They had to call to get permission, right?
[03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:32.640]   Like authorization.
[03:14:32.640 --> 03:14:34.100]   So she's like, "Okay, I gotta go call."
[03:14:34.100 --> 03:14:35.280]   I said, "No problem."
[03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:37.680]   So the girl walks in the back.
[03:14:37.680 --> 03:14:38.600]   I'm sitting there waiting.
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:43.600]   All of a sudden, a massive person
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:46.160]   reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist.
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:47.640]   And somebody grabs it from the other one
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:49.940]   and they pull my hands behind my back.
[03:14:49.940 --> 03:14:51.720]   These are two of possibly
[03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:53.280]   the largest law enforcement officers
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:54.880]   I've ever seen in my entire life.
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:56.680]   I mean, they're massive.
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:00.920]   And they handcuff me and they say,
[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:05.420]   "You're Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained.
[03:15:05.420 --> 03:15:09.020]   "We're taking you into custody and putting you,
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:12.080]   "we're holding you until a detective gets here."
[03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:12.920]   - Who are these guys?
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:15.360]   Is this U.S. Marshals or is this cops or what?
[03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:16.720]   - These are sheriff's deputies.
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:17.720]   - Sheriff's deputies.
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:20.800]   - And as they walk me in the back,
[03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:22.680]   they're calling me Mr. Sullivan.
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:24.680]   They sit me down.
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:29.000]   And by now, the Secret Service are looking for me.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:30.280]   They're calling me,
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:32.640]   well, they were calling us John and Jane Doe,
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:34.660]   but now they figured out who we were.
[03:15:34.660 --> 03:15:37.800]   And so now I'm on the Secret Service's most wanted list.
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:41.000]   I'm not like number one at that.
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:42.200]   Right, like I probably was,
[03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:45.720]   but we just found out I was on that list.
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:47.340]   So it's getting bad.
[03:15:47.340 --> 03:15:49.360]   So they sit me down and I'm waiting.
[03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:52.400]   And I remember thinking that the FBI was coming.
[03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:54.400]   I don't really know.
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:55.240]   At that point,
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:57.060]   I couldn't tell you the difference between everybody.
[03:15:57.060 --> 03:16:00.000]   And then five minutes go by and I'm sitting there going,
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:00.840]   "What is going on?
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:01.880]   "Do you guys have any idea what's going on?"
[03:16:01.880 --> 03:16:03.400]   They're like, "We don't know.
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:04.440]   "We're just grunts.
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:05.780]   "We just do what we're told."
[03:16:05.780 --> 03:16:07.480]   So suddenly this guy walks in.
[03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:10.080]   He's probably in his early 30s maybe.
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:12.600]   He walks in, gray suit.
[03:16:12.600 --> 03:16:14.160]   I think he looks like he's FBI.
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:16.660]   He says, "Hey, I'm a detective with the,
[03:16:16.660 --> 03:16:19.520]   "I wanna say Richland County, whatever,
[03:16:19.520 --> 03:16:22.220]   "sheriff's department or police department, whatever."
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:23.220]   And I was like, "Oh, okay."
[03:16:23.220 --> 03:16:24.800]   And he says, "Yeah, listen, we've got an issue.
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:28.660]   "Wachovia, Wachovia wants us to arrest you."
[03:16:28.660 --> 03:16:31.700]   He said, "They're saying that you've got
[03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:35.860]   "three mortgages on your house."
[03:16:35.860 --> 03:16:38.220]   And I go, "Is that illegal?"
[03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:39.680]   And he looked at me and he went,
[03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:42.180]   "You know, to be honest, I don't know."
[03:16:42.180 --> 03:16:44.140]   And I distinctly remember thinking,
[03:16:44.140 --> 03:16:45.480]   "I'm walking out of here.
[03:16:45.480 --> 03:16:46.840]   "All I have to do is convince this guy
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:47.860]   "I haven't done anything wrong.
[03:16:47.860 --> 03:16:49.760]   "He's already said he doesn't know."
[03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:51.240]   So he gets on the phone with the head
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:53.620]   of Wachovia's fraud department.
[03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:56.360]   And he's saying, "This guy is running
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:16:58.940]   "what's called a shotgunning scam."
[03:16:58.940 --> 03:17:00.540]   Which is absolutely right.
[03:17:00.540 --> 03:17:02.280]   And so-- - What is a shotgunning?
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:06.360]   - It's where you close on so many loans simultaneously,
[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:07.840]   they can't catch it.
[03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:11.240]   Anyway, they start going back and forth.
[03:17:11.240 --> 03:17:13.580]   And he's on the phone and he's like,
[03:17:13.580 --> 03:17:15.040]   "Why did you close three loans?"
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:18.440]   And I said, "I, you know, why are you pulling?"
[03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:19.480]   I said, "It's not illegal.
[03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:21.440]   "I have a first mortgage, a second mortgage,
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:23.680]   "and a home equity line of credit.
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:25.260]   "That's perfectly legal."
[03:17:25.260 --> 03:17:26.480]   And he goes, and you could hear the guy,
[03:17:26.480 --> 03:17:28.440]   "Yeah, they're all first mortgages."
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:30.160]   And I said, "I read every one of those documents.
[03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:32.300]   "Not one of them said they were first mortgages,
[03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:33.220]   "and they don't.
[03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:35.080]   "First mortgages don't say they're first mortgages.
[03:17:35.080 --> 03:17:37.120]   "It's the placement of the mortgage.
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:38.380]   "It's placement of the lien that determines
[03:17:38.380 --> 03:17:40.340]   "is it a first, second, or third.
[03:17:40.340 --> 03:17:42.960]   "So it's possible that I wouldn't have known it,
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:44.560]   "certain that I could have read those documents
[03:17:44.560 --> 03:17:45.440]   "and not known."
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:47.800]   And he's like, "That's not true."
[03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:48.920]   And he's screaming.
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:51.640]   And so I go, "Yeah, listen."
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:53.840]   And he said, "Well, you're taking out all cash.
[03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:54.880]   "Why are you taking out all cash?"
[03:17:54.880 --> 03:17:56.620]   I said, "Well, I mean, I don't know if this sounds,
[03:17:56.620 --> 03:17:57.980]   "I don't know, this might be illegal."
[03:17:57.980 --> 03:17:58.820]   I said, "I don't know."
[03:17:58.820 --> 03:18:03.820]   I said, "I mean, I work for a labor company,
[03:18:03.820 --> 03:18:05.580]   "labor on demand."
[03:18:05.580 --> 03:18:09.560]   I pull out my business card.
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:10.840]   You can call.
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:12.520]   So I'm like, "I work for labor on demand."
[03:18:12.800 --> 03:18:15.760]   And I said, "We hire a lot of guys
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:16.800]   "that like they don't have banking out.
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:18.520]   "So the company pays them.
[03:18:18.520 --> 03:18:20.560]   "And then usually I'll pull out money
[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:22.540]   "and I'll cash their checks
[03:18:22.540 --> 03:18:23.800]   "because they get charged like 10%
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:25.660]   "of these cashing companies and I feel bad.
[03:18:25.660 --> 03:18:26.680]   "I know the checks are good.
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:27.960]   "So I just deposit them.
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:28.800]   "I mean, I don't think that."
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:30.200]   I said, "But I don't know if that's illegal.
[03:18:30.200 --> 03:18:32.040]   "I don't think that's illegal."
[03:18:32.040 --> 03:18:33.500]   And he's like, "No, no, no, that's fine.
[03:18:33.500 --> 03:18:34.400]   "That's a decent thing to do.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:35.520]   "It's not, that's fine."
[03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:37.320]   I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:39.720]   So he's talking to the guy
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:42.120]   and Wachovia is screaming and hollering.
[03:18:42.120 --> 03:18:45.840]   He says, "He's doing that."
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:47.220]   He's going back and forth, back and forth.
[03:18:47.220 --> 03:18:49.240]   So we're going back and forth
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:18:53.400]   and I'm just derailing everything this guy says.
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:57.440]   And at one point he says, he's screaming,
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:18:59.960]   he's committing fraud, we want him arrested.
[03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:02.000]   And he's like, "I don't know what to charge him with."
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:07.000]   And he's like, he's saying these aren't...
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:11.920]   He's like, "Hey, look, how did you even do this?
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:14.800]   "So I go, look, I didn't do this."
[03:19:14.800 --> 03:19:17.320]   I said, "I came to Wachovia, I met with a loan officer.
[03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:18.480]   "I said, I need a first mortgage.
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:19.840]   "I need to pull out like $100,000.
[03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:21.320]   "I wanna start buying houses."
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:22.160]   He goes, "That's right.
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:23.360]   "You own another house here too, don't you?"
[03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:24.720]   I said, "I do."
[03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:26.040]   I said, "We're putting a new roof on it.
[03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:27.100]   "We're gonna build an addition.
[03:19:27.100 --> 03:19:28.180]   "We're putting in a pool.
[03:19:28.180 --> 03:19:29.960]   "I'm buying one right down the street from that one."
[03:19:29.960 --> 03:19:33.320]   I said, "So obviously I'm pulling out money."
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:36.360]   I said, "So I told them I need $100,000."
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:37.560]   They said, "That's fine."
[03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:40.380]   They said they could only get me $100,000 out.
[03:19:41.220 --> 03:19:43.940]   Something about Fannie Mae guidelines, which is true.
[03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:47.980]   And I said, "So then she said I can get you,
[03:19:47.980 --> 03:19:49.840]   "I can send you to a friend of mine who's a loan officer.
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:51.940]   "She can get you a second mortgage," which she did.
[03:19:51.940 --> 03:19:54.180]   I said, "Then I told her she could only get me
[03:19:54.180 --> 03:19:56.780]   "100,000 or so, 190,000."
[03:19:56.780 --> 03:19:59.080]   And she said, "You should get an equity line of credit
[03:19:59.080 --> 03:20:02.780]   "if you're gonna be doing like renovating properties."
[03:20:02.780 --> 03:20:03.820]   So she sent me to somebody
[03:20:03.820 --> 03:20:05.020]   and they got me an equity line of credit.
[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:09.420]   I said, "I haven't committed fraud."
[03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:11.180]   I said, "I wouldn't know how to commit fraud
[03:20:11.180 --> 03:20:12.020]   "if you told me."
[03:20:12.020 --> 03:20:14.540]   I said, "What sounds more reasonable?"
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:16.500]   A guy that worked for a labor company
[03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:21.840]   ripped off a bunch of banks for over half a million dollars.
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:24.200]   I said, "Or some loan officers got together
[03:20:24.200 --> 03:20:25.700]   "and did something illegal."
[03:20:25.700 --> 03:20:28.100]   I said, "There's a problem at the bank."
[03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:31.020]   And he says, "I think you've got a problem at the bank."
[03:20:31.020 --> 03:20:32.860]   And this guy goes nuts.
[03:20:32.860 --> 03:20:35.140]   And while he's screaming, he needs to be arrested.
[03:20:35.140 --> 03:20:36.000]   This is fraud.
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:38.740]   My loan officers have not done anything illegal.
[03:20:38.740 --> 03:20:40.460]   They wouldn't do that.
[03:20:40.460 --> 03:20:42.220]   He says, "Look at his ID."
[03:20:42.220 --> 03:20:44.100]   His ID is fake.
[03:20:44.100 --> 03:20:46.580]   His ID starts with zero, zero, zero.
[03:20:46.580 --> 03:20:51.460]   South Carolina IDs start with zero, zero, zero.
[03:20:51.460 --> 03:20:53.300]   This guy's in California.
[03:20:53.300 --> 03:20:54.780]   He has no idea.
[03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:56.240]   So when he says that,
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:01.600]   the detective looks at my ID and he goes,
[03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:06.120]   "Listen," he said, "This is a real ID.
[03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:08.600]   "I ran this guy through NCIC."
[03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:11.600]   He said, "This is Gary Sullivan."
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:15.320]   And I looked at him, I go, "Now I'm not Gary Sullivan?"
[03:21:15.320 --> 03:21:17.320]   I go, "Come on, bro, what are we doing here?"
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:19.200]   And he goes, "I know, Gary, I know."
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:23.360]   And he says, "I'm gonna take him downtown.
[03:21:23.360 --> 03:21:26.800]   "I'm going to talk to my," whatever,
[03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:28.360]   "lieutenant, whoever, captain,
[03:21:28.360 --> 03:21:30.120]   "and I'm gonna fill out a police report
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:31.720]   "and I'll let you know."
[03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:32.560]   And he hangs up.
[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:34.720]   I get up.
[03:21:34.720 --> 03:21:36.580]   They've taken the handcuffs off.
[03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:38.520]   I stand up.
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:41.320]   As we're walking out with the detectives,
[03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:43.020]   as we're all kind of walking out, he goes,
[03:21:43.020 --> 03:21:44.200]   "Hey, you have an ID.
[03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:46.440]   "Do you have a driver's license?"
[03:21:46.440 --> 03:21:49.780]   And I went, "Um, I do, but it's in Nevada."
[03:21:49.780 --> 03:21:51.920]   And he goes, "Oh, that's right."
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.720]   He goes, "You're from Vegas."
[03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:57.900]   And he looks at the two deputies and they all kind of grin.
[03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:01.920]   And I think, "He ran me through NCIC,"
[03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:05.600]   which means he ran a statewide criminal database,
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:07.360]   which means he thinks I've been arrested
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:09.440]   three times for prostitution in Vegas.
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:10.920]   - Ah, right.
[03:22:10.920 --> 03:22:13.340]   - Listen, I'm humiliated.
[03:22:13.340 --> 03:22:16.800]   I was just like, and the grin told me,
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:19.400]   and I was just like, "Oh, man."
[03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:22.800]   And so one of the cops goes, "Here, give me the ID."
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:23.640]   Takes the ID.
[03:22:23.640 --> 03:22:25.080]   He goes, "I'll check and see."
[03:22:25.080 --> 03:22:27.240]   'Cause I have to follow him back in my car.
[03:22:28.360 --> 03:22:30.560]   So he goes, and by the way,
[03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:35.460]   my car is in the name Michael Eckert.
[03:22:35.460 --> 03:22:37.720]   So Michael Eckert, he doesn't have a photograph
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:40.940]   of Michael Eckert because you can't pull up photographs
[03:22:40.940 --> 03:22:42.300]   from other states.
[03:22:42.300 --> 03:22:44.560]   So he doesn't have a photograph,
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:46.760]   but he knows that's not my car.
[03:22:46.760 --> 03:22:48.280]   And he asked me, "Whose car are you driving?"
[03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:50.240]   I said, "Oh, that's my boss, Michael Eckert."
[03:22:50.240 --> 03:22:51.320]   I said, "That's my boss."
[03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:52.160]   And he goes, "Oh, Michael Eckert."
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:53.560]   I said, "Yeah, exactly."
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:55.680]   And he's like, and I'm like, "Oh, my God."
[03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:58.160]   So I'm thinking he knows Michael Eckert.
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:00.520]   Knows it's registered in North Carolina.
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:03.000]   Knows the address, which is where I was currently living.
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:04.220]   That's a problem.
[03:23:04.220 --> 03:23:07.320]   So the police officer or the, I'm sorry,
[03:23:07.320 --> 03:23:11.080]   deputy grabs the ID, walks outside, comes back.
[03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:12.640]   I have no idea if this homeless guy
[03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:14.880]   has a driver's license in Nevada.
[03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:15.720]   I don't know.
[03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:17.080]   He had nothing on him.
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:19.600]   He comes back and he goes, "Does he have a valid license?"
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:20.840]   He goes, "Yeah, it's valid."
[03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:24.040]   And he hands it to him, or he hands me the ID.
[03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:26.400]   And he says, he goes, "It's valid?"
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:29.120]   And he looked at me, he goes, "Yeah, well."
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:32.480]   He said, "It says he's like, he says he's five foot 11."
[03:23:32.480 --> 03:23:35.200]   Like, it was like 5'10", 5'11".
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:36.960]   I'm clearly not 5'10" or 5'11".
[03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:38.680]   And they all look at me and I go,
[03:23:38.680 --> 03:23:40.960]   "Fellas, with a good pair of shoes."
[03:23:40.960 --> 03:23:45.800]   Like that, and they all go, "Ha, ha, ha, follow us, Gary."
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:48.720]   I follow them back to the police station.
[03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:53.480]   Becky is calling me on the phone, screaming her head off.
[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:55.920]   Now, I'd always told Becky,
[03:23:55.920 --> 03:23:58.260]   "If I ever get arrested,
[03:23:58.260 --> 03:24:04.280]   immediately go get me a lawyer.
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:06.520]   The lawyer will be able to get me out on bond
[03:24:06.520 --> 03:24:09.080]   'cause I'll be arrested for something stupid."
[03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:11.960]   I said, "It'll be something like trying to cash a check,
[03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:15.040]   you know, a fake check or a use of something."
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:16.800]   I said, "It won't be, all my IDs are real.
[03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:18.200]   So it won't be for a fake ID.
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:20.680]   So my ID won't be in question."
[03:24:20.680 --> 03:24:25.680]   Most police departments and sheriffs at that time
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:30.000]   did not run your fingerprints through AFIS.
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.520]   So they didn't, 'cause they charge them for that.
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:33.720]   So they don't typically do it
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:35.280]   unless your identity is in question.
[03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:36.120]   Mine wouldn't be.
[03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:39.800]   I have a valid driver's license or a valid ID in that state.
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:41.340]   So I go back, she's screaming.
[03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:43.320]   She's like, "Oh my God, you don't understand.
[03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:48.320]   I just checked the internet, the website.
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:51.200]   You are number one
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:53.960]   on the Secret Service's most wanted list."
[03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:56.280]   And I was like, "I got bigger problems right now.
[03:24:56.280 --> 03:24:57.320]   They just held me in the bank.
[03:24:57.320 --> 03:24:59.800]   I'm following them right now."
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:03.360]   And she was like, "Get on the interstate, go, go."
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:04.280]   I cannot go.
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:06.040]   The detective's in front of me.
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:07.740]   The cops are behind me.
[03:25:07.740 --> 03:25:09.080]   They're escorting me to the police.
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:10.720]   Listen, she's like, "Oh my God, run, run."
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:13.600]   I go, "Look, I'm not a NASCAR driver.
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:17.040]   Like I'm driving, it's a sports car,
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:19.060]   but it's not gonna outrun a radio or a helicopter.
[03:25:19.060 --> 03:25:20.400]   Like I'm not, that's not gonna happen.
[03:25:20.400 --> 03:25:21.920]   I know it looks, it seems nice.
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:22.920]   I'm not that guy."
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:24.840]   So I was like, "I can't."
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:25.660]   I said, "Look, you don't understand.
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:27.000]   I was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.240]   I just talked my way out of them.
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:29.560]   I'm gonna get out of this."
[03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:33.160]   And I said, "The worst that happens is I'll be arrested
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:36.080]   as Gary Sullivan.
[03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:41.000]   You can get me a police, you can get me an attorney.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:42.080]   He can get me out."
[03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:44.800]   And she goes, "I'm not getting you an attorney.
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:46.800]   I'm not getting you out on bond.
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:50.340]   I'm not risking everything I've got for you."
[03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:52.180]   Because she has all the money.
[03:25:52.180 --> 03:25:55.680]   We've got seven, $800,000 at this point.
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:26:00.700]   Oh, and by the way, she's not even in North Carolina
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:01.540]   at this point.
[03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:04.980]   She's relocated to Houston, Texas.
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:08.280]   Because when this scam fell apart,
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:10.380]   we were gonna move to Texas.
[03:26:10.380 --> 03:26:12.340]   So we were already moving there.
[03:26:12.340 --> 03:26:16.420]   - But by the way, just a small tangent,
[03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:19.420]   where do you store money in situations like this that,
[03:26:19.420 --> 03:26:22.300]   like when you talk about 800,000,
[03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:23.940]   do you have to keep moving accounts
[03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:27.140]   to make sure it's not accessible by FBI?
[03:26:27.140 --> 03:26:29.300]   - Well, there's about 600,000 or 700,000 accounts,
[03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:31.640]   but keep in mind, I'm getting that out in cash.
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:33.680]   Like there's no Bitcoin, there's no,
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:34.900]   none of that stuff exists.
[03:26:34.900 --> 03:26:37.940]   So my, you know, I probably should have bought diamonds
[03:26:37.940 --> 03:26:40.660]   or bought gold or bought, like, I don't know any of that.
[03:26:40.660 --> 03:26:43.840]   All I could think of is go in slowly, be patient.
[03:26:45.620 --> 03:26:48.260]   Don't drain the accounts, you know, fluctuate them.
[03:26:48.260 --> 03:26:51.080]   Like I was writing, getting cashier's checks
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:53.260]   from one account to another.
[03:26:53.260 --> 03:26:55.340]   So the balances were doing this, you know,
[03:26:55.340 --> 03:26:58.020]   they weren't just going, they were doing this.
[03:26:58.020 --> 03:26:59.580]   And then one day, boom, they're gone.
[03:26:59.580 --> 03:27:00.540]   - Okay, got it.
[03:27:00.540 --> 03:27:04.380]   - So we got out like whatever,
[03:27:04.380 --> 03:27:06.380]   we got, we've gotten out like six or 700,000.
[03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:08.940]   There's still like six or 700,000 in the bank,
[03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:10.740]   but I'm not going back, I'm done.
[03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:11.980]   I actually, to be honest with you.
[03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:14.700]   So, well, look, I go in.
[03:27:14.700 --> 03:27:16.840]   So I go into the police station.
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:21.820]   And well, first she says, if you go in the police station,
[03:27:21.820 --> 03:27:22.860]   I'm done.
[03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:24.460]   If you get arrested, you're done.
[03:27:24.460 --> 03:27:26.120]   I said, well, I better not get arrested.
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:29.060]   I hang up the phone, cop standing behind my car.
[03:27:29.060 --> 03:27:30.860]   Get out, I go in the police station.
[03:27:30.860 --> 03:27:34.020]   I walk in, I fill out the police report.
[03:27:34.020 --> 03:27:36.740]   He tells me I got to talk to my captain real quick.
[03:27:36.740 --> 03:27:37.580]   Can you wait?
[03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:38.900]   He couldn't leave me in his cubicle.
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:40.340]   He goes, can you wait in the hallway?
[03:27:40.340 --> 03:27:41.460]   I can't leave you in the,
[03:27:41.460 --> 03:27:42.460]   I said, no, no problem.
[03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:43.860]   So I go and I wait in the hallway.
[03:27:43.860 --> 03:27:46.820]   In the hallway are a whole wall full of,
[03:27:46.820 --> 03:27:50.080]   on the cork board, wanted posters.
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:51.100]   Black and white, black and white.
[03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:53.660]   Like, you know, car thief, you know, rapist,
[03:27:53.660 --> 03:27:58.300]   murderer, Secret Service's most wanted.
[03:27:58.300 --> 03:28:01.020]   And I'm on the, on my face is right there.
[03:28:01.020 --> 03:28:03.780]   I'm like, holy Jesus.
[03:28:03.780 --> 03:28:06.940]   And, you know, everything in me told me,
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:08.660]   run, bro, just fucking haul ass right now.
[03:28:08.660 --> 03:28:09.820]   Right now, just go.
[03:28:09.820 --> 03:28:12.020]   Your luck's run out.
[03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:13.020]   Not that I even thought he was,
[03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:15.860]   there were so many, I didn't think he was gonna see it.
[03:28:15.860 --> 03:28:19.260]   But it just, everything in me just said, run.
[03:28:19.260 --> 03:28:22.260]   The problem is if you've ever been into a police station,
[03:28:22.260 --> 03:28:23.660]   you're not getting out of it.
[03:28:23.660 --> 03:28:24.480]   Do you understand?
[03:28:24.480 --> 03:28:26.020]   - There's a lot of cops around.
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:28.700]   - Well, not just that, but they buzz you in.
[03:28:28.700 --> 03:28:30.860]   You get in the elevator, you have to punch in a code.
[03:28:30.860 --> 03:28:32.780]   You have to punch in a code to get back out of the elevator.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:34.460]   You have to punch in a code to get into the next door.
[03:28:34.460 --> 03:28:37.940]   There's like, I mean, it was, it's impossible.
[03:28:37.940 --> 03:28:40.140]   Like, I'm never, I'm not gonna get in the elevator.
[03:28:40.140 --> 03:28:42.980]   So, guy comes back up, the cop comes back up.
[03:28:42.980 --> 03:28:46.300]   He said, hey, Gary, appreciate it, no problem.
[03:28:46.300 --> 03:28:47.580]   My captain said, we're good.
[03:28:47.580 --> 03:28:49.380]   We're gonna wait for a phone call from the,
[03:28:49.380 --> 03:28:52.980]   no, the district attorney called already.
[03:28:52.980 --> 03:28:54.260]   They're looking into it.
[03:28:54.260 --> 03:28:57.480]   I'm gonna go ahead and let you go.
[03:28:57.480 --> 03:29:00.740]   I go downstairs, he walks me out to my car.
[03:29:00.740 --> 03:29:02.980]   He said, look, do me a favor.
[03:29:02.980 --> 03:29:05.260]   He's like, we do have some serious questions at this point.
[03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:06.260]   Like, the district attorney said,
[03:29:06.260 --> 03:29:09.060]   there's something is up.
[03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:11.580]   He said, I said, not with me.
[03:29:11.580 --> 03:29:13.300]   And he said, well, just do me a favor.
[03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:14.740]   He goes, don't leave town.
[03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:16.300]   I said, bro, I own two houses here.
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:17.620]   I'm not going anywhere.
[03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:18.460]   I said, I'm telling you right now.
[03:29:18.460 --> 03:29:20.940]   I said, Wachovia, they fucked up.
[03:29:20.940 --> 03:29:22.860]   And he's like, I believe you, I believe you.
[03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:24.020]   He said, whatever, he said, whatever.
[03:29:24.020 --> 03:29:25.500]   He's like, I hope you, I hope they were right.
[03:29:25.500 --> 03:29:26.900]   I'm sure you're right.
[03:29:26.900 --> 03:29:29.100]   Okay, so I get in my car, I leave.
[03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.260]   I go to two more banks, pull out more money.
[03:29:31.260 --> 03:29:33.660]   But at one point, I go into a bank
[03:29:33.660 --> 03:29:36.860]   and like two of the cashiers practically slam
[03:29:36.860 --> 03:29:38.340]   into each other, trying to get to the phone.
[03:29:38.340 --> 03:29:39.900]   And I could tell something's up.
[03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:41.300]   Like, oh no, no, no, no, something's up.
[03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:43.020]   So I get in my car, back out.
[03:29:43.020 --> 03:29:44.380]   One of them even actually kind of runs out,
[03:29:44.380 --> 03:29:46.340]   looks, tag number, you know?
[03:29:46.340 --> 03:29:48.580]   So I drive, I get in the interstate, I go.
[03:29:48.580 --> 03:29:50.740]   You know, Becky, of course, she's, you know,
[03:29:50.740 --> 03:29:53.580]   I'm sorry, I love you.
[03:29:53.580 --> 03:29:55.500]   I would have never done, I was just scared.
[03:29:55.500 --> 03:29:56.340]   I understand.
[03:29:56.340 --> 03:29:58.380]   I go--
[03:29:58.380 --> 03:29:59.260]   - Becky sounds like a handful.
[03:29:59.260 --> 03:30:00.260]   - Oh my God, bro.
[03:30:02.100 --> 03:30:04.420]   So I go all the way back to Charlotte.
[03:30:04.420 --> 03:30:05.700]   I pack up my apartment.
[03:30:05.700 --> 03:30:08.580]   I drive all the way to Houston
[03:30:08.580 --> 03:30:10.500]   with my entire apartment packed up, by the way,
[03:30:10.500 --> 03:30:11.340]   in a U-Haul.
[03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:13.820]   Like, the next day, the next morning,
[03:30:13.820 --> 03:30:16.340]   she's got people there packing it up, movers.
[03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:18.860]   We pack it up.
[03:30:18.860 --> 03:30:21.300]   I drive the U-Haul all the way to Houston.
[03:30:21.300 --> 03:30:22.340]   Takes a couple days.
[03:30:22.340 --> 03:30:27.220]   I unload it into, we have some guys unload it
[03:30:27.220 --> 03:30:31.980]   into a storage unit 'cause I'm gonna stay
[03:30:31.980 --> 03:30:34.060]   with Becky until I find my own apartment.
[03:30:34.060 --> 03:30:36.860]   As we're driving around the neighborhood, super nice.
[03:30:36.860 --> 03:30:38.660]   She's living in like, whatever, like on like
[03:30:38.660 --> 03:30:42.420]   that 20th floor or something of some huge high rise.
[03:30:42.420 --> 03:30:43.380]   Great apartment.
[03:30:43.380 --> 03:30:46.940]   We drive by and I go, "Oh, stop the car."
[03:30:46.940 --> 03:30:48.420]   And I go, "I wanna get out."
[03:30:48.420 --> 03:30:50.980]   It's one of those cone things where there's flyers
[03:30:50.980 --> 03:30:52.740]   for the house, for a house.
[03:30:52.740 --> 03:30:54.900]   I jump out and I get the flyer.
[03:30:54.900 --> 03:30:56.780]   And she's like, "What are you doing?"
[03:30:56.780 --> 03:30:59.580]   I go, "Oh, I just wanna, you know, I just look at the flyer."
[03:30:59.580 --> 03:31:01.820]   And she says, "I don't wanna do a scam here.
[03:31:01.820 --> 03:31:02.660]   "I wanna live here.
[03:31:02.660 --> 03:31:03.500]   "This place is nice.
[03:31:03.500 --> 03:31:04.340]   "I love it here."
[03:31:04.340 --> 03:31:06.220]   And I went, "Right, I understand."
[03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:09.300]   I said, "No, but I have to find an apartment."
[03:31:09.300 --> 03:31:12.380]   And she goes, "Oh, you just, I'm just so disgusting.
[03:31:12.380 --> 03:31:15.740]   "You can't stand to spend even a couple weeks with me.
[03:31:15.740 --> 03:31:18.220]   "You just," and she goes just ballistic.
[03:31:18.220 --> 03:31:21.220]   She's screaming at the top of her lungs.
[03:31:21.220 --> 03:31:23.220]   And I know she's gonna get me caught.
[03:31:23.220 --> 03:31:26.620]   She's never gonna get me out, right?
[03:31:26.620 --> 03:31:28.540]   She's already told me that.
[03:31:28.540 --> 03:31:31.580]   So we go back to the apartment, we go upstairs.
[03:31:31.580 --> 03:31:36.140]   I was so scared of this chick, bro.
[03:31:36.140 --> 03:31:36.980]   I was so scared.
[03:31:36.980 --> 03:31:38.980]   I remember I was going up in the elevator
[03:31:38.980 --> 03:31:44.340]   and this girl gets on, this clearly a stripper.
[03:31:44.340 --> 03:31:49.340]   I mean, drop dead, just, but wearing stripper clothes.
[03:31:49.340 --> 03:31:52.580]   And I'm staring, and as soon as she got on,
[03:31:52.580 --> 03:31:54.540]   Becky gave me that, whoo, with the face.
[03:31:54.540 --> 03:31:55.500]   And I'm like this.
[03:31:55.500 --> 03:31:57.060]   I'm like staring in the corner.
[03:31:58.100 --> 03:31:59.740]   And never look at the girl.
[03:31:59.740 --> 03:32:01.060]   And I remember when we get off the elevator,
[03:32:01.060 --> 03:32:04.220]   bing, it opens, I bolt off it.
[03:32:04.220 --> 03:32:07.460]   Becky bolts off the elevator.
[03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:09.020]   And I remember she squeals,
[03:32:09.020 --> 03:32:12.420]   "I bet you just love to fuck that tramp."
[03:32:12.420 --> 03:32:14.380]   And the girl, as the elevator doors are closing,
[03:32:14.380 --> 03:32:15.620]   she goes, "Hey."
[03:32:15.620 --> 03:32:17.460]   (both laughing)
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:18.580]   I thought that was funny.
[03:32:18.580 --> 03:32:20.800]   So I go to the apartment.
[03:32:20.800 --> 03:32:25.620]   We have a screaming match, kind of.
[03:32:26.620 --> 03:32:28.660]   I tell her I wanna split up the money.
[03:32:28.660 --> 03:32:31.420]   She tells me she's not gonna give me, split the money.
[03:32:31.420 --> 03:32:32.620]   - Why?
[03:32:32.620 --> 03:32:36.020]   - Because she said, "You can go somewhere else
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:37.860]   "and do this again.
[03:32:37.860 --> 03:32:41.840]   "You'll have a million dollars in six months.
[03:32:41.840 --> 03:32:44.500]   "I have to live off this money."
[03:32:44.500 --> 03:32:45.740]   - Did she threaten you?
[03:32:45.740 --> 03:32:47.740]   - Oh, she threatened the, but it was funny too,
[03:32:47.740 --> 03:32:48.980]   'cause the conversation back and forth,
[03:32:48.980 --> 03:32:50.900]   I remember saying, "No, I want half."
[03:32:50.900 --> 03:32:54.260]   And she goes, and she said, "I'll give you $10,000."
[03:32:54.260 --> 03:32:55.580]   I said, "You're out of your mind."
[03:32:55.580 --> 03:32:56.800]   I said, "I'm telling you right now,
[03:32:56.800 --> 03:32:57.700]   "you come up with something reasonable,
[03:32:57.700 --> 03:32:59.420]   "I'll take all of it."
[03:32:59.420 --> 03:33:02.380]   And she said, what did she say?
[03:33:02.380 --> 03:33:03.220]   I said, "I'll take all of it."
[03:33:03.220 --> 03:33:04.040]   She goes, "And what?
[03:33:04.040 --> 03:33:06.740]   "Escape in that U-Haul the cops are gonna be looking for
[03:33:06.740 --> 03:33:08.240]   "in five minutes?"
[03:33:08.240 --> 03:33:10.380]   And I went, I just remember thinking, "Oh, wow."
[03:33:10.380 --> 03:33:12.580]   And keep in mind, all of my IDs, everything,
[03:33:12.580 --> 03:33:14.220]   are in the storage unit that she has a key to.
[03:33:14.220 --> 03:33:15.900]   Like, I'm not getting those, it's over.
[03:33:15.900 --> 03:33:19.740]   I got an ID right now that says my name is Michael Eckert.
[03:33:19.740 --> 03:33:23.460]   I'm driving a U-Haul van.
[03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:26.540]   - Yeah, sounds like she has a lot of negotiation leverage.
[03:33:26.540 --> 03:33:28.460]   - Right, so we start arguing back and forth,
[03:33:28.460 --> 03:33:30.420]   and she says, "$100,000.
[03:33:30.420 --> 03:33:31.260]   "I'll give you $100,000."
[03:33:31.260 --> 03:33:32.220]   I said, "I'll take it."
[03:33:32.220 --> 03:33:35.580]   She counts it out, counts out the $100,000.
[03:33:35.580 --> 03:33:37.700]   Later when I recounted, it wasn't even $100,000,
[03:33:37.700 --> 03:33:38.900]   it was like $98,000.
[03:33:38.900 --> 03:33:40.580]   That's fine, that's fine.
[03:33:40.580 --> 03:33:43.580]   But we've got them all marked, $2,000, $5,000, $6,000.
[03:33:43.580 --> 03:33:45.340]   She's like, "$2,000, $5,000, that's $12,000,
[03:33:45.340 --> 03:33:48.020]   "that's," she ends up stiffing me.
[03:33:48.020 --> 03:33:49.500]   That's fine, it's not my money.
[03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:54.500]   So I take it, I end up, I take it, I leave,
[03:33:54.500 --> 03:33:56.500]   and as I'm leaving, she'd always called me before
[03:33:56.500 --> 03:33:58.500]   on the phone and begged and pleaded and cried.
[03:33:58.500 --> 03:34:00.100]   I messed up, please give me a chance.
[03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:02.420]   I'm sorry, I'll take my medication.
[03:34:02.420 --> 03:34:03.580]   I'm sorry, I thought it was better.
[03:34:03.580 --> 03:34:04.420]   I thought it was okay.
[03:34:04.420 --> 03:34:07.100]   And I remember walking out, I put my cell phone
[03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:08.820]   on the counter and just walked out.
[03:34:08.820 --> 03:34:11.860]   Went downstairs, got in the truck and drove.
[03:34:11.860 --> 03:34:18.500]   And drove, when I got to,
[03:34:19.500 --> 03:34:23.740]   Louisiana, I stopped at Baton Rouge and got a,
[03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:26.620]   I mean, at some point I stopped and I got like,
[03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:29.180]   I think I got a room or something.
[03:34:29.180 --> 03:34:30.980]   At one point I know I stopped.
[03:34:30.980 --> 03:34:32.780]   - So you drove without a plan, essentially?
[03:34:32.780 --> 03:34:37.260]   - I drove back to Charlotte to get my car.
[03:34:37.260 --> 03:34:38.100]   - Got it.
[03:34:38.100 --> 03:34:41.220]   - So I can't be driving, I can't drive in this truck.
[03:34:41.220 --> 03:34:45.020]   So I stopped at Baton Rouge at one point
[03:34:45.020 --> 03:34:49.340]   and got a cell phone, like a burner phone,
[03:34:49.340 --> 03:34:52.820]   like a Verizon, Virgin Mobile or something.
[03:34:52.820 --> 03:34:53.660]   One of those little phones.
[03:34:53.660 --> 03:34:56.580]   So I bought one, I call a few people at home,
[03:34:56.580 --> 03:34:58.460]   back home, called my mom.
[03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:01.580]   She's in tears, crying.
[03:35:01.580 --> 03:35:03.540]   My dad's yelling in the background.
[03:35:03.540 --> 03:35:05.340]   I call--
[03:35:05.340 --> 03:35:07.500]   - What did your mom, just a small tangent,
[03:35:07.500 --> 03:35:09.340]   what did your mom and dad say?
[03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:11.460]   Did anything stand out to you?
[03:35:11.460 --> 03:35:16.060]   - My dad, "Well, I hope you're happy.
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:17.980]   "Your mother, every time someone mentions your name,
[03:35:17.980 --> 03:35:20.060]   "your mother cries."
[03:35:20.060 --> 03:35:22.380]   Which is funny to me, 'cause growing up,
[03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:24.380]   he was never concerned about her crying.
[03:35:24.380 --> 03:35:28.300]   So it was like, "Since when did you care?"
[03:35:28.300 --> 03:35:33.580]   I mean, my dad, he's an alcoholic.
[03:35:33.580 --> 03:35:36.700]   He's been sober for two years,
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:40.740]   a month and a half drunk and binge,
[03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:42.260]   or drinking, sorry, drinking binge,
[03:35:42.260 --> 03:35:44.740]   and then sober for six months, and then did it again,
[03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:46.980]   then sober, just went back and forth,
[03:35:46.980 --> 03:35:51.980]   and in and out of alcohol, drug programs.
[03:35:51.980 --> 03:35:54.180]   But like I said, worked for State Farm,
[03:35:54.180 --> 03:35:58.100]   and State Farm, he was a top-selling manager.
[03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:00.340]   And so what they would do is they'd put him
[03:36:00.340 --> 03:36:05.060]   into a 30-day program, and I mean, he has to stay there.
[03:36:05.060 --> 03:36:07.060]   And they were the only ones that had that kind of control,
[03:36:07.060 --> 03:36:08.140]   'cause they're like, "You're gonna do this,
[03:36:08.180 --> 03:36:10.420]   "and you're gonna pass it, or we're firing you."
[03:36:10.420 --> 03:36:13.900]   He made a lot of money, and he made a lot of money
[03:36:13.900 --> 03:36:18.900]   for State Farm, and he hired and trained a ton of agents,
[03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:21.980]   and he had one of the top-performing agencies.
[03:36:21.980 --> 03:36:23.500]   So he was worth a lot to them.
[03:36:23.500 --> 03:36:30.580]   So I end up, what ends up happening is,
[03:36:30.580 --> 03:36:32.460]   I'm driving through, I get that phone
[03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.100]   that I was telling you about, and I call.
[03:36:34.100 --> 03:36:37.820]   So I call, talk to my mom, she's crying,
[03:36:37.820 --> 03:36:39.220]   she's like, "I love you so much,
[03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:41.780]   "I just wanna make sure you're safe."
[03:36:41.780 --> 03:36:43.620]   I end up calling Susan Barker,
[03:36:43.620 --> 03:36:46.420]   which was one of the brokers that worked for me at the time.
[03:36:46.420 --> 03:36:48.020]   Call her, and I say, "Hey, what's going on?
[03:36:48.020 --> 03:36:48.860]   "How's it going?"
[03:36:48.860 --> 03:36:50.260]   She's like, "Oh, Matt, what's going on?
[03:36:50.260 --> 03:36:52.180]   "FBI is everywhere.
[03:36:52.180 --> 03:36:54.980]   "They've been talking to everybody, they..."
[03:36:54.980 --> 03:36:57.740]   And this has been, it's like a year and a half
[03:36:57.740 --> 03:36:59.260]   at this point.
[03:36:59.260 --> 03:37:02.820]   And she's like, "It's not, they come around
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:04.580]   "every once in a while, everybody's gone in,
[03:37:04.580 --> 03:37:06.520]   "everybody's cooperating, everybody's talking,
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:10.100]   "everybody's blaming you, including her."
[03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:12.220]   And so as we're talking, she said,
[03:37:12.220 --> 03:37:17.220]   "Look, I've, the main FBI agent on the case,
[03:37:17.220 --> 03:37:24.380]   "she told me if I ever spoke with you to have you call her."
[03:37:24.380 --> 03:37:25.900]   And I was like, "Yeah, I'm good."
[03:37:25.900 --> 03:37:27.600]   So she goes, "Her name is Candace,
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:30.460]   "and she wants you to call her."
[03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:32.140]   She goes, "At least call her, for God's sakes,
[03:37:32.140 --> 03:37:33.380]   "maybe you could just turn yourself in.
[03:37:33.380 --> 03:37:36.300]   "Maybe you can negotiate just like a couple of years,
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:38.760]   "like a, 'cause if they're not gonna catch you,
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:40.480]   "then maybe turn yourself in, maybe it'll help,
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:41.500]   "at least hear her out."
[03:37:41.500 --> 03:37:42.860]   And I was like, "Okay, all right, you're right.
[03:37:42.860 --> 03:37:44.780]   "Hang up the phone, I call Candace."
[03:37:44.780 --> 03:37:46.520]   She picks up the phone, I go, "Hey."
[03:37:46.520 --> 03:37:47.360]   I said, she goes, "Who's this?"
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:49.200]   And I go, "This is Matt Cox."
[03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:51.900]   And she goes, "Hey, hello, Mr. Cox.
[03:37:51.900 --> 03:37:52.740]   "How are you?"
[03:37:52.740 --> 03:37:54.580]   And I go, "I'm doing okay, how's it going?
[03:37:54.580 --> 03:37:55.640]   "I understand you wanna talk to me."
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:56.480]   She goes, "I do."
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:37:57.300]   I said, "What can I do for you?"
[03:37:57.300 --> 03:37:58.140]   She goes, "You can turn yourself in."
[03:37:58.140 --> 03:37:59.740]   I go, "Well, that's not gonna happen."
[03:37:59.740 --> 03:38:01.460]   I said, "What else do you need?"
[03:38:01.460 --> 03:38:03.580]   And she said, "I think that you should think
[03:38:03.580 --> 03:38:04.540]   "about turning yourself in."
[03:38:04.540 --> 03:38:05.380]   I said, "Why?
[03:38:05.380 --> 03:38:06.200]   "Well, what am I looking at?"
[03:38:06.200 --> 03:38:08.500]   She goes, "Well, that's not how it works.
[03:38:08.500 --> 03:38:10.780]   "The way it works is you turn yourself in,
[03:38:10.780 --> 03:38:13.500]   "and we take that into consideration."
[03:38:13.500 --> 03:38:14.860]   I said, "No, no, no, no."
[03:38:14.860 --> 03:38:15.820]   I said, "That's not good enough."
[03:38:15.820 --> 03:38:17.720]   I said, "I'm not stupid enough to turn myself in
[03:38:17.720 --> 03:38:18.940]   "and hope for the best."
[03:38:18.940 --> 03:38:24.940]   So she says, "Well, let's talk about this."
[03:38:24.940 --> 03:38:26.180]   And I said, "Well, what am I looking at?"
[03:38:26.180 --> 03:38:27.020]   And she goes, "I don't really know.
[03:38:27.020 --> 03:38:30.740]   "I can't really, I can't tell you that."
[03:38:30.740 --> 03:38:33.160]   And I said, "Well, then we don't really have anything
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:34.000]   "to talk about."
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:34.820]   She goes, "Well, wait a second."
[03:38:34.820 --> 03:38:35.900]   She said, "Let me, hold on.
[03:38:35.900 --> 03:38:37.020]   "Let me call the US attorney.
[03:38:37.020 --> 03:38:38.380]   "Maybe we can work something out."
[03:38:38.380 --> 03:38:42.460]   So she calls the US, so I said, "Okay, I'll call you back."
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:48.260]   And she said, "Well, give me your phone number.
[03:38:48.260 --> 03:38:49.500]   "I'll call you."
[03:38:49.500 --> 03:38:50.340]   And I went, "No, no, no."
[03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:51.380]   I said, "I'll call you."
[03:38:51.380 --> 03:38:52.260]   I said, "I'm gonna hang up the phone.
[03:38:52.260 --> 03:38:53.380]   "I'm gonna turn the phone off."
[03:38:53.380 --> 03:38:55.120]   I said, "For all I know, you're triangulating
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:38:57.220]   "this phone call right now or something."
[03:38:57.220 --> 03:38:58.860]   And she goes, "Oh, give me a break."
[03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:00.940]   She goes, "You're not that important."
[03:39:00.940 --> 03:39:05.180]   And I remember thinking, "Who do you think you are?"
[03:39:05.180 --> 03:39:09.700]   Like, right, you're just some little fraudster guy
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:10.980]   running around, you know?
[03:39:10.980 --> 03:39:14.260]   Like, you're not a terrorist, you know?
[03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:19.260]   And I almost, I almost was like, "Okay, here's my number."
[03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:23.260]   Which she probably already had.
[03:39:23.260 --> 03:39:25.920]   But I almost was like, "Okay, I'll wait for your call."
[03:39:25.920 --> 03:39:26.760]   And left my phone on.
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:27.580]   I said, "No, you know what?"
[03:39:27.580 --> 03:39:28.420]   I said, "I'm gonna hang up the phone.
[03:39:28.420 --> 03:39:30.660]   "I'm gonna turn it off anyway and I'll call you back."
[03:39:30.660 --> 03:39:31.580]   She's, "All right, whatever."
[03:39:31.580 --> 03:39:32.660]   I hang up.
[03:39:32.660 --> 03:39:33.860]   I turn off the phone.
[03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:35.100]   It turns out, I found out later
[03:39:35.100 --> 03:39:37.060]   when I ordered the Freedom of Information Act,
[03:39:37.060 --> 03:39:39.020]   she actually immediately called the U.S. Marshals
[03:39:39.020 --> 03:39:41.100]   and they immediately called, took the phone number
[03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:44.500]   and tracked back the phone and immediately had two marshals
[03:39:44.500 --> 03:39:48.780]   from Baton Rouge go immediately to the place
[03:39:48.780 --> 03:39:49.980]   where I had been.
[03:39:49.980 --> 03:39:53.140]   - Damn. - Oh, listen.
[03:39:53.140 --> 03:39:54.660]   Yeah, I mean-- - They work fast.
[03:39:54.660 --> 03:39:56.540]   - Yeah, she's-- - And she's good, too.
[03:39:56.540 --> 03:39:57.380]   - Not just that.
[03:39:57.380 --> 03:40:00.220]   I made the initial calls sitting there
[03:40:00.220 --> 03:40:02.740]   in that where I went and bought the phone.
[03:40:02.740 --> 03:40:03.820]   It was like a gas station.
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:05.700]   There was also like a subway station.
[03:40:05.700 --> 03:40:06.860]   I had ordered like a subway.
[03:40:06.860 --> 03:40:09.100]   I was eating a subway, playing on my computer,
[03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:11.220]   programmed the phone and making phone calls.
[03:40:11.220 --> 03:40:15.940]   So by the time I talked to her and they're driving,
[03:40:15.940 --> 03:40:18.860]   by that point, I walked and got into my vehicle
[03:40:18.860 --> 03:40:20.060]   and I leave.
[03:40:20.060 --> 03:40:20.900]   But who knows?
[03:40:20.900 --> 03:40:22.260]   I don't know if they showed up 30 minutes late.
[03:40:22.260 --> 03:40:23.100]   I don't know.
[03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:24.260]   I could have hung out.
[03:40:24.260 --> 03:40:26.100]   Like, "Oh, I'm just gonna finish my food."
[03:40:26.100 --> 03:40:27.100]   Could have shown up.
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:31.740]   So I go, I call her back an hour or two later.
[03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:32.780]   She says, "Listen."
[03:40:32.780 --> 03:40:37.100]   First time, he hadn't got back with her.
[03:40:37.100 --> 03:40:38.060]   Then he did.
[03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:38.900]   Then he came back.
[03:40:38.900 --> 03:40:39.720]   He said, "Seven years.
[03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:41.740]   "He's gotta turn himself in here."
[03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:45.740]   So okay, seven years, that seems like a lot.
[03:40:45.740 --> 03:40:46.580]   And I was like, "Seven years."
[03:40:46.580 --> 03:40:51.460]   And I kept saying, "Is that seven years for everything?"
[03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:53.860]   And she goes, "Yeah, that's for everything."
[03:40:53.860 --> 03:40:54.980]   I was like, "That's everything?"
[03:40:54.980 --> 03:40:58.860]   Like everything that happened like in Atlanta,
[03:40:58.860 --> 03:41:00.900]   like some stuff that you don't know about.
[03:41:00.900 --> 03:41:01.960]   She said, "Look, what's important
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:04.700]   "is you turn yourself in in Tampa."
[03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:07.420]   And I was like, "Okay, well, I'm closer to Atlanta.
[03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:10.440]   "Why wouldn't I turn myself in in Atlanta?"
[03:41:10.440 --> 03:41:13.180]   And she's like, "Look, you don't wanna do that.
[03:41:13.180 --> 03:41:14.020]   "You don't wanna do that."
[03:41:14.020 --> 03:41:15.340]   Well, 'cause that would have been the Secret Service
[03:41:15.340 --> 03:41:18.100]   would have gotten credit if I'd walked in there, right?
[03:41:18.100 --> 03:41:21.580]   So, and I don't know anything about rivalries
[03:41:21.580 --> 03:41:22.420]   and how they work.
[03:41:22.420 --> 03:41:24.420]   At that time, I do now.
[03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:26.780]   But so, we go back and forth, back and forth.
[03:41:26.780 --> 03:41:27.900]   And I continually ask her,
[03:41:27.900 --> 03:41:30.060]   "Does that include Atlanta and everything?"
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:31.300]   And at some point, I realized like,
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:33.180]   "Oh, she's just not answering."
[03:41:33.180 --> 03:41:34.980]   And so finally, I said,
[03:41:34.980 --> 03:41:37.520]   "Listen, you keep dodging this question."
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:42.960]   And she said, "All I can speak for is Tampa.
[03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:44.860]   "So if you come back to Tampa
[03:41:44.860 --> 03:41:49.940]   "and you cooperate against everyone, seven years."
[03:41:49.940 --> 03:41:52.780]   And she's telling me,
[03:41:52.780 --> 03:41:55.320]   she wants me to cooperate against my ex-wife.
[03:41:55.320 --> 03:41:57.080]   And I'm like, "I'm not gonna do that."
[03:41:57.080 --> 03:41:59.100]   I said, "My ex-wife didn't do anything.
[03:41:59.100 --> 03:42:00.480]   "She doesn't know anything.
[03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:01.360]   "She didn't do anything.
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:03.800]   "She's never, you know, well, that's not what I heard."
[03:42:03.800 --> 03:42:05.700]   And then she's going on and on.
[03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:07.380]   And I was like, "No, no."
[03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:08.220]   I was like, "Oh, wow."
[03:42:08.220 --> 03:42:09.860]   I was like, "So that's just for?"
[03:42:09.860 --> 03:42:10.740]   And she's like, "That's right."
[03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:11.860]   I said, "All right, we're done."
[03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:15.420]   She's, "No, wait, I can call the Atlanta U.S. Attorney."
[03:42:15.420 --> 03:42:16.720]   I said, "Nah, lady, I wouldn't believe you
[03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:18.440]   "if you told me water was wet.
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:19.340]   "I don't trust you."
[03:42:19.340 --> 03:42:21.980]   And I hung up the phone, threw it out the window.
[03:42:21.980 --> 03:42:25.460]   And I end up going to Charlotte,
[03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:29.460]   drop off the U-Haul van,
[03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:33.540]   go to my, I never did,
[03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:35.260]   I actually brought it back to the dealer.
[03:42:35.260 --> 03:42:38.480]   Like, it's not like I abandoned it, I brought it back.
[03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:40.500]   So I bring it back.
[03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:43.320]   I go to my old apartment in downtown Charlotte.
[03:42:43.320 --> 03:42:46.340]   And I remember thinking I would be okay.
[03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:51.340]   I know by this point that they knew Michael Eckert's name.
[03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:55.660]   They had the address in Charlotte.
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:42:59.140]   So I know they, by this point, it's been five, six days.
[03:42:59.140 --> 03:43:01.360]   So I know they've tracked him back there.
[03:43:01.360 --> 03:43:05.340]   So I figured if I could get my car, I'm fine.
[03:43:05.340 --> 03:43:06.900]   So I go into the apartment complex,
[03:43:06.900 --> 03:43:07.900]   and it's like five,
[03:43:07.900 --> 03:43:11.180]   it's one of those four, five, six-story apartment.
[03:43:11.180 --> 03:43:14.480]   Those are parking things that stack up.
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:16.780]   So I go into this underground,
[03:43:16.780 --> 03:43:17.860]   it's not underground, but whatever,
[03:43:17.860 --> 03:43:19.380]   this parking garage thing.
[03:43:19.380 --> 03:43:21.380]   So I go in, I'm on like the third floor or something.
[03:43:21.380 --> 03:43:25.060]   I look at my car, and I get in my car.
[03:43:25.060 --> 03:43:27.620]   And I remember as soon as I drove out of the parking garage,
[03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:29.980]   I was like, whew, I'm good.
[03:43:29.980 --> 03:43:32.020]   So I can go ahead and pull across the street
[03:43:32.020 --> 03:43:33.820]   and stop at Starbucks.
[03:43:33.820 --> 03:43:35.620]   So I stop at Starbucks.
[03:43:35.620 --> 03:43:38.140]   I walk into Starbucks, I order a Starbucks.
[03:43:38.140 --> 03:43:39.940]   I'm standing there waiting for the barista.
[03:43:39.940 --> 03:43:42.380]   I look over, and it's two people
[03:43:42.380 --> 03:43:45.640]   from the apartment complex, staring at me.
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:49.040]   Like that's what I'm like,
[03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:51.160]   and they're whispering and pointing.
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:53.880]   And I remember thinking this is like the fifth of the month.
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:56.120]   I hadn't paid my rent, hadn't been there.
[03:43:56.120 --> 03:43:58.380]   So I thought-- - That makes sense.
[03:43:58.380 --> 03:44:01.080]   - Maybe they, like I'm picturing an eviction notice
[03:44:01.080 --> 03:44:03.380]   or a three-day notice on my door or something.
[03:44:03.380 --> 03:44:04.560]   And I'm like, okay.
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:07.260]   And then one of them bolts out the back, the woman,
[03:44:07.260 --> 03:44:08.120]   there's a guy and a girl.
[03:44:08.120 --> 03:44:09.880]   The woman runs out the back.
[03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:11.380]   He's standing there staring at me.
[03:44:11.380 --> 03:44:16.380]   I get my venti vanilla latte, right?
[03:44:16.380 --> 03:44:19.660]   I get my little, I get my frou-frou drink.
[03:44:19.660 --> 03:44:21.120]   So I got my frou-frou drink.
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:23.040]   I walk out, I get into the car.
[03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:24.760]   He follows me.
[03:44:24.760 --> 03:44:26.400]   Get in the car, I set everything up.
[03:44:26.400 --> 03:44:27.920]   I put my seatbelt on, I'm okay.
[03:44:27.920 --> 03:44:30.120]   He's standing there staring at me.
[03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:32.640]   I'm thinking something's wrong, like what's up?
[03:44:32.640 --> 03:44:36.340]   And I check to see there's no traffic, I'm good.
[03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:39.880]   I'm about to leave, and he starts screaming.
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:41.900]   He's right here, he's right here.
[03:44:41.900 --> 03:44:43.420]   I look in the rear view mirror.
[03:44:43.420 --> 03:44:46.620]   There's two guys running towards the back of my car.
[03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:49.120]   I punch it and I take off.
[03:44:49.120 --> 03:44:51.900]   Sounds dramatic, wasn't that dramatic.
[03:44:51.900 --> 03:44:53.140]   I'd already, there was no cars.
[03:44:53.140 --> 03:44:55.240]   I knew there was no cars already pulling out.
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:56.660]   You know, it wasn't like a TJ hooker
[03:44:56.660 --> 03:45:00.300]   where I jumped over the, slid across the hood and slung,
[03:45:00.300 --> 03:45:03.020]   you know, they didn't catch the car and hang on the back.
[03:45:03.020 --> 03:45:06.620]   But you know, so they're running and I boom, hit it.
[03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:08.100]   - Did you spill the coffee or?
[03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:09.340]   - No, 'cause it was one of those little things.
[03:45:09.340 --> 03:45:10.740]   It was actually nice, but it just sounded--
[03:45:10.740 --> 03:45:12.600]   - You're making it sound like you were pretty calm.
[03:45:12.600 --> 03:45:13.440]   Weren't you panicking here?
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:16.300]   - I was terrified, terrified.
[03:45:16.300 --> 03:45:21.180]   - So you're under fear, you still operate like--
[03:45:21.180 --> 03:45:22.980]   - Yeah, I operate, like I-- - Calmly.
[03:45:22.980 --> 03:45:27.940]   - It's funny you say that because the secret service,
[03:45:27.940 --> 03:45:29.520]   when they talk to these guys,
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:32.620]   they, all the people that they spoke with
[03:45:32.620 --> 03:45:35.140]   said the same thing over and over again.
[03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:36.300]   The guy was a professional.
[03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:40.460]   He never seemed upset, he never seemed agitated.
[03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:43.480]   He always, he was never in a hurry.
[03:45:43.480 --> 03:45:44.320]   - Yeah.
[03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:48.580]   - He, you know, like, but most of the time I wasn't
[03:45:48.580 --> 03:45:50.220]   because I, you know, it wasn't until the police
[03:45:50.220 --> 03:45:53.220]   got involved or the federal law enforcement got involved
[03:45:53.220 --> 03:45:57.100]   that I started really, you know, getting anxious.
[03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:00.480]   So at that point, I drive, I take off.
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:02.260]   I drive about a mile down the road.
[03:46:02.260 --> 03:46:04.260]   - Who were the two guys, by the way?
[03:46:04.260 --> 03:46:05.420]   - I thought it was FBI.
[03:46:05.420 --> 03:46:07.060]   I ordered the Freedom of Information Act
[03:46:07.060 --> 03:46:10.180]   when I got to prison at some point, you know, in the future.
[03:46:10.180 --> 03:46:14.540]   And it was U.S. Marshals, all right, so--
[03:46:14.540 --> 03:46:15.780]   - Sounds pretty dramatic to me.
[03:46:15.780 --> 03:46:18.300]   U.S. Marshals running towards your car, you pull, I mean.
[03:46:18.300 --> 03:46:20.340]   - I mean-- - You know, but it's all right.
[03:46:20.340 --> 03:46:22.260]   - It's hard not to tell it like it's dramatic.
[03:46:22.260 --> 03:46:23.220]   - I understand.
[03:46:23.220 --> 03:46:25.140]   But it was, there's not much traffic, it was okay.
[03:46:25.140 --> 03:46:26.740]   - Yeah, it's not like their, you know,
[03:46:26.740 --> 03:46:28.620]   their fingers were at the back of the car,
[03:46:28.620 --> 03:46:29.780]   they're holding on, you know.
[03:46:29.780 --> 03:46:32.900]   But it was, yeah, if I had waited an extra 20 seconds,
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:34.020]   yeah, they would've been on my car.
[03:46:34.020 --> 03:46:34.860]   They would've been right there at the door.
[03:46:34.860 --> 03:46:37.860]   - Did you consider giving up there, or no?
[03:46:37.860 --> 03:46:41.580]   - No, all I could think of was haul,
[03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:44.540]   listen, my instinct is get out, is go, go, go, go, go, go.
[03:46:44.540 --> 03:46:45.820]   - You're already on the run.
[03:46:45.820 --> 03:46:47.060]   - I'm already in trouble.
[03:46:47.060 --> 03:46:49.740]   It's not like they're gonna add anything.
[03:46:49.740 --> 03:46:52.460]   Although, to be honest, you know, it only got worse
[03:46:52.460 --> 03:46:54.260]   because at that point, actually, at that point,
[03:46:54.260 --> 03:46:56.500]   I drive down the road, I stop at a homeless facility,
[03:46:56.500 --> 03:46:58.100]   I survey three guys.
[03:46:58.100 --> 03:46:59.540]   I'm a mile down the road.
[03:46:59.540 --> 03:47:02.700]   Like, looking back on it, I think, what were you thinking?
[03:47:02.700 --> 03:47:05.860]   But there were three homeless guys
[03:47:05.860 --> 03:47:07.740]   that were in their early 30s,
[03:47:07.740 --> 03:47:09.380]   and they were all Caucasian.
[03:47:09.380 --> 03:47:10.660]   That's hard to find.
[03:47:10.660 --> 03:47:13.300]   So trust me, I've looked, spent hours
[03:47:13.300 --> 03:47:15.060]   before finding these guys.
[03:47:15.060 --> 03:47:18.340]   - So that's like the golden thing you're looking for
[03:47:18.340 --> 03:47:20.420]   is white guys in their 30s.
[03:47:20.420 --> 03:47:22.220]   - Right, 'cause I was in my 30s,
[03:47:22.220 --> 03:47:23.900]   I wasn't an old man like I am now.
[03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:28.900]   So I survey them, I drive straight to Nashville,
[03:47:28.900 --> 03:47:32.060]   get to Nashville, drive through an area
[03:47:32.060 --> 03:47:33.460]   called Greenhills.
[03:47:33.460 --> 03:47:38.740]   Well, at first, when I got to Nashville,
[03:47:38.740 --> 03:47:40.780]   I stayed the night, and the next day,
[03:47:40.780 --> 03:47:44.060]   I went into, I'm gonna say a UPS store.
[03:47:44.060 --> 03:47:45.140]   It was actually a Kinko's.
[03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:47.620]   There used to be, they used to be called Kinko's, but--
[03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:49.220]   - I can't remember Kinko's.
[03:47:49.220 --> 03:47:52.500]   They got bought by FedEx, I feel like.
[03:47:52.500 --> 03:47:53.940]   - Oh, was it FedEx, okay.
[03:47:53.940 --> 03:47:54.780]   Then it was a FedEx store.
[03:47:54.780 --> 03:47:56.340]   So I go in there-- - I love Kinko's.
[03:47:56.340 --> 03:47:58.220]   - And you give 'em like 50 bucks or something,
[03:47:58.220 --> 03:47:59.180]   or 20 bucks or something,
[03:47:59.180 --> 03:48:01.140]   they'd give you like 100 business cards.
[03:48:01.140 --> 03:48:05.200]   So I go get a phone number, a burner phone.
[03:48:05.200 --> 03:48:08.460]   I go in there, I make up, oh, I call and get a phone number
[03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:10.460]   from HQ, the local HQ.
[03:48:10.460 --> 03:48:13.500]   I come up with a name, Manufactured Funding Group.
[03:48:13.500 --> 03:48:14.740]   I've got two phone numbers.
[03:48:14.740 --> 03:48:17.580]   I get business cards made with a name.
[03:48:17.580 --> 03:48:19.680]   One of the guys' name that I surveyed was,
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:24.940]   his actual name was Joseph Marion Carter Jr.
[03:48:24.940 --> 03:48:25.840]   I went by Carter.
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:28.380]   So I get business cards made of Joseph Carter.
[03:48:29.940 --> 03:48:32.380]   I then drive through Greenhills.
[03:48:32.380 --> 03:48:34.380]   Took 'em like an hour to get the card.
[03:48:34.380 --> 03:48:35.940]   So I'm driving through Greenhills.
[03:48:35.940 --> 03:48:37.820]   I'm planning on going to an apartment,
[03:48:37.820 --> 03:48:39.900]   but I'm still, I don't have an ID, I don't have anything.
[03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:41.340]   Like I'm wondering, what am I gonna do?
[03:48:41.340 --> 03:48:42.520]   How am I gonna get a place to stay?
[03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:44.500]   I'm gonna stay in a hotel, like what am I doing?
[03:48:44.500 --> 03:48:47.460]   I'm using an ID that the cops are looking for.
[03:48:47.460 --> 03:48:50.700]   So as I'm driving,
[03:48:50.700 --> 03:48:52.660]   trying to find this big apartment complex,
[03:48:52.660 --> 03:48:55.100]   there's a guy putting a sign in the front yard
[03:48:55.100 --> 03:48:58.540]   of like a townhouse, 'cause several townhouses.
[03:48:58.540 --> 03:49:00.260]   And I, probably in his 60s,
[03:49:00.260 --> 03:49:02.820]   I pull in, jump out of the car, and I said,
[03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:04.020]   "Hey, is that this for rent?"
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:05.820]   He said, "Yes, it is."
[03:49:05.820 --> 03:49:07.980]   I said, "Oh, okay, yeah, can I see it?"
[03:49:07.980 --> 03:49:08.820]   "Sure."
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:12.420]   I go in, check it out, come back downstairs.
[03:49:12.420 --> 03:49:13.460]   It's perfect.
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:16.700]   I said, "Listen, I work for a company,
[03:49:16.700 --> 03:49:17.740]   "manufactured funding group."
[03:49:17.740 --> 03:49:18.580]   Boom, hand him the thing.
[03:49:18.580 --> 03:49:22.660]   I said, "I've been in Europe for the last,"
[03:49:22.660 --> 03:49:23.500]   and I forget what I said.
[03:49:23.500 --> 03:49:24.320]   I said, "England."
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:26.020]   I said, "A little town outside of London."
[03:49:26.020 --> 03:49:29.060]   Then, whatever, Dexter, London for the past five years.
[03:49:29.060 --> 03:49:30.620]   I don't really have any credit,
[03:49:30.620 --> 03:49:33.160]   but I said, "I can put down double the security deposit
[03:49:33.160 --> 03:49:34.000]   "or whatever you need.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:35.100]   "Here's my business card."
[03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:38.520]   He looked at me, and he looked at my car,
[03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:43.100]   and he goes, "You look like an honest young man."
[03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:48.100]   He said, "I'll take the first month's rent and deposit."
[03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:51.540]   And he said, "Now, go get a lease right now."
[03:49:51.540 --> 03:49:52.380]   And I said, "Okay."
[03:49:52.380 --> 03:49:53.780]   And I said, "Oh, okay."
[03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:55.660]   Filled out a lease right then,
[03:49:55.660 --> 03:49:56.700]   gave me the keys.
[03:49:56.700 --> 03:50:02.860]   Nice, very trusting in that town.
[03:50:02.860 --> 03:50:04.060]   - Oh, yeah, but there must have been
[03:50:04.060 --> 03:50:06.420]   also something about you where you're just--
[03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:07.340]   - I mean, I don't--
[03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:09.080]   - Got a nice car.
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:10.540]   - I know you're gonna get a lot of comments
[03:50:10.540 --> 03:50:13.360]   that say, "White privilege," but I--
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:14.200]   (laughing)
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:15.020]   That's what you're--
[03:50:15.020 --> 03:50:18.060]   - I think the charisma has something to do with it.
[03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:20.460]   - Well, so he gave, I appreciate that.
[03:50:20.460 --> 03:50:21.700]   So, he gave me the keys.
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:27.960]   Listen, I ordered all of Joseph Carter's vital information,
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:32.880]   like all of his birth certificate,
[03:50:32.880 --> 03:50:36.580]   social security card, everything, that night,
[03:50:36.580 --> 03:50:39.800]   from Kinko's or some of the, I forget where,
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:41.040]   but from one of these places.
[03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:41.900]   I went online.
[03:50:41.900 --> 03:50:43.280]   You could go online back then.
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:44.680]   There wasn't Wi-Fi everywhere.
[03:50:44.680 --> 03:50:46.680]   So I ordered the stuff.
[03:50:46.680 --> 03:50:48.720]   It shows up a couple days later.
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:50.080]   I take that information.
[03:50:50.920 --> 03:50:53.300]   I go and I get a driver's license.
[03:50:53.300 --> 03:50:56.120]   Remember within seven or eight days,
[03:50:56.120 --> 03:50:58.280]   I've got a driver's license in his name.
[03:50:58.280 --> 03:51:01.440]   I get in that car, Michael Eckert's car.
[03:51:01.440 --> 03:51:03.020]   I drive it all the way back to Nashville.
[03:51:03.020 --> 03:51:04.960]   I leave it in long-term parking.
[03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:07.020]   Get on a plane, fly back to Nashville.
[03:51:07.020 --> 03:51:10.680]   Go in and buy myself a brand new car.
[03:51:10.680 --> 03:51:12.280]   Wasn't brand new, it was a couple years old.
[03:51:12.280 --> 03:51:16.000]   But from CarMax, within two weeks,
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:18.100]   I am completely 100% set up.
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:21.200]   I start dating for three, four months.
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:22.460]   That gets really boring.
[03:51:22.460 --> 03:51:25.240]   - Where again?
[03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:26.060]   Nashville, you said?
[03:51:26.060 --> 03:51:26.900]   - Nashville. - Okay, got it.
[03:51:26.900 --> 03:51:28.800]   - So I start dating a bunch of chicks.
[03:51:28.800 --> 03:51:30.280]   And then I end up meeting this one girl.
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:31.560]   - By the way, are you lonely here
[03:51:31.560 --> 03:51:32.760]   'cause you're on the run?
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:34.360]   - Man, listen, I'm telling you right now,
[03:51:34.360 --> 03:51:38.140]   being on the run was the best part of my life.
[03:51:38.140 --> 03:51:38.980]   - Really?
[03:51:38.980 --> 03:51:41.160]   - Everybody, you know how all these guys say,
[03:51:41.160 --> 03:51:43.880]   it was horrible, and I was always so concerned
[03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:47.280]   and looking over my shoulder, and it wasn't, I wasn't.
[03:51:47.280 --> 03:51:50.940]   Keep in mind, I've gotten five or six traffic tickets
[03:51:50.940 --> 03:51:51.960]   while on the run.
[03:51:51.960 --> 03:51:54.340]   I went to traffic school as someone else.
[03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:56.220]   I got so many traffic tickets in his name,
[03:51:56.220 --> 03:51:58.300]   I went to traffic school as him.
[03:51:58.300 --> 03:52:00.640]   Like if I got pulled over, I'm not concerned.
[03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:03.880]   - So your confidence just was over the top here.
[03:52:03.880 --> 03:52:06.640]   - Driving a vehicle in the name of the driver's license
[03:52:06.640 --> 03:52:09.440]   that I have that was issued by that state,
[03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:12.240]   full coverage insurance, I'm not an idiot.
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:14.040]   I'm not driving around a stolen car
[03:52:14.040 --> 03:52:16.920]   with a broken taillight and a body in the trunk.
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:19.820]   I'm covered, like I'm not concerned about the local cops.
[03:52:19.820 --> 03:52:23.720]   - Plus you're going to Starbucks, sipping your coffee
[03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:25.840]   and driving away from a U.S. Marshal.
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:27.160]   - Right, right, that was--
[03:52:27.160 --> 03:52:30.000]   - You could start believing that it's impossible to catch you.
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:31.320]   - That is exactly what it is.
[03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:34.400]   It's every time, I just kept getting more and more emboldened,
[03:52:34.400 --> 03:52:36.720]   more and more cocky, arrogant,
[03:52:36.720 --> 03:52:39.180]   like they're not gonna catch me, I'm too good.
[03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:41.880]   You know, which is great until they catch you.
[03:52:41.880 --> 03:52:46.880]   And so I meet a girl named Amanda Gardner,
[03:52:47.120 --> 03:52:49.560]   well, what I end up doing is,
[03:52:49.560 --> 03:52:52.000]   keep in mind, I've only got 100,000 or so.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:56.600]   So I go and I start buying houses in the area,
[03:52:56.600 --> 03:52:58.360]   in this area called JC Napier,
[03:52:58.360 --> 03:53:01.120]   next to, it's just close to downtown.
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:03.240]   And I buy these houses and I start,
[03:53:03.240 --> 03:53:05.360]   I buy 'em for like 60, 70,000
[03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:09.360]   and I record the sales at 210, 190,
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:11.200]   2205, that sort of thing.
[03:53:11.200 --> 03:53:13.360]   Same thing, and I refinance the house
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:14.800]   as I start pulling out money.
[03:53:16.040 --> 03:53:18.880]   I meet this girl, Amanda Gardner,
[03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:21.040]   she, we hit it off within a few months,
[03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:24.160]   she's moved in to, we move into a house in that area.
[03:53:24.160 --> 03:53:26.820]   I renovate a house, we move in there.
[03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:30.500]   I borrow three and a half million dollars
[03:53:30.500 --> 03:53:31.720]   and I'm buying houses now.
[03:53:31.720 --> 03:53:33.280]   I'm buying houses, recording the value.
[03:53:33.280 --> 03:53:35.400]   I start all over, you know, I borrow like,
[03:53:35.400 --> 03:53:37.080]   whatever, three and a half million dollars.
[03:53:37.080 --> 03:53:39.740]   I meet Amanda, we move in together.
[03:53:39.740 --> 03:53:42.160]   We're buying--
[03:53:42.160 --> 03:53:43.160]   - Do you tell her?
[03:53:43.160 --> 03:53:44.000]   Do you tell her about--
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:45.960]   - She kind of, you know, what she knew was that,
[03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:48.600]   you know, it's odd, right?
[03:53:48.600 --> 03:53:50.040]   I have no photographs.
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:52.040]   Everything I own is brand new.
[03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:56.240]   She's like, you don't, there's nothing in this house
[03:53:56.240 --> 03:53:59.040]   that's more than four months old, or six months old.
[03:53:59.040 --> 03:54:00.480]   You have no photographs.
[03:54:00.480 --> 03:54:02.320]   You have no internet presence.
[03:54:02.320 --> 03:54:04.100]   You have no, you know, it's,
[03:54:04.100 --> 03:54:06.680]   every stick of clothing is brand new.
[03:54:06.680 --> 03:54:08.680]   You don't have old pairs of jeans.
[03:54:08.680 --> 03:54:11.080]   - Do you tell her stories about the past of anything?
[03:54:11.080 --> 03:54:12.960]   Is there a fabricated--
[03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:15.360]   - Initially, there was a fabricated version
[03:54:15.360 --> 03:54:17.500]   that I owned a mortgage company.
[03:54:17.500 --> 03:54:21.540]   My typical story was, like, I owned a mortgage company
[03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:24.200]   and I got bought out by a household bank.
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:25.580]   Started doing very well.
[03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:27.160]   I got bought out by a household bank.
[03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:29.160]   I have a non-compete clause.
[03:54:29.160 --> 03:54:31.760]   I got, you know, I ended up with like half a million dollars
[03:54:31.760 --> 03:54:34.080]   after paying off all my bills,
[03:54:34.080 --> 03:54:36.560]   and just decided to kind of travel around the US,
[03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:39.720]   and now I'm here and I'm gonna start renovating houses.
[03:54:39.720 --> 03:54:43.000]   But that, you know, you don't call home.
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:44.280]   Nobody calls you.
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:45.420]   Your family doesn't call you.
[03:54:45.420 --> 03:54:47.620]   You tell stories about your mom, your dad,
[03:54:47.620 --> 03:54:49.680]   your brother, your sister, friends.
[03:54:49.680 --> 03:54:50.720]   I don't know any of these friends.
[03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:51.800]   Never seen any of these friends.
[03:54:51.800 --> 03:54:52.880]   They never call you.
[03:54:52.880 --> 03:54:55.680]   They never, you know, it's just like, it's like, ah, shit.
[03:54:55.680 --> 03:54:58.480]   So at some point, I basically just said to her, look,
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:04.760]   I'm, listen, at one point, I had to have a check cut.
[03:55:04.760 --> 03:55:06.200]   I refinanced the house, right?
[03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:08.520]   And I had, like, I wanna say,
[03:55:08.520 --> 03:55:10.480]   I'm gonna say something like, it might've been 30,000,
[03:55:10.480 --> 03:55:11.320]   but let's say 20,000.
[03:55:11.320 --> 03:55:15.080]   And I had a $20,000 check cut to Amanda Gardner.
[03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:16.080]   'Cause you have to have these checks.
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:17.520]   You can't have 'em cut to me.
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:19.960]   So I would say, hey, there's a second mortgage on there,
[03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:21.200]   and I'd provide a second mortgage,
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:22.720]   or I'd provide, you know, I'd provide different things.
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:27.160]   And I knew, I need names of people to cut these things to.
[03:55:27.160 --> 03:55:29.520]   So I had a check cut for whatever.
[03:55:29.520 --> 03:55:30.920]   So I remember we're at dinner one night.
[03:55:30.920 --> 03:55:32.600]   This is before she really knows who I am.
[03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:34.800]   And I said, hey, I said, oh, and she goes,
[03:55:34.800 --> 03:55:35.760]   oh, did you have to refinance?
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:36.640]   She goes, how'd that thing go?
[03:55:36.640 --> 03:55:37.480]   You were refinancing?
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:39.080]   I go, oh, thank God you said that.
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:41.680]   Boom, I said, I need you to deposit this.
[03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:42.720]   Give her a check for 20,000.
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:47.720]   She's like, I can go tomorrow, and I can deposit it.
[03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:52.240]   And I'm like, no, no, I'm like, look, it's fine,
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:53.080]   just deposit it.
[03:55:53.080 --> 03:55:54.040]   She's like, I can get, as soon as it clears,
[03:55:54.040 --> 03:55:56.160]   I'll get you a cashier's check.
[03:55:56.160 --> 03:55:59.360]   I was like, no, just deposit it and keep it in your bank.
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:01.040]   It's fine.
[03:56:01.040 --> 03:56:04.160]   So she's like, what is going on?
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:06.840]   You know, and so we have this conversation,
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:11.200]   and I tell her, look, people are looking for me.
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:12.040]   Who?
[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:12.860]   Law enforcement.
[03:56:12.860 --> 03:56:13.700]   Which ones?
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:14.560]   All of 'em.
[03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:17.700]   You know, she's like, that doesn't even, for what?
[03:56:17.700 --> 03:56:22.580]   I go, mostly bank fraud.
[03:56:22.580 --> 03:56:26.600]   And she's like, well, how are they not finding you?
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:29.000]   I mean, everybody, you know, people know you.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:30.880]   Like, you know, your general contractor,
[03:56:30.880 --> 03:56:32.640]   which I met four months before.
[03:56:32.640 --> 03:56:34.840]   This guy six months before, this one two months before.
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:36.880]   You know, she's like, so-and-so, so-and-so, so,
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:38.560]   and I'm like, right, right, well.
[03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:41.000]   I said, well, she's like, I mean, they've got your name.
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:43.440]   They've got your, I go, well, that's identity theft.
[03:56:43.440 --> 03:56:45.600]   And she was like, what do you mean?
[03:56:45.600 --> 03:56:48.160]   I said, well, my name's not, you know, my name's not,
[03:56:48.160 --> 03:56:49.440]   it's not Joseph Carter.
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:51.960]   And what is your name?
[03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:55.720]   I go, look, you know, it's, you don't even worry about it.
[03:56:55.720 --> 03:56:57.840]   This is what's happening.
[03:56:57.840 --> 03:56:58.680]   This is where I'm at.
[03:56:58.680 --> 03:56:59.960]   And this has been months into the relationship.
[03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:03.040]   I mean, this is, I'd say maybe a month or two in.
[03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:06.120]   But, you know, she was just too inquisitive.
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:07.200]   And, oh, I know what it was.
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:12.200]   She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night.
[03:57:12.200 --> 03:57:15.120]   That was another thing that happened.
[03:57:15.120 --> 03:57:19.480]   She went to get a Popsicle and she opened up the flip
[03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:22.320]   to get a Popsicle and she opened the wrong one
[03:57:22.320 --> 03:57:24.760]   and it was all cash.
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:26.880]   And she was like, like, you know, I, the other day,
[03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:28.440]   you know, in this conversation, the other day,
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:30.760]   I opened up the Popsicle box and there's cash.
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:33.440]   And I'm like, so I kind of explain it,
[03:57:33.440 --> 03:57:35.720]   but I had a feeling she's not gonna,
[03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:37.800]   she's gonna be okay with this, you know?
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:38.640]   - So she was okay.
[03:57:38.640 --> 03:57:39.720]   - She was okay with it.
[03:57:39.720 --> 03:57:42.160]   - I mean, to me, that's just a fascinating conversation
[03:57:42.160 --> 03:57:43.400]   to have, like.
[03:57:43.400 --> 03:57:44.960]   - It was a great conversation.
[03:57:44.960 --> 03:57:46.640]   - 'Cause oftentimes in relationships,
[03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:49.040]   you learn about each other and you find out new things
[03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:49.880]   and here you find out.
[03:57:49.880 --> 03:57:50.840]   - That's a doozy.
[03:57:50.840 --> 03:57:52.640]   - Yeah, it's a good one to find out.
[03:57:52.640 --> 03:57:57.800]   The name you're using is not your real name.
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:58:00.280]   And the Secret Service, the FBI,
[03:58:00.280 --> 03:58:02.500]   and everybody else are looking for you.
[03:58:02.500 --> 03:58:03.340]   - Yeah.
[03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:04.640]   - And you're, like, to be honest,
[03:58:04.640 --> 03:58:06.560]   you're not a violent criminal.
[03:58:06.560 --> 03:58:08.780]   So it's like, you know.
[03:58:08.780 --> 03:58:10.280]   - But she didn't know my name.
[03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:13.960]   Like, she was like, she, and I told her,
[03:58:13.960 --> 03:58:15.280]   I said, look, if you start digging,
[03:58:15.280 --> 03:58:17.120]   if you find out my name, like, I'll leave.
[03:58:17.120 --> 03:58:19.600]   Like, there's certain things that catch you.
[03:58:19.600 --> 03:58:23.080]   Staying in contact with people that you know,
[03:58:23.080 --> 03:58:24.760]   that's how you get caught, you know?
[03:58:24.760 --> 03:58:27.080]   Going back to see people, that's how you get caught,
[03:58:27.080 --> 03:58:28.000]   you know?
[03:58:28.000 --> 03:58:30.840]   Telling people who you are, that's how you get caught.
[03:58:30.840 --> 03:58:34.060]   And I was like, so, I'm Joseph Carter.
[03:58:34.060 --> 03:58:36.320]   Everything's fine.
[03:58:36.320 --> 03:58:38.600]   And she was like, okay.
[03:58:38.600 --> 03:58:40.320]   You know, and keep in mind, too,
[03:58:40.320 --> 03:58:43.960]   this girl, do you, oh, your car's broken?
[03:58:43.960 --> 03:58:45.560]   Or your car's not doing well?
[03:58:45.560 --> 03:58:46.440]   Take it and trade it in.
[03:58:46.440 --> 03:58:47.320]   We'll go get you another car.
[03:58:47.320 --> 03:58:51.200]   We'll go get you, you know, an Infiniti FX or whatever,
[03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:53.720]   you know, a $55,000, $60,000 vehicle.
[03:58:53.720 --> 03:58:57.520]   She's driving the equivalent of a beat-up old Nova.
[03:58:57.520 --> 03:58:59.920]   You know, I mean, it's, you wanna go on vacation?
[03:58:59.920 --> 03:59:00.760]   We'll go on vacation.
[03:59:00.760 --> 03:59:01.600]   You wanna do this?
[03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:02.420]   You wanna do that?
[03:59:02.420 --> 03:59:04.280]   So, you know, we're buying houses.
[03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:06.080]   We're renovating houses.
[03:59:06.080 --> 03:59:08.040]   We're building brand new houses.
[03:59:08.040 --> 03:59:09.160]   We're buying lots.
[03:59:09.160 --> 03:59:12.700]   Like, she's like in the middle of this, like, holy Jesus.
[03:59:12.700 --> 03:59:15.080]   There's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank,
[03:59:15.080 --> 03:59:17.920]   in our bank account, her bank account.
[03:59:17.920 --> 03:59:20.040]   I open up a corporation in her name.
[03:59:20.040 --> 03:59:21.520]   She's opening a bank account.
[03:59:21.520 --> 03:59:23.320]   She's got web, there's websites.
[03:59:23.320 --> 03:59:24.960]   It's a lot.
[03:59:24.960 --> 03:59:28.320]   And while this is happening,
[03:59:28.320 --> 03:59:34.620]   we start seeing a friend of hers.
[03:59:34.620 --> 03:59:37.200]   So, this other girl comes in the picture.
[03:59:37.200 --> 03:59:38.540]   Her name's Trina.
[03:59:38.540 --> 03:59:41.960]   And Trina is
[03:59:41.960 --> 03:59:46.440]   semi-lesbian?
[03:59:46.440 --> 03:59:47.280]   So--
[03:59:47.280 --> 03:59:49.880]   - Is this like a sexual thing?
[03:59:49.880 --> 03:59:51.400]   - Yeah, so-- - Or actual relationship?
[03:59:51.400 --> 03:59:53.720]   - No, it's more like she's coming over
[03:59:53.720 --> 03:59:55.240]   a couple times a week.
[03:59:55.240 --> 03:59:57.820]   So, we've got a ton going on.
[03:59:57.820 --> 04:00:03.240]   And, how do I put this?
[04:00:03.240 --> 04:00:05.720]   So, while this is happening,
[04:00:05.720 --> 04:00:09.140]   I end up coming out in, like, several magazines.
[04:00:09.140 --> 04:00:12.760]   So, I'm thinking this whole thing's dying down.
[04:00:12.760 --> 04:00:13.960]   But it's not dying down.
[04:00:13.960 --> 04:00:16.520]   Because now I just got caught and handcuffed in a bank,
[04:00:16.520 --> 04:00:19.480]   walked out of the police station, outran marshals.
[04:00:19.480 --> 04:00:21.720]   Although, that part, the marshal thing,
[04:00:21.720 --> 04:00:24.400]   never, was never in the papers.
[04:00:24.400 --> 04:00:28.400]   But, the getting caught and handcuffed in the bank,
[04:00:28.400 --> 04:00:30.760]   when that hit the papers, that's everywhere, bro.
[04:00:30.760 --> 04:00:31.880]   That's huge, you know?
[04:00:31.880 --> 04:00:34.160]   Suddenly, Chicago Tribune's running a series,
[04:00:34.160 --> 04:00:36.080]   The Fugitives.
[04:00:36.080 --> 04:00:37.720]   I'm in Bloomberg Businessweek.
[04:00:37.720 --> 04:00:40.000]   They run an article called, you know,
[04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:42.400]   "Sharks in the Housing Pool."
[04:00:42.400 --> 04:00:45.160]   Then you've got, Fortune Magazine comes out with a thing.
[04:00:45.160 --> 04:00:46.520]   Because by now, guess what?
[04:00:46.520 --> 04:00:48.680]   Becky's been caught.
[04:00:48.680 --> 04:00:49.520]   - Oh, Becky.
[04:00:49.520 --> 04:00:50.360]   - Becky.
[04:00:50.360 --> 04:00:51.180]   Oh, Becky.
[04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:52.360]   - Is she in Houston or whatever?
[04:00:52.360 --> 04:00:54.080]   - In Houston, got caught.
[04:00:54.080 --> 04:00:55.760]   - And, did she?
[04:00:55.760 --> 04:00:57.440]   - But, gangster, bro.
[04:00:57.440 --> 04:00:58.540]   Like, the way she, here's the thing.
[04:00:58.540 --> 04:01:00.480]   - Hey, hey, there you go.
[04:01:00.480 --> 04:01:02.440]   - No, oh no, she told on me immediately.
[04:01:02.440 --> 04:01:03.360]   - Oh, she did?
[04:01:03.360 --> 04:01:04.200]   Oh, no.
[04:01:04.200 --> 04:01:05.640]   - It's fine, she did the right thing.
[04:01:05.640 --> 04:01:06.960]   So, here's what's funny about that, though.
[04:01:06.960 --> 04:01:08.200]   - I don't know about that.
[04:01:08.200 --> 04:01:09.960]   - She, here's what she says.
[04:01:09.960 --> 04:01:12.080]   - Loyalty's everything in this world, my friend.
[04:01:12.080 --> 04:01:13.480]   That, you and I disagree on.
[04:01:13.480 --> 04:01:14.800]   - I just took off.
[04:01:14.800 --> 04:01:15.760]   I just took off.
[04:01:15.760 --> 04:01:16.600]   - Still.
[04:01:16.600 --> 04:01:18.480]   - And, then, I caught her and left her with,
[04:01:18.480 --> 04:01:22.720]   listen, with like five or $600,000 is what I left her with.
[04:01:22.720 --> 04:01:25.840]   - It's not all about money, Matthew.
[04:01:25.840 --> 04:01:29.640]   It's also about just, you know, ride or die.
[04:01:29.640 --> 04:01:30.840]   There's a meaning to that.
[04:01:30.840 --> 04:01:31.680]   - Oh, my God.
[04:01:31.680 --> 04:01:32.500]   - I'm sorry.
[04:01:32.500 --> 04:01:33.600]   Go ahead, go ahead.
[04:01:33.600 --> 04:01:35.520]   She told on, she said everything.
[04:01:35.520 --> 04:01:37.080]   - Well, here's what, when I say gangster,
[04:01:37.080 --> 04:01:38.600]   when she gets caught.
[04:01:38.600 --> 04:01:39.440]   - Yeah.
[04:01:39.440 --> 04:01:43.000]   - They come in, she's in the middle of beauty school.
[04:01:43.000 --> 04:01:44.520]   She's paid for beauty school.
[04:01:44.520 --> 04:01:45.560]   She's going through beauty school.
[04:01:45.560 --> 04:01:47.280]   She's going to open like a salon or something.
[04:01:47.280 --> 04:01:49.240]   So, she's in there cutting hair in a class,
[04:01:49.240 --> 04:01:50.120]   you know, on a mannequin.
[04:01:50.120 --> 04:01:52.960]   And, all of a sudden, like five or six
[04:01:52.960 --> 04:01:56.200]   Secret Service agents come in, guns drawn, screaming,
[04:01:56.200 --> 04:01:57.680]   "Get on the ground, get on the ground."
[04:01:57.680 --> 04:01:59.440]   She said, "Everybody drop the ground."
[04:01:59.440 --> 04:02:01.640]   She said, "I'm sitting there with scissors going."
[04:02:01.640 --> 04:02:05.560]   You know, they grab her, they handcuff her.
[04:02:05.560 --> 04:02:06.440]   They bring her in.
[04:02:06.440 --> 04:02:09.080]   And, the whole time, now, at that point, she was Rebecca,
[04:02:09.080 --> 04:02:11.880]   well, she was, her name was Rebecca Hickey.
[04:02:11.880 --> 04:02:13.320]   She went by Becca.
[04:02:13.320 --> 04:02:15.440]   So, she's Rebecca Hickey,
[04:02:15.440 --> 04:02:17.840]   which is, you know, she's got a Texas driver's license,
[04:02:17.840 --> 04:02:18.960]   the whole thing.
[04:02:18.960 --> 04:02:21.040]   And, they're screaming at her.
[04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:22.360]   And, they put her in the car,
[04:02:22.360 --> 04:02:23.680]   and they're driving the whole way.
[04:02:23.680 --> 04:02:26.240]   She goes, the guy, the Secret Service agent told me,
[04:02:26.240 --> 04:02:30.320]   45 minutes, she's telling us, "You're losing your job, bro.
[04:02:30.320 --> 04:02:31.240]   "You're losing."
[04:02:31.240 --> 04:02:33.200]   I mean, he's like, "I couldn't believe it.
[04:02:33.200 --> 04:02:34.800]   "Like, we've got pictures of her."
[04:02:34.800 --> 04:02:35.640]   We're like, "This is you."
[04:02:35.640 --> 04:02:37.560]   She's like, "That's not me.
[04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:39.240]   "Are you insane?
[04:02:39.240 --> 04:02:40.840]   "Look at that chubby little thing."
[04:02:40.840 --> 04:02:42.920]   I'm like, "Great, she's..."
[04:02:42.920 --> 04:02:45.520]   Would not budge till they actually put her hand
[04:02:45.520 --> 04:02:46.560]   on the scanner.
[04:02:46.560 --> 04:02:48.760]   And, she goes, "Okay, I'm Rebecca Houk.
[04:02:48.760 --> 04:02:49.760]   "What do you need?"
[04:02:49.760 --> 04:02:51.840]   They're like, "Where's Matt Cox?"
[04:02:51.840 --> 04:02:52.680]   She's like, "I have no idea.
[04:02:52.680 --> 04:02:55.200]   "That fucker left me like a year ago."
[04:02:55.200 --> 04:02:56.040]   So...
[04:02:56.040 --> 04:03:00.000]   - But, she contributed to the story,
[04:03:00.000 --> 04:03:01.760]   to the legend that's already growing.
[04:03:01.760 --> 04:03:05.800]   - Oh, because she was interviewed by Fortune Magazine.
[04:03:05.800 --> 04:03:07.560]   And, it was horrendous.
[04:03:07.560 --> 04:03:08.960]   The article is horrendous.
[04:03:08.960 --> 04:03:10.560]   He was abusive.
[04:03:10.960 --> 04:03:14.880]   He's a Don Juan that forced me to fall in love with him,
[04:03:14.880 --> 04:03:16.320]   commit mortgage fraud,
[04:03:16.320 --> 04:03:19.240]   and then took all the money and left.
[04:03:19.240 --> 04:03:23.360]   By the way, they found like 40 or 50 grand on her,
[04:03:23.360 --> 04:03:25.880]   and maybe another 30 or 40 in her bank account,
[04:03:25.880 --> 04:03:27.140]   and no other money.
[04:03:27.140 --> 04:03:30.400]   - Yeah.
[04:03:30.400 --> 04:03:32.200]   - Where's the other money?
[04:03:32.200 --> 04:03:33.720]   So, anyway.
[04:03:33.720 --> 04:03:35.200]   And, she was, by the way, she got caught.
[04:03:35.200 --> 04:03:37.960]   She was in communication with her family.
[04:03:39.280 --> 04:03:40.760]   So, she's talking to her mom.
[04:03:40.760 --> 04:03:42.000]   - That's when she got caught, ultimately.
[04:03:42.000 --> 04:03:44.260]   - And, her mother, through multiple conversations,
[04:03:44.260 --> 04:03:46.480]   one conversation being,
[04:03:46.480 --> 04:03:48.020]   "Mom, I'm doing fine.
[04:03:48.020 --> 04:03:50.260]   "I can't tell you where I am exactly,
[04:03:50.260 --> 04:03:51.660]   "but I'm in Houston, Texas.
[04:03:51.660 --> 04:03:52.500]   "I'm fine."
[04:03:52.500 --> 04:03:55.160]   Next one, six months later,
[04:03:55.160 --> 04:03:56.800]   I enrolled in beauty school.
[04:03:56.800 --> 04:03:58.520]   Houston, Texas beauty school.
[04:03:58.520 --> 04:03:59.840]   How many are there?
[04:03:59.840 --> 04:04:02.180]   And, her mom, bipolar.
[04:04:02.180 --> 04:04:04.320]   "I just wanna see my daughter."
[04:04:04.320 --> 04:04:06.320]   I'm gonna call the Secret Service.
[04:04:06.320 --> 04:04:08.080]   "I'm doing the right thing."
[04:04:08.080 --> 04:04:09.760]   And, honestly, she is doing the right thing.
[04:04:09.760 --> 04:04:11.320]   So--
[04:04:11.320 --> 04:04:13.720]   - So, you're getting more and more famous.
[04:04:13.720 --> 04:04:14.560]   - It's bad.
[04:04:14.560 --> 04:04:15.380]   - Nationally.
[04:04:15.380 --> 04:04:16.220]   - Right.
[04:04:16.220 --> 04:04:18.080]   So, I've got all these houses.
[04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:20.180]   - You're having a threesome with Amanda and Trina.
[04:04:20.180 --> 04:04:24.280]   - And, what ends up happening is,
[04:04:24.280 --> 04:04:26.100]   we end up going, and listen,
[04:04:26.100 --> 04:04:27.720]   Amanda and I, we've gone on,
[04:04:27.720 --> 04:04:31.440]   we've gone to Greece, Italy,
[04:04:31.440 --> 04:04:37.720]   Croatia, we're going on multiple just,
[04:04:37.720 --> 04:04:42.080]   multiple trips, and we've just gotten back
[04:04:42.080 --> 04:04:45.360]   from a 10-day cruise of the Greek Isles.
[04:04:45.360 --> 04:04:51.360]   And, there's, we get home,
[04:04:51.360 --> 04:04:52.960]   and Amanda goes online,
[04:04:52.960 --> 04:04:57.220]   and there's a blog about Dateline,
[04:04:57.220 --> 04:04:59.840]   about one of their new specials,
[04:04:59.840 --> 04:05:02.000]   called The Thief of Hearts.
[04:05:02.000 --> 04:05:03.160]   And, that's me.
[04:05:03.160 --> 04:05:05.480]   Apparently, I'm the thief of hearts.
[04:05:05.480 --> 04:05:08.240]   And, I'm apparently going around,
[04:05:08.240 --> 04:05:13.240]   and it's based on Rebecca's, Becky's story,
[04:05:13.240 --> 04:05:16.420]   that I'm wooing women to commit fraud,
[04:05:16.420 --> 04:05:17.260]   stealing all the money,
[04:05:17.260 --> 04:05:19.020]   and then leaving them to hold the bag.
[04:05:19.020 --> 04:05:22.420]   Well, they interviewed her.
[04:05:22.420 --> 04:05:24.240]   They're interviewing multiple people,
[04:05:24.240 --> 04:05:27.160]   multiple, in my case.
[04:05:27.160 --> 04:05:28.120]   They put together this,
[04:05:28.120 --> 04:05:30.600]   they're putting together an episode,
[04:05:30.600 --> 04:05:33.240]   gonna be released in a month or so.
[04:05:33.240 --> 04:05:34.680]   So, I'm terrified.
[04:05:34.680 --> 04:05:36.760]   I've, at this point, I've been on the run three years,
[04:05:36.760 --> 04:05:38.160]   and I'm like, there's lots of things
[04:05:38.160 --> 04:05:39.220]   I could care less about.
[04:05:39.220 --> 04:05:41.520]   Fortune, I don't know anybody that reads Fortune.
[04:05:41.520 --> 04:05:43.960]   Bloomberg, come on, I hang out with,
[04:05:43.960 --> 04:05:46.000]   I'm hanging out with contractors and laborers,
[04:05:46.000 --> 04:05:47.760]   and I'm not hanging out with these guys.
[04:05:47.760 --> 04:05:52.360]   So, local news, who cares?
[04:05:52.360 --> 04:05:56.120]   Even local news channels, I don't care.
[04:05:56.120 --> 04:06:01.120]   But, Dateline, there weren't 400 channels back then.
[04:06:01.120 --> 04:06:03.200]   So, Dateline comes out,
[04:06:03.200 --> 04:06:04.700]   even if you don't see it the first time,
[04:06:04.700 --> 04:06:06.840]   they're gonna rerun it in three months, or six months,
[04:06:06.840 --> 04:06:08.300]   or five years, 10 years from now,
[04:06:08.300 --> 04:06:09.860]   they might rerun it again.
[04:06:09.860 --> 04:06:11.200]   My face is gonna be on it.
[04:06:11.200 --> 04:06:13.360]   So, I could be perfectly fine five years from now,
[04:06:13.360 --> 04:06:17.680]   and one day, the barista that I go to every other day
[04:06:17.680 --> 04:06:20.200]   looks at Dateline and goes, oh my God,
[04:06:20.200 --> 04:06:24.080]   that's Mr. Johnson, or that's Mr. Thomas, or whatever.
[04:06:24.080 --> 04:06:26.460]   So, the point is, is that I was like, I gotta go.
[04:06:26.460 --> 04:06:27.300]   I can't stay here.
[04:06:27.300 --> 04:06:28.400]   I gotta get out of the country.
[04:06:28.400 --> 04:06:29.940]   So, I was gonna go to,
[04:06:29.940 --> 04:06:32.820]   well, we really started doing research,
[04:06:32.820 --> 04:06:36.280]   and Amanda ended up saying Australia.
[04:06:36.280 --> 04:06:38.800]   Australia, at the time, I don't know how it is now,
[04:06:38.800 --> 04:06:41.240]   but at the time, if you went to Australia
[04:06:41.240 --> 04:06:46.240]   with like $100,000, and a business plan,
[04:06:46.240 --> 04:06:50.160]   you could become a permanent resident alien.
[04:06:50.160 --> 04:06:53.960]   You can't vote, but you can buy property.
[04:06:53.960 --> 04:06:56.860]   You can open a business, but you can't get a job.
[04:06:56.860 --> 04:06:59.200]   And they didn't require fingerprints.
[04:06:59.200 --> 04:07:03.100]   So, there's no criminal background check.
[04:07:03.100 --> 04:07:04.440]   Now, if you wanted to be a citizen,
[04:07:04.440 --> 04:07:06.460]   you have to get an FBI criminal background check.
[04:07:06.460 --> 04:07:08.780]   Like, no, I'm good.
[04:07:08.780 --> 04:07:11.180]   So, I was like, wow, I can go there and start a business,
[04:07:11.180 --> 04:07:14.020]   and I'm gonna show up with a couple million.
[04:07:14.020 --> 04:07:16.860]   So, what we do is we start refinancing houses.
[04:07:16.860 --> 04:07:19.260]   We'll start pulling out money as quick as we can.
[04:07:19.260 --> 04:07:23.360]   I'm asking guys, laborers, guys that I work with,
[04:07:23.360 --> 04:07:25.580]   my general contractor, my real estate agent,
[04:07:25.580 --> 04:07:28.100]   hey man, can you cash this check for six grand?
[04:07:28.100 --> 04:07:28.940]   Nobody says no.
[04:07:28.940 --> 04:07:30.680]   Everybody, yeah, no problem, no problem.
[04:07:30.680 --> 04:07:32.800]   Few guys like, yeah, man, if you give me 10%,
[04:07:32.800 --> 04:07:34.680]   yeah, I'll give you 10%.
[04:07:34.680 --> 04:07:36.360]   So, that's happening.
[04:07:36.360 --> 04:07:37.660]   We're pulling out cash.
[04:07:37.660 --> 04:07:47.340]   One day, Amanda gives Trina a bunch of checks
[04:07:47.340 --> 04:07:50.220]   and asks her to cash 'em.
[04:07:50.220 --> 04:07:54.760]   That sparks a conversation that, like, what's happening.
[04:07:55.680 --> 04:08:00.080]   She confides in, by this point, by the way,
[04:08:00.080 --> 04:08:01.320]   Amanda knows who I am.
[04:08:01.320 --> 04:08:05.320]   So, by this point, she's actually came across the letter
[04:08:05.320 --> 04:08:08.680]   that I wrote to my parents when I left Tampa.
[04:08:08.680 --> 04:08:10.360]   So, she's figured out who I am.
[04:08:10.360 --> 04:08:14.560]   She tells Trina his name's Matt Cox.
[04:08:14.560 --> 04:08:15.800]   Date line's coming out.
[04:08:15.800 --> 04:08:18.500]   We're leaving, we gotta get a bunch of cash.
[04:08:18.500 --> 04:08:21.480]   And Trina goes, okay, I'll cash the checks.
[04:08:21.480 --> 04:08:24.520]   What she does instead is she calls the Secret Service.
[04:08:24.520 --> 04:08:26.760]   They watch my house for three days.
[04:08:26.760 --> 04:08:28.060]   I come home one day.
[04:08:28.060 --> 04:08:33.240]   They pull the cars up, and they arrest me.
[04:08:33.240 --> 04:08:36.960]   So, it's a little bit longer than that,
[04:08:36.960 --> 04:08:41.360]   but that's a short version of me getting arrested,
[04:08:41.360 --> 04:08:43.040]   and I've probably skipped over a whole bunch of--
[04:08:43.040 --> 04:08:44.720]   - It's so simple, because you've gotten away
[04:08:44.720 --> 04:08:47.140]   with much more complex situations.
[04:08:47.140 --> 04:08:50.340]   - It's women, man, it's women.
[04:08:50.340 --> 04:08:52.160]   Just joking.
[04:08:52.160 --> 04:08:53.520]   (laughs)
[04:08:53.520 --> 04:08:56.640]   - They also are the thing that make life worthwhile.
[04:08:56.640 --> 04:08:58.580]   - Listen, God bless Trina.
[04:08:58.580 --> 04:09:00.340]   She did the right thing.
[04:09:00.340 --> 04:09:01.180]   Honestly, based on--
[04:09:01.180 --> 04:09:02.720]   - There you go, back to the right thing.
[04:09:02.720 --> 04:09:04.760]   - But, I mean, based on what she saw,
[04:09:04.760 --> 04:09:07.780]   based on what the Secret Service told her,
[04:09:07.780 --> 04:09:12.320]   and the articles that she's reading, I'm a bad guy.
[04:09:12.320 --> 04:09:14.000]   I mean, I'm a bad guy in general, right?
[04:09:14.000 --> 04:09:15.520]   So, I don't deserve loyalty.
[04:09:15.520 --> 04:09:16.540]   I don't think so.
[04:09:16.540 --> 04:09:19.560]   I'm ripping people off, and she's thinking
[04:09:19.560 --> 04:09:22.300]   that her friend is in danger.
[04:09:23.140 --> 04:09:25.660]   You know, the FBI is saying I have a weapon.
[04:09:25.660 --> 04:09:28.420]   He's dangerous, he's got a weapon.
[04:09:28.420 --> 04:09:30.340]   We believe he's armed and dangerous.
[04:09:30.340 --> 04:09:33.340]   When I was in Florida, I had a concealed weapons permit,
[04:09:33.340 --> 04:09:36.940]   but I had gotten rid of both my guns
[04:09:36.940 --> 04:09:38.020]   when I was placed on probation.
[04:09:38.020 --> 04:09:38.900]   I've never had one since.
[04:09:38.900 --> 04:09:40.580]   I've never touched a gun since.
[04:09:40.580 --> 04:09:42.980]   But they used that to say, you know,
[04:09:42.980 --> 04:09:44.580]   they said, oh, he had a concealed weapons permit?
[04:09:44.580 --> 04:09:46.300]   Okay, well, then he's armed and dangerous.
[04:09:46.300 --> 04:09:47.180]   Like, there's these little things,
[04:09:47.180 --> 04:09:49.220]   and think, they're telling her, read this article.
[04:09:49.220 --> 04:09:51.340]   Look, he forces girls to fall in love with him,
[04:09:51.340 --> 04:09:54.420]   and that's what he's gonna do to your friend.
[04:09:54.420 --> 04:09:57.180]   So, she negotiated, also, I think she got 10,000.
[04:09:57.180 --> 04:09:58.300]   I think, which is embarrassing.
[04:09:58.300 --> 04:10:01.060]   I'm ashamed that she got $10,000.
[04:10:01.060 --> 04:10:03.500]   - And said everything.
[04:10:03.500 --> 04:10:05.380]   - Yeah, and told them this is where he is.
[04:10:05.380 --> 04:10:07.020]   His name is Joseph Carter.
[04:10:07.020 --> 04:10:10.980]   You know, this is where he is.
[04:10:10.980 --> 04:10:12.980]   They watch it, they grab me, they arrest me.
[04:10:12.980 --> 04:10:16.220]   They bring me downtown, you know.
[04:10:16.220 --> 04:10:18.540]   - What did you feel like when you got--
[04:10:18.540 --> 04:10:19.380]   - I didn't feel good, bro.
[04:10:19.380 --> 04:10:20.580]   It was bad, it was a bad day.
[04:10:20.580 --> 04:10:21.420]   It was a bad day.
[04:10:21.420 --> 04:10:27.420]   First of all, Casino Royale was coming out on Friday.
[04:10:27.420 --> 04:10:33.300]   It was the first Daniel Craig as James Bond.
[04:10:33.300 --> 04:10:34.300]   - Yeah.
[04:10:34.300 --> 04:10:37.460]   - And the whole week, I'd been telling Amanda,
[04:10:37.460 --> 04:10:38.820]   I'm gonna go see Casino Royale.
[04:10:38.820 --> 04:10:40.100]   She'd go, okay, well, on Saturday,
[04:10:40.100 --> 04:10:41.060]   we're gonna go to the festival.
[04:10:41.060 --> 04:10:44.100]   I'd go, that's fine, but on Friday, Casino,
[04:10:44.100 --> 04:10:45.460]   and she's like, right, Casino Royale.
[04:10:45.460 --> 04:10:46.460]   And then she's like, okay, by the way,
[04:10:46.460 --> 04:10:48.020]   on Thursday, I thought we could go to dinner.
[04:10:48.020 --> 04:10:51.420]   That's fine, but on Friday, Casino Royale.
[04:10:51.420 --> 04:10:52.700]   And when they put the handcuffs on,
[04:10:52.700 --> 04:10:54.740]   you know the first thing I thought of?
[04:10:54.740 --> 04:10:56.580]   I'm not gonna fucking sit to see Casino Royale.
[04:10:56.580 --> 04:10:58.100]   I'm not gonna get to see it.
[04:10:58.100 --> 04:10:58.940]   Not gonna see it.
[04:10:58.940 --> 04:11:01.340]   And I saw it about five, six years later
[04:11:01.340 --> 04:11:04.140]   on the institution's movie channel.
[04:11:04.140 --> 04:11:05.300]   You know, it was nice.
[04:11:05.300 --> 04:11:10.300]   It's not the same, but yeah, so they bring me to Nashville.
[04:11:10.300 --> 04:11:15.540]   Then they transport me to all over the place.
[04:11:15.540 --> 04:11:18.100]   I go on, you know, Conair.
[04:11:18.100 --> 04:11:19.780]   They fly me to Oklahoma.
[04:11:19.780 --> 04:11:24.080]   They fly me to Atlanta.
[04:11:24.080 --> 04:11:26.020]   Then I go to Atlanta.
[04:11:26.020 --> 04:11:28.680]   I'm placed in the U.S. Marshal's holdover.
[04:11:28.680 --> 04:11:30.820]   I get assigned an attorney.
[04:11:30.820 --> 04:11:32.200]   Go in front of the judge.
[04:11:32.200 --> 04:11:35.600]   Plead not guilty.
[04:11:35.600 --> 04:11:37.620]   Meet with my attorney.
[04:11:37.620 --> 04:11:39.000]   You always plead not guilty, you know?
[04:11:39.000 --> 04:11:39.840]   Whenever you face people and say,
[04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:41.500]   can you believe that he pled not guilty?
[04:11:41.500 --> 04:11:42.980]   That's the first thing.
[04:11:42.980 --> 04:11:44.340]   Nobody walks in and pleads guilty.
[04:11:44.340 --> 04:11:45.780]   You plead not guilty while you kind of
[04:11:45.780 --> 04:11:46.980]   figure out what you're gonna do.
[04:11:46.980 --> 04:11:48.320]   So I plead not guilty.
[04:11:48.320 --> 04:11:50.860]   There's no bond, obviously.
[04:11:50.860 --> 04:11:51.920]   I've got, they caught me.
[04:11:51.920 --> 04:11:54.900]   When they caught me, I had four or five passports.
[04:11:54.900 --> 04:11:57.320]   So that's no good.
[04:11:57.320 --> 04:12:02.740]   They charged me with bank fraud,
[04:12:02.740 --> 04:12:04.260]   conspiracy to commit bank fraud,
[04:12:04.260 --> 04:12:09.140]   wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud,
[04:12:09.140 --> 04:12:12.580]   conspiracy, or what was the other one?
[04:12:12.580 --> 04:12:16.220]   Aggravated identity theft, money laundering,
[04:12:16.220 --> 04:12:18.300]   use of a fraudulent passport.
[04:12:18.300 --> 04:12:23.180]   And there's like 30 counts of this,
[04:12:23.180 --> 04:12:25.540]   20 counts of this, 20, but none of that matters.
[04:12:25.540 --> 04:12:27.620]   Like even if you just dropped all the counts
[04:12:27.620 --> 04:12:28.920]   to one count and stacked them,
[04:12:28.920 --> 04:12:30.620]   it's like 150 something years.
[04:12:30.620 --> 04:12:31.460]   Not that they're--
[04:12:31.460 --> 04:12:32.660]   - So everything, everything they put in.
[04:12:32.660 --> 04:12:33.780]   - And that's what they always say.
[04:12:33.780 --> 04:12:35.380]   You're looking at 150,000.
[04:12:35.380 --> 04:12:36.520]   And your lawyers, they're like,
[04:12:36.520 --> 04:12:37.360]   you're not looking at that.
[04:12:37.360 --> 04:12:39.160]   You're looking at 54 years.
[04:12:39.160 --> 04:12:41.300]   What, that's no better?
[04:12:41.300 --> 04:12:42.780]   That's no better?
[04:12:42.780 --> 04:12:47.400]   So yeah, so my lawyer comes in and sees me one day,
[04:12:47.400 --> 04:12:50.260]   you know, like our first meeting.
[04:12:50.260 --> 04:12:53.420]   And she says, you know, I'm Millie, Millie Dunn.
[04:12:53.420 --> 04:12:58.700]   And she says, listen, I've looked at everything.
[04:12:58.700 --> 04:13:02.140]   For first, they say, you're responsible for,
[04:13:02.140 --> 04:13:06.940]   it's like 25 or 30, 25 or $26 million in loss.
[04:13:06.940 --> 04:13:08.820]   And I'm like, that's, I've never, that's not true.
[04:13:08.820 --> 04:13:10.220]   That's not true.
[04:13:10.220 --> 04:13:11.900]   And I was like, you know, not even,
[04:13:11.900 --> 04:13:13.820]   I said, not even potential loss.
[04:13:13.820 --> 04:13:14.660]   There's just no way.
[04:13:14.660 --> 04:13:15.500]   I mean, there's no way.
[04:13:15.500 --> 04:13:17.680]   And then they come back, she comes back and she says,
[04:13:17.680 --> 04:13:22.220]   well, they're saying 19 million.
[04:13:22.220 --> 04:13:23.860]   Now, it's not possible.
[04:13:23.860 --> 04:13:26.300]   Tiny thing, I don't, I didn't, no.
[04:13:26.300 --> 04:13:30.300]   So when the FBI is saying like 40 million,
[04:13:30.300 --> 04:13:33.160]   they're saying 11.5 in Tampa,
[04:13:33.160 --> 04:13:35.460]   plus 40 million for the mortgage company.
[04:13:35.460 --> 04:13:39.180]   So it ends up being like, plus what I stole on the run,
[04:13:39.180 --> 04:13:40.780]   it ends up being like 55 million.
[04:13:40.780 --> 04:13:42.900]   But she gets them to drop like the 40.
[04:13:42.900 --> 04:13:45.980]   Like that's his brokers, that's this, that's that,
[04:13:45.980 --> 04:13:48.260]   drop it, and they're like, he's so done.
[04:13:48.260 --> 04:13:49.260]   It doesn't matter, they drop that.
[04:13:49.260 --> 04:13:52.460]   So it ends up, it ends up being like 15 million.
[04:13:52.460 --> 04:13:54.420]   And then it's down to, what does he owe?
[04:13:54.420 --> 04:13:58.200]   They said 9.5, and I got it down to like six million.
[04:13:58.200 --> 04:14:01.580]   So, you know, which, you know, I'm good for.
[04:14:01.580 --> 04:14:06.020]   So what ends up happening is they've charged me
[04:14:06.020 --> 04:14:11.020]   with all these things, and she's like, okay, you know,
[04:14:11.020 --> 04:14:16.020]   you're like, you can plead guilty,
[04:14:16.020 --> 04:14:18.460]   and you can go with the sentencing guidelines,
[04:14:18.460 --> 04:14:21.860]   which is gonna be like, she's like, I mean, it depends.
[04:14:21.860 --> 04:14:24.500]   She said it might be whatever, 54 years.
[04:14:24.500 --> 04:14:26.420]   She was, but if they run them, you know,
[04:14:26.420 --> 04:14:29.420]   concurrent or consecutive, depending on which one they do,
[04:14:29.420 --> 04:14:33.820]   she said most likely it ends up being like 30 years.
[04:14:33.820 --> 04:14:37.980]   You know, it's like, that's not good, that's not good.
[04:14:37.980 --> 04:14:39.940]   So we kind of go back and forth, back and forth,
[04:14:39.940 --> 04:14:42.700]   and figure out, try and figure out what I'm looking at.
[04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:48.060]   Now, as we go through the whole thing, we end up,
[04:14:48.060 --> 04:14:51.140]   she ends up with, she ends up saying, you know,
[04:14:51.140 --> 04:14:55.780]   she knocks off a bunch of stuff that they're saying I did.
[04:14:55.780 --> 04:14:58.460]   You know, enhancements.
[04:14:58.460 --> 04:15:02.620]   'Cause you'll have a base level of, let's say, level eight.
[04:15:02.620 --> 04:15:06.900]   You know, that should be, that should be maybe a few years.
[04:15:06.900 --> 04:15:09.540]   But then they start adding on enhancements, you know.
[04:15:09.540 --> 04:15:13.860]   Did he, did what he do, was it sophisticated?
[04:15:13.860 --> 04:15:16.820]   Yes, okay, three levels for sophisticated means.
[04:15:16.820 --> 04:15:18.580]   Were there more than, how many victims?
[04:15:18.580 --> 04:15:19.740]   Were there more than 50 victims?
[04:15:19.740 --> 04:15:22.420]   Yes, okay, that's six more levels.
[04:15:22.420 --> 04:15:25.700]   Okay, did he change the jurisdiction to evade detection?
[04:15:25.700 --> 04:15:27.140]   Yes, that's four more levels.
[04:15:27.140 --> 04:15:29.420]   Okay, did he, they start adding, boom, boom,
[04:15:29.420 --> 04:15:31.720]   and when you start adding up all those levels,
[04:15:32.720 --> 04:15:34.040]   plus your criminal history,
[04:15:34.040 --> 04:15:35.160]   and I have a big criminal history
[04:15:35.160 --> 04:15:37.760]   because I was already on federal probation,
[04:15:37.760 --> 04:15:40.120]   and I committed a new crime on federal probation.
[04:15:40.120 --> 04:15:42.440]   So that was another enhancement.
[04:15:42.440 --> 04:15:44.160]   And this, you know, this case,
[04:15:44.160 --> 04:15:47.760]   so I'm in like a category, category two or three.
[04:15:47.760 --> 04:15:50.680]   So they come back and they're saying,
[04:15:50.680 --> 04:15:54.760]   I forget, it's like 20,
[04:15:54.760 --> 04:15:55.920]   well, they don't come back right away,
[04:15:55.920 --> 04:16:00.040]   but she ends up saying, you're probably looking at 14 years.
[04:16:00.040 --> 04:16:02.200]   Okay, that's reasonable, that's reasonable.
[04:16:02.200 --> 04:16:06.720]   And so she's saying, so we get the,
[04:16:06.720 --> 04:16:08.360]   when we get the PSI back,
[04:16:08.360 --> 04:16:10.680]   we eventually get what's called a percentage report.
[04:16:10.680 --> 04:16:14.540]   They're saying 26 years, but they really said 32 years.
[04:16:14.540 --> 04:16:19.760]   And I argued and we got it down to 26 years and four months.
[04:16:19.760 --> 04:16:22.000]   That's what it is, it's 316 months.
[04:16:22.000 --> 04:16:23.600]   That's how they do it in months.
[04:16:23.600 --> 04:16:28.440]   It doesn't sting that much, I guess, if you say months.
[04:16:29.440 --> 04:16:30.800]   - Yeah.
[04:16:30.800 --> 04:16:33.280]   - So she says to me, Millie sits down with me
[04:16:33.280 --> 04:16:38.280]   and she says, listen, you gotta cooperate.
[04:16:38.280 --> 04:16:39.880]   And I was like, okay.
[04:16:39.880 --> 04:16:42.800]   And she said, because you're guilty,
[04:16:42.800 --> 04:16:44.400]   you're extremely guilty.
[04:16:44.400 --> 04:16:46.960]   She's like, you can't go to trial.
[04:16:46.960 --> 04:16:49.240]   And she said, so you need to cooperate.
[04:16:49.240 --> 04:16:50.600]   I was like, well, what do I get if I cooperate?
[04:16:50.600 --> 04:16:52.800]   And she's, the way it works is you cooperate
[04:16:52.800 --> 04:16:56.760]   and you hope for the best.
[04:16:56.760 --> 04:16:58.080]   And I was like, are you serious?
[04:16:58.080 --> 04:16:59.440]   You tell them everything you know
[04:16:59.440 --> 04:17:01.040]   and you hope for the best.
[04:17:01.040 --> 04:17:03.320]   And she's like, what part of the problem is,
[04:17:03.320 --> 04:17:06.160]   she said, everybody in Tampa has cooperated.
[04:17:06.160 --> 04:17:08.400]   Rebecca has cooperated.
[04:17:08.400 --> 04:17:10.160]   Everyone across the board has cooperated.
[04:17:10.160 --> 04:17:12.200]   There's nobody that hasn't cooperated.
[04:17:12.200 --> 04:17:13.680]   - By the way, when you say cooperating,
[04:17:13.680 --> 04:17:15.840]   you mean they're an informant, they told.
[04:17:15.840 --> 04:17:17.440]   They said, AKA snitched.
[04:17:17.440 --> 04:17:19.800]   - Right, they came in, they sat down with their lawyer
[04:17:19.800 --> 04:17:21.200]   and they said, this is what he did.
[04:17:21.200 --> 04:17:22.360]   He did this, he did that.
[04:17:22.360 --> 04:17:23.400]   They showed him documents.
[04:17:23.400 --> 04:17:25.640]   Yes, yes, yes, that's my signature.
[04:17:25.640 --> 04:17:27.800]   I didn't know what that was.
[04:17:27.800 --> 04:17:28.920]   Everything was my fault.
[04:17:28.920 --> 04:17:29.760]   They didn't do anything.
[04:17:29.760 --> 04:17:31.280]   It was all me.
[04:17:31.280 --> 04:17:34.080]   So they've all cooperated and they haven't been charged.
[04:17:34.080 --> 04:17:34.920]   They've been indicted.
[04:17:34.920 --> 04:17:37.160]   They're all named as unnamed co-conspirators
[04:17:37.160 --> 04:17:38.440]   on my indictment.
[04:17:38.440 --> 04:17:40.120]   So I've got like 12 people.
[04:17:40.120 --> 04:17:41.640]   I mean, there's like probably 20 people that are involved,
[04:17:41.640 --> 04:17:43.680]   but there's like 12 of them that are,
[04:17:43.680 --> 04:17:48.200]   so I've got all these names, KB, DL, CY.
[04:17:48.200 --> 04:17:50.160]   It's like, I know who that is.
[04:17:50.160 --> 04:17:52.400]   Like, I know who DW, that's Dave Walker.
[04:17:52.400 --> 04:17:54.640]   I know who these people are.
[04:17:54.640 --> 04:17:55.680]   And so there's just a list of them.
[04:17:55.680 --> 04:17:57.840]   There's like 12 of them, you know, plus me.
[04:17:57.840 --> 04:18:04.040]   So, and some of them walked in and said, I'm guilty.
[04:18:04.040 --> 04:18:06.080]   I just want to be plead guilty.
[04:18:06.080 --> 04:18:10.520]   The girl, Allison, she walked in, said,
[04:18:10.520 --> 04:18:15.520]   I'm too, I'm tired of waiting for you to come get me.
[04:18:15.520 --> 04:18:16.700]   Walked in with her lawyer and said,
[04:18:16.700 --> 04:18:18.600]   I just want to plead guilty.
[04:18:18.600 --> 04:18:21.120]   And they sentenced her and she went to jail.
[04:18:21.120 --> 04:18:23.780]   She got like 36 months or 30 months.
[04:18:24.780 --> 04:18:29.780]   She called the prison that she went to,
[04:18:29.780 --> 04:18:34.380]   the low security, it was a female prison at the time,
[04:18:34.380 --> 04:18:36.940]   female camp, called the camp and asked her
[04:18:36.940 --> 04:18:40.020]   if she could come by for a tour before she went.
[04:18:40.020 --> 04:18:42.540]   And they went, excuse me?
[04:18:42.540 --> 04:18:45.660]   She said, well, I'm going to be there for about two years.
[04:18:45.660 --> 04:18:46.500]   So I'd like to come in.
[04:18:46.500 --> 04:18:47.860]   Is there like a tour I can take?
[04:18:47.860 --> 04:18:49.300]   'Cause I'd like to know where I'm going
[04:18:49.300 --> 04:18:51.860]   and what it's going to be like, how I should prepare.
[04:18:51.860 --> 04:18:53.100]   And they just started laughing.
[04:18:53.100 --> 04:18:54.620]   They said, there's no tour, sweetie.
[04:18:54.620 --> 04:18:56.500]   We'll give you the tour when you get here.
[04:18:56.500 --> 04:18:58.540]   (laughing)
[04:18:58.540 --> 04:18:59.820]   You gotta love that.
[04:18:59.820 --> 04:19:00.900]   - Yeah, I mean.
[04:19:00.900 --> 04:19:02.200]   - I thought I was, I didn't think,
[04:19:02.200 --> 04:19:04.080]   I thought I wasn't prepared.
[04:19:04.080 --> 04:19:06.700]   - I mean, there's no tour.
[04:19:06.700 --> 04:19:10.940]   - So Becky, Becky got 70 months,
[04:19:10.940 --> 04:19:12.940]   but when I got caught and when I was sentenced,
[04:19:12.940 --> 04:19:16.060]   they reduced it to like 30 or no, 40 to 40 months.
[04:19:16.060 --> 04:19:16.900]   They reduced--
[04:19:16.900 --> 04:19:20.180]   - Because she "cooperated" that term.
[04:19:20.180 --> 04:19:22.100]   - Right.
[04:19:22.100 --> 04:19:23.140]   - Is that how you say snitch?
[04:19:23.140 --> 04:19:25.900]   - Well, there must be, I mean,
[04:19:25.900 --> 04:19:29.500]   snitch is too harsh of a word, but yeah, the ratted.
[04:19:29.500 --> 04:19:32.300]   I mean, you're saying, I don't know.
[04:19:32.300 --> 04:19:33.140]   - We can get there.
[04:19:33.140 --> 04:19:33.960]   We'll get there.
[04:19:33.960 --> 04:19:36.060]   - All right, all right.
[04:19:36.060 --> 04:19:39.900]   So where did the sentencing end up?
[04:19:39.900 --> 04:19:44.900]   - So I should say first, on the cooperation subject,
[04:19:44.900 --> 04:19:49.700]   my lawyer wanted me to cooperate.
[04:19:49.700 --> 04:19:51.700]   And by this point, I realized like,
[04:19:51.700 --> 04:19:53.420]   you don't have a choice, you know?
[04:19:53.420 --> 04:19:55.120]   No, that's not true.
[04:19:55.120 --> 04:19:57.220]   I could have been a gangster.
[04:19:57.220 --> 04:19:58.660]   - Yeah.
[04:19:58.660 --> 04:20:00.220]   What does it mean to be a gangster in this case?
[04:20:00.220 --> 04:20:02.660]   - Like a standup guy.
[04:20:02.660 --> 04:20:05.180]   I could have said, I'll just take it.
[04:20:05.180 --> 04:20:07.880]   Give me 54 years, go fuck yourself.
[04:20:07.880 --> 04:20:09.580]   I'm not gonna snitch on nobody.
[04:20:09.580 --> 04:20:12.980]   And I know you look at me and you think, tough guy.
[04:20:12.980 --> 04:20:15.980]   I'm not a tough guy at all.
[04:20:15.980 --> 04:20:19.260]   I'm not doing 50 some odd years.
[04:20:19.260 --> 04:20:20.740]   Like I'm not doing it.
[04:20:20.740 --> 04:20:22.080]   I don't wanna do 30 years.
[04:20:22.080 --> 04:20:26.780]   I was hoping for, I knew it wasn't possible,
[04:20:26.780 --> 04:20:29.640]   but I would have satisfied for another slap on the hand
[04:20:29.640 --> 04:20:31.500]   like I got the first time.
[04:20:31.500 --> 04:20:33.080]   I really thought I deserved.
[04:20:33.080 --> 04:20:35.100]   Honestly, when my lawyer asked me,
[04:20:35.100 --> 04:20:35.940]   what do you really think you deserve?
[04:20:35.940 --> 04:20:38.300]   And I thought, I deserve 10 years.
[04:20:38.300 --> 04:20:39.500]   I deserve 10 years.
[04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:43.700]   But, so she said, look, they wanna talk to you.
[04:20:43.700 --> 04:20:48.940]   So the FBI, well, first the Secret Service flies in.
[04:20:49.900 --> 04:20:54.340]   They come in and they interview me.
[04:20:54.340 --> 04:20:57.900]   - Who's more terrifying, FBI, Secret Service?
[04:20:57.900 --> 04:21:02.320]   - The Secret Service was so overwhelmingly professional.
[04:21:02.320 --> 04:21:07.080]   The FBI, and really only,
[04:21:07.080 --> 04:21:10.740]   one of the FBI agents that interviewed me,
[04:21:10.740 --> 04:21:12.900]   I don't know how he's an agent.
[04:21:12.900 --> 04:21:13.740]   I don't know.
[04:21:13.740 --> 04:21:15.780]   He was just ineffective, incompetent.
[04:21:15.780 --> 04:21:17.700]   - Oh, so it's a competence issue.
[04:21:17.700 --> 04:21:20.420]   - The other one was Candace.
[04:21:20.420 --> 04:21:21.380]   - Oh, you met her eventually.
[04:21:21.380 --> 04:21:23.500]   - Of course I did, of course.
[04:21:23.500 --> 04:21:28.260]   She's 5'11", wearing three-inch heels.
[04:21:28.260 --> 04:21:32.940]   She's a giant, in impeccable shape, attractive,
[04:21:32.940 --> 04:21:36.460]   one of the angriest human beings I've ever met.
[04:21:36.460 --> 04:21:39.360]   And every FBI agent that I've met since then
[04:21:39.360 --> 04:21:42.580]   that knows her and I mention, they all say,
[04:21:42.580 --> 04:21:44.180]   what did you think of her?
[04:21:44.180 --> 04:21:45.860]   And I'm like, what, why?
[04:21:45.860 --> 04:21:48.900]   And I was like, kind of aggressively, yeah, yeah.
[04:21:48.900 --> 04:21:49.740]   She's a bulldog.
[04:21:49.740 --> 04:21:51.460]   She's, I mean, all of them are like, yeah, yeah.
[04:21:51.460 --> 04:21:53.120]   She's something else.
[04:21:53.120 --> 04:21:56.700]   - Secret Service is a little bit more professional.
[04:21:56.700 --> 04:21:58.340]   - Very personal, very, it's their job.
[04:21:58.340 --> 04:21:59.860]   It's like, hey, this is just my job.
[04:21:59.860 --> 04:22:02.700]   They're polite, professional, that's it.
[04:22:02.700 --> 04:22:05.300]   So it's just, this is just, this is my nine to five.
[04:22:05.300 --> 04:22:09.260]   So, but they come and they fly in
[04:22:09.260 --> 04:22:13.880]   and they meet with me for three, four days.
[04:22:14.980 --> 04:22:19.240]   One of the funny things is that when I first sat down
[04:22:19.240 --> 04:22:23.580]   with them, one guy's name was Dan,
[04:22:23.580 --> 04:22:26.340]   like Brozenskowski or something.
[04:22:26.340 --> 04:22:29.820]   So he sits down and he says, look, before we get started,
[04:22:29.820 --> 04:22:31.380]   we need to talk about something.
[04:22:31.380 --> 04:22:32.220]   And I said, what?
[04:22:32.220 --> 04:22:33.940]   He said, we know you've hidden money.
[04:22:33.940 --> 04:22:36.780]   And I was like, what?
[04:22:36.780 --> 04:22:39.780]   And he goes, we know you've got money hidden.
[04:22:39.780 --> 04:22:41.140]   I said, I don't have any money hidden.
[04:22:41.140 --> 04:22:41.980]   What are you talking about?
[04:22:41.980 --> 04:22:42.860]   And my lawyer's like, do we need to talk?
[04:22:42.860 --> 04:22:44.020]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, I don't have nothing.
[04:22:44.020 --> 04:22:47.580]   I gave you everything, all the accounts, you got everything.
[04:22:47.580 --> 04:22:51.300]   And he's like, you're looking at an obstruction charge
[04:22:51.300 --> 04:22:52.140]   at this point.
[04:22:52.140 --> 04:22:54.060]   I was like, I don't have anything.
[04:22:54.060 --> 04:22:56.440]   And he says, we know you have money.
[04:22:56.440 --> 04:22:58.740]   We know you have money in different IDs,
[04:22:58.740 --> 04:22:59.860]   different identities, names.
[04:22:59.860 --> 04:23:01.260]   And I go, what are you talking about?
[04:23:01.260 --> 04:23:04.140]   And he pulls out a bank statement
[04:23:04.140 --> 04:23:06.580]   and he slaps it on the counter and he goes,
[04:23:06.580 --> 04:23:11.020]   you've got money in Southern Exchange Bank.
[04:23:11.020 --> 04:23:14.140]   You've got $190,000 in Southern Exchange Bank.
[04:23:14.140 --> 04:23:15.980]   And I look at it and I went,
[04:23:15.980 --> 04:23:20.220]   it was in the name Walter Holcomb.
[04:23:20.220 --> 04:23:23.740]   And I went, did you call the bank?
[04:23:23.740 --> 04:23:25.660]   He says, yeah, we called the bank.
[04:23:25.660 --> 04:23:27.860]   I went, okay.
[04:23:27.860 --> 04:23:29.420]   Did anybody call you back?
[04:23:29.420 --> 04:23:31.940]   And they go, he said, no, we've left several messages.
[04:23:31.940 --> 04:23:33.900]   I said, did you go to the bank website?
[04:23:33.900 --> 04:23:34.860]   He goes, yeah, I went to the website.
[04:23:34.860 --> 04:23:36.540]   I said, what'd you think?
[04:23:36.540 --> 04:23:39.060]   And he went, what do you mean, it was the bank website?
[04:23:39.060 --> 04:23:40.780]   I said, yeah, but it was professional, right?
[04:23:40.780 --> 04:23:42.100]   It was like a professional website.
[04:23:42.100 --> 04:23:44.220]   And he goes, it's a bank website.
[04:23:44.220 --> 04:23:46.540]   And I go, yeah, but it was well done.
[04:23:46.540 --> 04:23:49.900]   And he goes, oh God.
[04:23:49.900 --> 04:23:51.980]   And I go, yeah, convincing.
[04:23:51.980 --> 04:23:54.620]   And I went, I go, it's all an illusion.
[04:23:54.620 --> 04:23:56.180]   And I said, the bank doesn't exist.
[04:23:56.180 --> 04:23:57.020]   It's a fake bank.
[04:23:57.020 --> 04:23:58.500]   I made the bank.
[04:23:58.500 --> 04:24:00.740]   Made it when I was in, not even in Tampa.
[04:24:00.740 --> 04:24:04.060]   I think I'd gotten to Nashville when I made it.
[04:24:04.060 --> 04:24:05.300]   And I was like, yeah, it's an illusion.
[04:24:05.300 --> 04:24:06.220]   The bank statements,
[04:24:06.220 --> 04:24:07.660]   he's like, they're color bank statements.
[04:24:07.660 --> 04:24:09.380]   I'm like, yeah, well, no shit.
[04:24:09.380 --> 04:24:11.660]   So, there's no, I said, a matter of fact,
[04:24:11.660 --> 04:24:13.020]   I said, who did you leave a,
[04:24:13.020 --> 04:24:17.220]   I haven't paid for the service in months.
[04:24:17.220 --> 04:24:18.900]   And he turned around and he called it
[04:24:18.900 --> 04:24:22.460]   and it went, it was disconnected.
[04:24:22.460 --> 04:24:24.500]   And I was like, how do you not know that's a bank?
[04:24:24.500 --> 04:24:27.860]   Well, it turns out there was a Sunderland Exchange Bank
[04:24:27.860 --> 04:24:30.540]   and I'd used their bank routing number.
[04:24:30.540 --> 04:24:33.180]   And so, I mean, I always thought that was funny
[04:24:33.180 --> 04:24:35.060]   that they, it's like, well, I remember,
[04:24:35.060 --> 04:24:36.140]   really for a split second there,
[04:24:36.140 --> 04:24:38.100]   I was kind of like really embarrassed that they caught me.
[04:24:38.100 --> 04:24:40.060]   I was like, I can't believe this.
[04:24:40.060 --> 04:24:41.700]   You're the Secret Service.
[04:24:41.700 --> 04:24:43.180]   Anyway, I talked to them.
[04:24:43.180 --> 04:24:45.420]   I, you know, there's really,
[04:24:45.420 --> 04:24:46.820]   as far as the Secret Service is concerned,
[04:24:46.820 --> 04:24:48.700]   there's just not much I can tell them.
[04:24:48.700 --> 04:24:52.540]   There's just, you know, like, it was me.
[04:24:52.540 --> 04:24:54.500]   Becky's already told them everything.
[04:24:54.500 --> 04:24:56.780]   Amanda's already told them everything.
[04:24:56.780 --> 04:24:57.940]   It's not hard to track.
[04:24:57.940 --> 04:25:01.940]   And when they raided my house, they've got boxes and boxes.
[04:25:01.940 --> 04:25:03.340]   So, it's laid out.
[04:25:03.340 --> 04:25:04.580]   We still, it took forever.
[04:25:04.580 --> 04:25:06.300]   Like, I still went through everything.
[04:25:06.300 --> 04:25:08.460]   I explained how I got the driver's licenses,
[04:25:08.460 --> 04:25:12.180]   how I made the bank statements,
[04:25:12.180 --> 04:25:13.500]   how I made the birth certificates,
[04:25:13.500 --> 04:25:16.180]   how I, the whole social engineering
[04:25:16.180 --> 04:25:19.620]   of figuring out how to, what these little loopholes are.
[04:25:19.620 --> 04:25:22.540]   It's like seven days total with these guys.
[04:25:22.540 --> 04:25:24.460]   So-- - You mean like questions?
[04:25:24.460 --> 04:25:26.980]   - Yeah, it was like they questioned me for all day
[04:25:26.980 --> 04:25:29.740]   and then they take me back to the Marshall's holdover
[04:25:29.740 --> 04:25:31.420]   and then the next morning I wake up
[04:25:31.420 --> 04:25:33.300]   and they chain me up again and bring me back.
[04:25:33.300 --> 04:25:34.140]   - What's that like?
[04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:36.260]   What's that process of questioning like?
[04:25:36.260 --> 04:25:38.540]   Are they, I mean, you're somebody
[04:25:38.540 --> 04:25:41.640]   who is exceptionally good at conversation.
[04:25:41.640 --> 04:25:47.180]   Charismatic, it was part of the games you played.
[04:25:47.180 --> 04:25:49.000]   Are they good at conversation?
[04:25:49.000 --> 04:25:51.720]   - I mean, they're, you know,
[04:25:51.720 --> 04:25:55.340]   the problem is they're not there to shoot the shit.
[04:25:55.340 --> 04:25:56.180]   You see what I'm saying?
[04:25:56.180 --> 04:25:57.820]   Like, they have an agenda.
[04:25:57.820 --> 04:25:59.620]   - But they have to use their words
[04:25:59.620 --> 04:26:01.460]   to get information out of you.
[04:26:01.460 --> 04:26:03.060]   Aren't they trying to manipulate you?
[04:26:03.060 --> 04:26:05.020]   - I'm not, I'm not holding anything back.
[04:26:05.020 --> 04:26:06.580]   - Okay.
[04:26:06.580 --> 04:26:09.580]   - I'm not, it's not like I'm sparing Jim.
[04:26:09.580 --> 04:26:11.860]   You know, trust me, Jim's gotta go.
[04:26:11.860 --> 04:26:14.860]   I mean, you're looking at, you're at 20 some odd years
[04:26:14.860 --> 04:26:19.300]   but Jim can do five, Bill can do some, Tom can do six.
[04:26:19.300 --> 04:26:22.020]   I don't even like, I don't even like Jerry.
[04:26:22.020 --> 04:26:25.820]   Jerry can do 20, you know, so I'm ready.
[04:26:25.820 --> 04:26:27.180]   I'm ready to cut everybody's throat.
[04:26:27.180 --> 04:26:29.220]   - But you're not guaranteed that you're not,
[04:26:29.220 --> 04:26:30.780]   you're getting anything for that.
[04:26:30.780 --> 04:26:32.020]   - Right.
[04:26:32.020 --> 04:26:34.980]   In all my time, I've seen one, one time
[04:26:34.980 --> 04:26:37.060]   where an inmate got a guarantee
[04:26:37.060 --> 04:26:39.340]   to have his sentence reduced.
[04:26:39.340 --> 04:26:42.020]   And it was signed by the head of the FBI.
[04:26:42.020 --> 04:26:43.660]   It was Robert Mueller, gave it to him
[04:26:43.660 --> 04:26:45.620]   to have a conversation with him.
[04:26:45.620 --> 04:26:48.420]   That's the only time I've ever seen that document.
[04:26:48.420 --> 04:26:50.660]   - Okay, so a lot of days
[04:26:50.660 --> 04:26:52.540]   with both the Secret Service and the FBI.
[04:26:52.540 --> 04:26:56.420]   - So FBI was, Candace was irritated, didn't like me.
[04:26:56.420 --> 04:26:59.260]   And I remember when I, she, I took the cuffs off.
[04:26:59.260 --> 04:27:00.300]   I was like rubbing my wrist.
[04:27:00.300 --> 04:27:01.140]   She goes, "Your wrist hurt?"
[04:27:01.140 --> 04:27:02.420]   And I go, "Yeah."
[04:27:02.420 --> 04:27:03.980]   And she goes, "Get used to it."
[04:27:03.980 --> 04:27:06.820]   I mean, she was just an asshole, just all around.
[04:27:06.820 --> 04:27:07.900]   Not that she didn't have a right to be,
[04:27:07.900 --> 04:27:10.620]   but everybody else was professional, you know?
[04:27:10.620 --> 04:27:13.340]   So. (laughs)
[04:27:13.340 --> 04:27:14.180]   - Oh, Candace.
[04:27:14.180 --> 04:27:18.780]   - So we, you know, we talked for three or four days
[04:27:18.780 --> 04:27:23.300]   with the FBI and, you know, they asked a ton of questions.
[04:27:23.300 --> 04:27:26.100]   They brought a ton of, they brought documents, you know?
[04:27:26.100 --> 04:27:27.380]   So it's like, "Hey, who signed this?"
[04:27:27.380 --> 04:27:29.220]   You know, it's like, "Oh, that's not my signature.
[04:27:29.220 --> 04:27:30.260]   "That's so-and-so's signature."
[04:27:30.260 --> 04:27:32.820]   Or, "I signed that, I signed that, I signed that.
[04:27:32.820 --> 04:27:33.660]   "That's so-and-so.
[04:27:33.660 --> 04:27:34.500]   "Where'd this check go?
[04:27:34.500 --> 04:27:35.320]   "Who is this?
[04:27:35.320 --> 04:27:36.160]   "Oh, that's so-and-so."
[04:27:36.160 --> 04:27:38.140]   You know, you're looking over everything.
[04:27:38.140 --> 04:27:40.260]   One of the things they wanted to know about was,
[04:27:40.260 --> 04:27:44.380]   which I never talked about 'cause it seems so minor,
[04:27:44.380 --> 04:27:46.020]   is I bribed a politician.
[04:27:46.020 --> 04:27:48.860]   I got him elected because we got him elected
[04:27:48.860 --> 04:27:53.860]   to the city council so he could vote to get the lots.
[04:27:53.860 --> 04:27:58.100]   We bought like 100 vacant lots in Ybor City.
[04:27:58.100 --> 04:27:59.780]   And I wanted 'em all, they were all single family.
[04:27:59.780 --> 04:28:02.000]   We wanted them zoned multifamily.
[04:28:02.000 --> 04:28:05.140]   And so we bribed him and got him elected.
[04:28:05.140 --> 04:28:06.980]   - That doesn't seem minor.
[04:28:06.980 --> 04:28:09.100]   - It's not as sexy as the rest of the stuff.
[04:28:09.100 --> 04:28:10.860]   - That's pretty, I mean--
[04:28:10.860 --> 04:28:12.900]   - So that's a whole 'nother thing.
[04:28:12.900 --> 04:28:14.380]   Like, I mean, you know.
[04:28:14.380 --> 04:28:19.380]   So what happened is when they got all of the bank accounts,
[04:28:19.380 --> 04:28:23.100]   they see all these checks going to Kevin White.
[04:28:23.100 --> 04:28:25.940]   And so they're like, "Why did James Redd
[04:28:25.940 --> 04:28:28.220]   "donate $500 to Kevin White?
[04:28:28.220 --> 04:28:29.860]   "Why did Brandon Green donate?
[04:28:29.860 --> 04:28:31.340]   "Why did Alan Duncan donate?
[04:28:31.340 --> 04:28:33.380]   "Why did," and so I had explained to him,
[04:28:33.380 --> 04:28:35.900]   "Oh yeah, well, we wanted him to be city councilman
[04:28:35.900 --> 04:28:38.320]   "so we paid, gave him a bunch of money
[04:28:38.320 --> 04:28:40.060]   "so he could run the ads, so he could get elected,
[04:28:40.060 --> 04:28:41.860]   "so he could then get all of our stuff."
[04:28:41.860 --> 04:28:45.340]   But because he never did, I took off on the run
[04:28:45.340 --> 04:28:46.900]   before he was able to do that.
[04:28:46.900 --> 04:28:51.740]   And then he ended up getting, not long,
[04:28:51.740 --> 04:28:53.620]   too, too long after that, he ended up,
[04:28:53.620 --> 04:28:56.540]   about five, six years later, he ended up getting
[04:28:56.540 --> 04:28:59.380]   indicted for bribery, but not mine,
[04:28:59.380 --> 04:29:00.820]   on somebody else's case.
[04:29:00.820 --> 04:29:02.260]   - Can I take a small tangent here
[04:29:02.260 --> 04:29:04.500]   and ask how many politicians do you think
[04:29:04.500 --> 04:29:08.620]   commit crimes are a little bit or a lot criminals?
[04:29:08.620 --> 04:29:12.260]   - I mean, I think there's some ways that are,
[04:29:12.260 --> 04:29:15.660]   they're seemingly legal.
[04:29:15.660 --> 04:29:17.540]   - The aforementioned gray area.
[04:29:17.540 --> 04:29:18.660]   - Well, that's not gray.
[04:29:18.660 --> 04:29:22.260]   Like, this guy was, at one point,
[04:29:22.260 --> 04:29:25.300]   I couldn't find anybody to write $500 checks anymore,
[04:29:25.300 --> 04:29:26.500]   so I just gave him cash.
[04:29:26.500 --> 04:29:30.700]   Like, I'm just handing him seven, $8,000, $10,000 in cash.
[04:29:30.700 --> 04:29:35.700]   So, but I think most of them have legal ways
[04:29:35.700 --> 04:29:41.660]   to make ungodly amounts of money for influence.
[04:29:41.660 --> 04:29:44.820]   But is it legal?
[04:29:44.820 --> 04:29:46.260]   No, it's their politicians, they've made it
[04:29:46.260 --> 04:29:48.300]   so that it's not illegal.
[04:29:48.300 --> 04:29:51.000]   If you really sat down and explained it to someone,
[04:29:53.740 --> 04:29:56.460]   the average person would say, "That's not right.
[04:29:56.460 --> 04:29:58.100]   "Oh, no, no, that's legal."
[04:29:58.100 --> 04:30:01.040]   - So, okay, so at the end of these few days,
[04:30:01.040 --> 04:30:05.140]   what was the sentencing like?
[04:30:05.140 --> 04:30:08.060]   - Yeah, I end up, I go to sentencing.
[04:30:08.060 --> 04:30:12.660]   I get my PSI back, and it's 32 years to life.
[04:30:12.660 --> 04:30:17.660]   And so, we argue about it with the prosecutor
[04:30:17.660 --> 04:30:21.740]   just before sentencing, and they get it down
[04:30:21.740 --> 04:30:24.300]   to 26 years, four months.
[04:30:24.300 --> 04:30:30.660]   And then Millie says, "Listen, don't worry,"
[04:30:30.660 --> 04:30:32.260]   'cause I'm trying to backpedal at this point.
[04:30:32.260 --> 04:30:34.300]   I'm like, I might as well go to trial.
[04:30:34.300 --> 04:30:36.940]   If I lost at trial, I couldn't get more than 30.
[04:30:36.940 --> 04:30:39.580]   That you can't, well, more than 32 years,
[04:30:39.580 --> 04:30:40.640]   'cause you can't get life.
[04:30:40.640 --> 04:30:42.420]   32 was the max, it's just a mistake.
[04:30:42.420 --> 04:30:44.160]   He said 32 years to life, you can't get life.
[04:30:44.160 --> 04:30:46.100]   So, it was like, the most I can get is 32 years.
[04:30:46.100 --> 04:30:47.060]   So, I was like, I'll go to trial.
[04:30:47.060 --> 04:30:49.460]   Might as well go to trial and see if I can get them
[04:30:49.460 --> 04:30:51.400]   to reduce some of these enhancements.
[04:30:51.400 --> 04:30:55.060]   She insists that she can get the enhancements knocked out.
[04:30:55.060 --> 04:30:57.520]   And if you read, they actually read the enhancements.
[04:30:57.520 --> 04:31:00.020]   Some of the enhancements, they didn't apply to me.
[04:31:00.020 --> 04:31:04.060]   So, she goes, and I believed her,
[04:31:04.060 --> 04:31:06.460]   and I think she made a valid argument.
[04:31:06.460 --> 04:31:09.780]   We go to sentencing, my mom's there, she's crying.
[04:31:09.780 --> 04:31:13.660]   My dad's there, he's looking at me like he's disgusted.
[04:31:13.660 --> 04:31:17.980]   And crowd, there's a whole bunch of reporters,
[04:31:17.980 --> 04:31:19.540]   like the whole place is packed.
[04:31:20.620 --> 04:31:22.120]   And I plead guilty.
[04:31:22.120 --> 04:31:23.960]   Millie gets up, my lawyer gets up,
[04:31:23.960 --> 04:31:26.680]   and she argues these enhancements.
[04:31:26.680 --> 04:31:29.000]   And every single time, the judge is like,
[04:31:29.000 --> 04:31:33.640]   I disagree, overruled.
[04:31:33.640 --> 04:31:36.140]   And it's like, boom, five more years.
[04:31:36.140 --> 04:31:40.240]   Bam, six more years, bam.
[04:31:40.240 --> 04:31:42.320]   'Cause if she had won the enhancements she argued,
[04:31:42.320 --> 04:31:43.620]   I would've got 14 years.
[04:31:43.620 --> 04:31:48.280]   Now, keep in mind too, prior to this,
[04:31:48.280 --> 04:31:50.320]   a month or two prior to this,
[04:31:50.320 --> 04:31:55.200]   the US attorney had called Millie and said,
[04:31:55.200 --> 04:31:58.400]   look, Dateline, Dateline had already come out, by the way.
[04:31:58.400 --> 04:31:59.760]   Remember, I was worried about Dateline coming out.
[04:31:59.760 --> 04:32:01.560]   Well, it had come out.
[04:32:01.560 --> 04:32:03.840]   But they wanted to do a follow-up,
[04:32:03.840 --> 04:32:07.440]   because it came out a month or two after I got arrested.
[04:32:07.440 --> 04:32:08.960]   And they were saying, hey, we wanna recut it
[04:32:08.960 --> 04:32:10.760]   with interviews with him.
[04:32:10.760 --> 04:32:14.600]   Well, Gayle McKenzie, that's the US attorney,
[04:32:14.600 --> 04:32:15.840]   she wants me to do that.
[04:32:15.840 --> 04:32:20.220]   And she says, I'll consider that substantial assistance.
[04:32:20.220 --> 04:32:23.260]   Now, when you cooperate with the government,
[04:32:23.260 --> 04:32:25.560]   they consider it substantial assistance,
[04:32:25.560 --> 04:32:26.800]   that's what they call it.
[04:32:26.800 --> 04:32:29.120]   So I cooperate with you, it's substantial assistance.
[04:32:29.120 --> 04:32:31.840]   She says, if he's interviewed by Dateline,
[04:32:31.840 --> 04:32:34.920]   we'll consider it substantial assistance.
[04:32:34.920 --> 04:32:36.920]   And Millie says, you have to do it.
[04:32:36.920 --> 04:32:38.320]   - By the way, what's the idea behind that,
[04:32:38.320 --> 04:32:41.320]   that you serve as a warning for others
[04:32:41.320 --> 04:32:42.160]   or something like that?
[04:32:42.160 --> 04:32:45.840]   - Yeah, exactly, it's a, you become a cautionary tale,
[04:32:45.840 --> 04:32:47.640]   like, don't let this happen to you.
[04:32:47.640 --> 04:32:50.800]   So I go, and I'm interviewed by Dateline.
[04:32:50.800 --> 04:32:55.320]   Keith Morris, or whatever his name is, that guy.
[04:32:55.320 --> 04:32:57.660]   Mr. Coxworth, that guy.
[04:32:57.660 --> 04:33:01.680]   So he comes, and he interviews me.
[04:33:01.680 --> 04:33:05.080]   Becky's interviewed, I'm interviewed, Amanda's interviewed,
[04:33:05.080 --> 04:33:08.520]   Allison is interviewed, everybody,
[04:33:08.520 --> 04:33:10.920]   the Secret Service agent, I think, is interviewed,
[04:33:10.920 --> 04:33:12.720]   everybody, prosecutor's interviewed.
[04:33:15.240 --> 04:33:18.600]   It's funny, at the time, I was, when I watched it,
[04:33:18.600 --> 04:33:21.600]   I was like, that's not true, that's not true,
[04:33:21.600 --> 04:33:25.360]   and that, and it honestly was like 99% true.
[04:33:25.360 --> 04:33:28.280]   It's, like, looking back on it, you know,
[04:33:28.280 --> 04:33:32.480]   I'm like, you know, like, my Audi TT wasn't blue,
[04:33:32.480 --> 04:33:35.980]   it was silver, you know, it's just stupid.
[04:33:35.980 --> 04:33:38.000]   But anyway, so I'm interviewed by them,
[04:33:38.000 --> 04:33:40.440]   and they recut it and they air the video.
[04:33:40.440 --> 04:33:44.280]   So you said this was substantial assistance.
[04:33:44.280 --> 04:33:45.720]   And then the other thing is, I was interviewed
[04:33:45.720 --> 04:33:47.800]   by the FBI and the Secret Service.
[04:33:47.800 --> 04:33:52.120]   Now, my lawyer calls the prosecutor
[04:33:52.120 --> 04:33:54.080]   the night before sentencing, and says,
[04:33:54.080 --> 04:33:56.400]   "Look, he was interviewed by Dateline,
[04:33:56.400 --> 04:33:59.860]   "and he was interviewed by the Secret Service and the FBI.
[04:33:59.860 --> 04:34:04.540]   "And if you do that, you said you'd reduce his sentence.
[04:34:04.540 --> 04:34:06.220]   "You'd consider it substantial assistance,
[04:34:06.220 --> 04:34:07.940]   "and you would reduce his sentence.
[04:34:07.940 --> 04:34:11.200]   "What are you going to ask for his sentence
[04:34:11.200 --> 04:34:13.240]   "to be tomorrow at sentencing?"
[04:34:13.240 --> 04:34:17.140]   And she said, "We did consider it substantial assistance,
[04:34:17.140 --> 04:34:18.680]   "and it's just not enough."
[04:34:18.680 --> 04:34:20.400]   What do you mean?
[04:34:20.400 --> 04:34:22.000]   Nobody was arrested.
[04:34:22.000 --> 04:34:23.860]   Yes, but what about Dateline?
[04:34:23.860 --> 04:34:26.640]   Millie, I don't know what to tell you,
[04:34:26.640 --> 04:34:27.820]   it just wasn't enough.
[04:34:27.820 --> 04:34:29.320]   - We considered it?
[04:34:29.320 --> 04:34:30.440]   - We considered it.
[04:34:30.440 --> 04:34:33.180]   We will consider it, and they did consider it.
[04:34:33.180 --> 04:34:34.560]   So-- - Oh, man.
[04:34:34.560 --> 04:34:37.720]   - Yeah, that's like, you have to really, you know,
[04:34:37.720 --> 04:34:40.040]   the meaning of words is so important.
[04:34:40.040 --> 04:34:41.440]   - I'm gonna use that at some point.
[04:34:41.680 --> 04:34:42.520]   I'll consider it. - I will consider it.
[04:34:42.520 --> 04:34:43.340]   I'll consider it.
[04:34:43.340 --> 04:34:44.680]   I considered it.
[04:34:44.680 --> 04:34:46.220]   - It's not.
[04:34:46.220 --> 04:34:48.800]   So-- - And still feel the same.
[04:34:48.800 --> 04:34:50.960]   - So she calls me, "I'm crushed."
[04:34:50.960 --> 04:34:52.100]   And she's like, "But look, you know,
[04:34:52.100 --> 04:34:53.120]   "they're still investigating.
[04:34:53.120 --> 04:34:54.560]   "They're gonna make these arrests."
[04:34:54.560 --> 04:34:57.580]   And so when you get a sentence reduction at sentencing,
[04:34:57.580 --> 04:34:59.060]   it's called a 5K1.
[04:34:59.060 --> 04:35:03.480]   When you get a sentence reduction after sentencing,
[04:35:03.480 --> 04:35:05.800]   it's called a Rule 35.
[04:35:05.800 --> 04:35:07.340]   So she said, "We'll file a Rule 35
[04:35:07.340 --> 04:35:09.160]   "as soon as the arrests are made."
[04:35:09.160 --> 04:35:10.120]   Okay.
[04:35:10.120 --> 04:35:12.060]   So I go to sentencing, and Millie says,
[04:35:12.060 --> 04:35:12.920]   "You're gonna get 14 years.
[04:35:12.920 --> 04:35:14.480]   "I'm gonna argue these enhancements."
[04:35:14.480 --> 04:35:16.560]   She argues the enhancements.
[04:35:16.560 --> 04:35:18.620]   She loses the enhancements.
[04:35:18.620 --> 04:35:20.080]   Not that she's not an amazing attorney.
[04:35:20.080 --> 04:35:21.840]   She's an amazing attorney.
[04:35:21.840 --> 04:35:24.280]   The judge wanted to hammer me.
[04:35:24.280 --> 04:35:25.240]   He hammered me.
[04:35:25.240 --> 04:35:28.420]   You know, Millie was a great attorney.
[04:35:28.420 --> 04:35:30.160]   She was always polite to me.
[04:35:30.160 --> 04:35:31.360]   And by the way, to this day,
[04:35:31.360 --> 04:35:32.520]   we'll answer my phone call.
[04:35:32.520 --> 04:35:35.700]   Most public defenders, you call them now,
[04:35:35.700 --> 04:35:37.120]   you call them after your sentence,
[04:35:37.120 --> 04:35:38.560]   they don't answer your call.
[04:35:39.840 --> 04:35:40.800]   Great person.
[04:35:40.800 --> 04:35:42.540]   - Thank you, Millie.
[04:35:42.540 --> 04:35:45.400]   - I didn't give her anything to work with.
[04:35:45.400 --> 04:35:47.800]   You know, it's like, I'm overwhelmingly guilty.
[04:35:47.800 --> 04:35:50.160]   It's like, there's no defense.
[04:35:50.160 --> 04:35:53.680]   So I end up getting sentenced 26 years.
[04:35:53.680 --> 04:35:56.880]   That's a lot of years.
[04:35:56.880 --> 04:36:01.880]   I would like to tell you that when they gave me the time,
[04:36:01.880 --> 04:36:04.960]   you know, that I was stoic, and I stood there,
[04:36:04.960 --> 04:36:07.840]   and I took it in.
[04:36:07.840 --> 04:36:09.940]   You know, but the truth is, I cried like a baby,
[04:36:09.940 --> 04:36:11.040]   like a small child.
[04:36:11.040 --> 04:36:15.240]   Like, you've never seen anyone cry like this in your life.
[04:36:15.240 --> 04:36:19.760]   I was just, how did I get 26?
[04:36:19.760 --> 04:36:21.600]   What did I do to get 26 years?
[04:36:21.600 --> 04:36:24.000]   Like, murderers, rapists.
[04:36:24.000 --> 04:36:27.620]   I've met guys that kidnapped guys that got 15.
[04:36:27.620 --> 04:36:31.360]   - 26.
[04:36:31.360 --> 04:36:33.520]   - So yeah, I--
[04:36:33.520 --> 04:36:34.420]   - Were you scared?
[04:36:35.860 --> 04:36:38.540]   - I mean, you know, does the Pope wear a funny hat?
[04:36:38.540 --> 04:36:41.040]   Like, of course I was scared, I was terrified.
[04:36:41.040 --> 04:36:44.100]   I mean, you know, but I kept telling myself,
[04:36:44.100 --> 04:36:45.780]   ah, they're gonna reduce the sentence,
[04:36:45.780 --> 04:36:47.540]   they'll reduce it, they'll reduce it, they'll reduce it.
[04:36:47.540 --> 04:36:49.460]   Like, okay, okay, okay, it's gonna be okay,
[04:36:49.460 --> 04:36:50.420]   it's gonna be okay.
[04:36:50.420 --> 04:36:52.660]   You know, but it wasn't okay.
[04:36:52.660 --> 04:36:57.660]   I got moved to Coleman, the Coleman Complex
[04:36:57.660 --> 04:37:02.100]   in Coleman, Florida, the Federal Correctional
[04:37:02.100 --> 04:37:04.580]   Coleman Complex in Coleman, Florida,
[04:37:04.580 --> 04:37:07.420]   which is the largest complex in the nation,
[04:37:07.420 --> 04:37:08.900]   federal complex in the nation.
[04:37:08.900 --> 04:37:13.900]   At that time, there was a camp, which was a female camp.
[04:37:13.900 --> 04:37:19.460]   There was a low-security prison for men,
[04:37:19.460 --> 04:37:22.280]   a medium-security prison, and two penitentiaries.
[04:37:22.280 --> 04:37:26.460]   And so I get moved to the medium.
[04:37:26.460 --> 04:37:28.260]   Now, I'm moved to the medium not because,
[04:37:28.260 --> 04:37:30.180]   like, that's where, like, real criminals go, right?
[04:37:30.180 --> 04:37:33.580]   Like, I'm a soft white boy.
[04:37:33.580 --> 04:37:34.900]   Like, I'm no danger to anybody.
[04:37:34.900 --> 04:37:37.140]   Like, I hurt someone's feelings once.
[04:37:37.140 --> 04:37:40.980]   But other than that, I'm not gonna be a problem.
[04:37:40.980 --> 04:37:45.440]   But if you have more than 20 years to serve,
[04:37:45.440 --> 04:37:46.940]   you have to go to a medium.
[04:37:46.940 --> 04:37:48.700]   So even though my security level said
[04:37:48.700 --> 04:37:53.560]   this guy should be in a camp, I had 20 years.
[04:37:53.560 --> 04:37:55.460]   So if you have, you can't go to a camp
[04:37:55.460 --> 04:37:57.020]   till you have less than 10.
[04:37:57.020 --> 04:38:00.420]   So as soon as I am given 26 years,
[04:38:00.420 --> 04:38:02.460]   they knock off three, but you still have three years
[04:38:02.460 --> 04:38:04.100]   to get below 20, so they go to the medium.
[04:38:04.100 --> 04:38:06.780]   So I go to the medium, and there are guys getting stabbed.
[04:38:06.780 --> 04:38:08.940]   The very first day, people are being stabbed.
[04:38:08.940 --> 04:38:13.140]   I get locked into, go to my cell, meet my cellie.
[04:38:13.140 --> 04:38:15.060]   They scream lockdown.
[04:38:15.060 --> 04:38:17.260]   Somebody got stabbed in the rec yard.
[04:38:17.260 --> 04:38:18.580]   I remember I asked my cellie,
[04:38:18.580 --> 04:38:20.620]   which I met 20 minutes earlier, I was like,
[04:38:20.620 --> 04:38:21.460]   what's, you know, he's like,
[04:38:21.460 --> 04:38:22.580]   "Hey, we gotta get in the cell."
[04:38:22.580 --> 04:38:23.580]   I was like, "What's going on?"
[04:38:23.580 --> 04:38:24.780]   He goes, "Somebody got stabbed in the yard."
[04:38:24.780 --> 04:38:26.540]   I go, "Somebody just got killed?"
[04:38:26.540 --> 04:38:29.060]   And he goes, "Nah, they just stabbed him up a little bit."
[04:38:29.060 --> 04:38:31.860]   And I thought, you're in a place
[04:38:31.860 --> 04:38:33.820]   where they stabbed him up a little bit.
[04:38:33.820 --> 04:38:35.900]   Like, you're not prepared for this, bro.
[04:38:35.900 --> 04:38:37.820]   You gotta get out of here.
[04:38:37.820 --> 04:38:40.420]   So anyway, I go to the medium, I'm there.
[04:38:40.420 --> 04:38:42.180]   - Like, what was the first day and night?
[04:38:42.180 --> 04:38:44.180]   - When I remember, I already had been locked up
[04:38:44.180 --> 04:38:46.300]   in the county, and they're county jails,
[04:38:46.300 --> 04:38:48.460]   where they call them US, they're US Marshal,
[04:38:48.460 --> 04:38:51.020]   they're holdovers, but they're really county jails.
[04:38:51.020 --> 04:38:54.940]   They just keep you with the federal guys.
[04:38:54.940 --> 04:38:58.100]   So I'm not mixed in with hobos and people like that.
[04:38:58.100 --> 04:39:00.100]   Like, I'm mixed in with the federal people.
[04:39:00.100 --> 04:39:02.900]   - So it already felt like a prison?
[04:39:02.900 --> 04:39:04.460]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a prison.
[04:39:04.460 --> 04:39:07.740]   I mean, it's jail, but it's a prison,
[04:39:07.740 --> 04:39:09.100]   and unless you've been locked up,
[04:39:09.100 --> 04:39:10.060]   you don't really know the difference.
[04:39:10.060 --> 04:39:11.860]   So it's a jail.
[04:39:11.860 --> 04:39:13.340]   Jails suck, jails are much worse.
[04:39:13.340 --> 04:39:15.680]   The whole time I was locked up in the jails,
[04:39:15.680 --> 04:39:17.100]   waiting to be sentenced, guys were like,
[04:39:17.100 --> 04:39:19.420]   "I just wanna get sentenced and go to prison, bro."
[04:39:19.420 --> 04:39:22.420]   And I was like, "Why does everybody keep saying that?"
[04:39:22.420 --> 04:39:24.300]   Like, prison's worse than this, bro.
[04:39:24.300 --> 04:39:26.820]   Like, I saw Shawshank, like, it's horrible.
[04:39:26.820 --> 04:39:29.900]   And they're like, "Bro, prison, listen, prison,
[04:39:29.900 --> 04:39:33.020]   I can walk the rec yard, I could go to the movie room,
[04:39:33.020 --> 04:39:36.980]   watch movies, listen, within, right after count,"
[04:39:36.980 --> 04:39:39.720]   for this four o'clock count, they count everybody at four.
[04:39:39.720 --> 04:39:42.020]   So they are like, "Right after count,
[04:39:42.020 --> 04:39:43.060]   I'm gonna go to commissary,
[04:39:43.060 --> 04:39:44.540]   somebody's gonna buy me an ice cream.
[04:39:44.540 --> 04:39:45.820]   I'm gonna be eating an ice cream,
[04:39:45.820 --> 04:39:49.140]   walking on the rec yard the first day."
[04:39:49.140 --> 04:39:51.380]   Like, and I'm, you know, it's been months and months
[04:39:51.380 --> 04:39:53.580]   and months that I've been locked up in this county jail,
[04:39:53.580 --> 04:39:54.860]   and I'm thinking, "I wanna go to prison.
[04:39:54.860 --> 04:39:57.340]   Like, that sounds nice, I'd like an ice cream."
[04:39:57.340 --> 04:40:00.000]   - Yeah, but there was a stabbing on the first day.
[04:40:00.000 --> 04:40:01.740]   - Yeah, well, everybody kept telling me
[04:40:01.740 --> 04:40:02.940]   I was gonna go to a camp.
[04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:05.020]   You're gonna go to a camp, you're gonna go to a low.
[04:40:05.020 --> 04:40:05.860]   - I see.
[04:40:05.860 --> 04:40:07.860]   - You know, and honestly, I was, very quickly,
[04:40:07.860 --> 04:40:09.500]   I was walking on the rec yard.
[04:40:09.500 --> 04:40:14.160]   I was, you know, so I was at the medium, I got there.
[04:40:14.160 --> 04:40:19.680]   You know, it's a real prison with the doors, bam,
[04:40:19.680 --> 04:40:21.420]   and you can open the little tray thing
[04:40:21.420 --> 04:40:22.500]   and feed you out of the tray,
[04:40:22.500 --> 04:40:25.240]   and there's a stainless steel toilet and sink,
[04:40:25.240 --> 04:40:26.860]   and, you know, they have that in the county, too.
[04:40:26.860 --> 04:40:29.100]   But, you know, it's exactly
[04:40:29.100 --> 04:40:30.980]   what you think of prison as being.
[04:40:30.980 --> 04:40:33.740]   - But it feels like a fundamentally different experience
[04:40:33.740 --> 04:40:36.740]   when it's 26 years, and the door locks, and--
[04:40:36.740 --> 04:40:39.400]   - Yeah, so, yeah, I have a cellie,
[04:40:39.400 --> 04:40:43.820]   and, but I'm also, they sent me to a prison
[04:40:43.820 --> 04:40:47.300]   where guys have, tons of guys have 30, 40, 50 years,
[04:40:47.300 --> 04:40:48.420]   you know, life sentences.
[04:40:48.420 --> 04:40:52.620]   There's gangsters there, there's murderers,
[04:40:52.620 --> 04:40:56.900]   there's serial killers, there's, you know, really bad guys.
[04:40:56.900 --> 04:41:01.820]   There's, you know, there's guys that are, you know,
[04:41:01.820 --> 04:41:06.500]   trying to take advantage of guys, right?
[04:41:06.500 --> 04:41:07.860]   - Yeah, sexually? - Yeah.
[04:41:07.860 --> 04:41:13.140]   But by the time I got there, I'd heard all the, you know,
[04:41:13.140 --> 04:41:15.220]   how you can get yourself in trouble.
[04:41:15.220 --> 04:41:16.120]   You know, how you can, like,
[04:41:16.120 --> 04:41:17.940]   don't go in somebody else's cell.
[04:41:17.940 --> 04:41:20.760]   You don't know the guy, you're not 100% sure,
[04:41:20.760 --> 04:41:22.020]   do not go in his cell.
[04:41:22.020 --> 04:41:23.740]   Don't even go near his cell.
[04:41:23.740 --> 04:41:26.700]   Don't go into places where people can close a door
[04:41:26.700 --> 04:41:29.060]   behind you, or they can trap you in an area.
[04:41:29.060 --> 04:41:30.820]   Don't, you know, there's all these things
[04:41:30.820 --> 04:41:33.980]   that I've been told not to do.
[04:41:33.980 --> 04:41:35.380]   - Again, for sexual reasons.
[04:41:35.380 --> 04:41:40.380]   - Right, because I'm a small guy in prison, you know?
[04:41:40.380 --> 04:41:43.380]   - Tracked away, dude.
[04:41:43.380 --> 04:41:45.340]   - Yeah, it's a problem, it's a problem.
[04:41:45.340 --> 04:41:49.660]   This, it's bad, it's all bad.
[04:41:49.660 --> 04:41:51.780]   - Well, it's good in the outside world,
[04:41:51.780 --> 04:41:53.340]   but bad in prison.
[04:41:53.340 --> 04:41:55.220]   - You know, yeah, my fear was there,
[04:41:55.220 --> 04:41:56.740]   make me shave my head to make sure
[04:41:56.740 --> 04:42:00.020]   that the mop wig fits correctly.
[04:42:00.020 --> 04:42:01.100]   But there's certain things that,
[04:42:01.100 --> 04:42:01.940]   I always hate to say this,
[04:42:01.940 --> 04:42:04.220]   but I mean, this is the simplest way to say it,
[04:42:04.220 --> 04:42:08.460]   is that if you get stabbed in prison, you had it coming.
[04:42:08.460 --> 04:42:10.860]   You did something.
[04:42:10.860 --> 04:42:12.580]   Like, they're not running around just stabbing people.
[04:42:12.580 --> 04:42:13.580]   You did something.
[04:42:13.580 --> 04:42:16.080]   You, and the things that get you hurt
[04:42:16.080 --> 04:42:20.660]   is you argue over the TV, what channel you wanna watch.
[04:42:20.660 --> 04:42:24.300]   You got 50, 80 guys watching one TV.
[04:42:24.300 --> 04:42:25.140]   Don't argue about it.
[04:42:25.140 --> 04:42:26.520]   Like, it's not worth it.
[04:42:26.520 --> 04:42:31.860]   Borrowing things and not returning them, that's a problem.
[04:42:31.860 --> 04:42:34.500]   Running up debts, that's a big problem.
[04:42:34.500 --> 04:42:37.940]   You know, gambling, gossiping.
[04:42:37.940 --> 04:42:38.940]   You know, those are the problem.
[04:42:38.940 --> 04:42:40.360]   Those things get you hurt.
[04:42:40.360 --> 04:42:42.020]   Not being polite, be respectful.
[04:42:42.020 --> 04:42:43.900]   I'm super respectful.
[04:42:43.900 --> 04:42:48.900]   So, I was respectful very quickly when I got to Coleman.
[04:42:50.260 --> 04:42:52.340]   There are continuing education courses.
[04:42:52.340 --> 04:42:55.940]   One of the courses is residential real estate.
[04:42:55.940 --> 04:42:59.620]   The guy that was running the residential real estate
[04:42:59.620 --> 04:43:02.940]   didn't wanna do it anymore because he was doing legal work
[04:43:02.940 --> 04:43:04.840]   and it just was taking too much time.
[04:43:04.840 --> 04:43:07.300]   So, he came to me and said, "Listen, you just got here.
[04:43:07.300 --> 04:43:09.580]   "You got a real estate background like nobody else does.
[04:43:09.580 --> 04:43:10.660]   "Can you take over this class?"
[04:43:10.660 --> 04:43:12.020]   And I was like, "Um, sure."
[04:43:12.020 --> 04:43:13.180]   So, I looked at his curriculum.
[04:43:13.180 --> 04:43:14.820]   I kinda rewrote it a little bit.
[04:43:14.820 --> 04:43:16.660]   And I started teaching the residential real estate class.
[04:43:16.660 --> 04:43:18.740]   And at one point, I was teaching two classes,
[04:43:18.740 --> 04:43:20.800]   like a semester or a quarter.
[04:43:20.800 --> 04:43:23.500]   And these guys loved it.
[04:43:23.500 --> 04:43:26.240]   Like, they all think they're gonna get out and flip houses.
[04:43:26.240 --> 04:43:28.180]   So, I started, you know, from the fundamentals.
[04:43:28.180 --> 04:43:31.460]   I talk about credit, how to borrow, how hard money lenders,
[04:43:31.460 --> 04:43:33.660]   different types of bar, like everything.
[04:43:33.660 --> 04:43:35.220]   And, you know, guys are walking.
[04:43:35.220 --> 04:43:37.580]   It's the first time in my life, this was funny.
[04:43:37.580 --> 04:43:39.340]   Not that I think I was really ever in a position
[04:43:39.340 --> 04:43:40.180]   for this to happen.
[04:43:40.180 --> 04:43:41.700]   This was really odd, though.
[04:43:41.700 --> 04:43:44.820]   Probably the second or third class, when guys are leaving
[04:43:44.820 --> 04:43:47.820]   and I'm having to check 'em off the roll,
[04:43:47.820 --> 04:43:49.660]   multiple guys are stopping and saying,
[04:43:49.660 --> 04:43:52.020]   "Yo, bro," putting their hand out, shaking my hand
[04:43:52.020 --> 04:43:53.660]   and going, "Good class.
[04:43:53.660 --> 04:43:55.500]   "It was a good class, bro."
[04:43:55.500 --> 04:43:57.740]   Then I have guys coming to me, telling me,
[04:43:57.740 --> 04:44:00.740]   "Hey, what are you teaching these guys?"
[04:44:00.740 --> 04:44:01.580]   I go, "What do you mean?"
[04:44:01.580 --> 04:44:03.120]   He goes, "My cell is telling me he's gonna get out
[04:44:03.120 --> 04:44:04.160]   "and make millions.
[04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:06.260]   "I'm taking Cox's real estate class.
[04:44:06.260 --> 04:44:07.160]   "I'm telling you, I can do this.
[04:44:07.160 --> 04:44:08.660]   "I'm gonna be a millionaire."
[04:44:08.660 --> 04:44:12.060]   And it's like, this flipping houses, like, this is not.
[04:44:12.060 --> 04:44:14.300]   But the truth is, if, you know, it is the,
[04:44:15.820 --> 04:44:19.660]   flipping houses was what I basically told these guys,
[04:44:19.660 --> 04:44:21.860]   especially the drug dealers, right?
[04:44:21.860 --> 04:44:24.020]   You're a drug dealer and you were raised in the projects
[04:44:24.020 --> 04:44:25.180]   and you're going back to the projects.
[04:44:25.180 --> 04:44:30.180]   Like, this is the one industry that you will thrive at
[04:44:30.180 --> 04:44:34.280]   because you're a hustler.
[04:44:34.280 --> 04:44:35.420]   You're not afraid.
[04:44:35.420 --> 04:44:39.540]   A 45-year-old divorced white woman is not going into the hood
[04:44:39.540 --> 04:44:42.940]   knocking on doors to try and flip houses, but you will.
[04:44:42.940 --> 04:44:44.220]   And you know everybody in the neighborhood
[04:44:44.220 --> 04:44:45.420]   and you'll knock on those doors
[04:44:45.420 --> 04:44:47.780]   and you'll hustle and you've been told no before
[04:44:47.780 --> 04:44:49.900]   and you don't care and you're not scared.
[04:44:49.900 --> 04:44:53.460]   And there's tons of money to be made in lower income areas.
[04:44:53.460 --> 04:44:55.820]   And so I, and then when I go through the whole thing
[04:44:55.820 --> 04:44:59.780]   and how you can leverage your credit to borrow money,
[04:44:59.780 --> 04:45:02.540]   to get into the property and do the renovations
[04:45:02.540 --> 04:45:05.140]   with very little money down and I do the whole thing,
[04:45:05.140 --> 04:45:06.300]   these guys, like, they loved it.
[04:45:06.300 --> 04:45:09.860]   So I was, and what that did for me was two things.
[04:45:09.860 --> 04:45:11.460]   One, if you got to the class,
[04:45:11.460 --> 04:45:12.980]   40 guys show up for the class and I say,
[04:45:12.980 --> 04:45:14.520]   "Look, if you don't wanna go, you don't wanna be here,
[04:45:14.520 --> 04:45:16.500]   "you just want it 'cause your counselor's
[04:45:16.500 --> 04:45:18.060]   "making you get a certificate,
[04:45:18.060 --> 04:45:20.040]   "you don't wanna be here, that's fine.
[04:45:20.040 --> 04:45:23.140]   "Bring me two coffees and like two creamers
[04:45:23.140 --> 04:45:26.460]   "from commissary and I'll fill out all your paperwork
[04:45:26.460 --> 04:45:28.820]   "and you'll pass, you'll get a certificate.
[04:45:28.820 --> 04:45:30.980]   "I don't have to see you again."
[04:45:30.980 --> 04:45:33.380]   I have full of coffee and creamer
[04:45:33.380 --> 04:45:35.820]   'cause at least 10 or 15 didn't wanna be there.
[04:45:35.820 --> 04:45:37.380]   The other guys seriously wanted to be there
[04:45:37.380 --> 04:45:38.620]   and I don't want those guys to be there anyway,
[04:45:38.620 --> 04:45:40.140]   they're gonna be a problem.
[04:45:40.140 --> 04:45:41.860]   So the other guys are serious about it
[04:45:41.860 --> 04:45:43.460]   and some of these guys sat through the class
[04:45:43.460 --> 04:45:44.940]   two, three, four times.
[04:45:44.940 --> 04:45:48.300]   Some of these guys got out and sent me money.
[04:45:48.300 --> 04:45:53.940]   You know, which is like a huge sign of respect,
[04:45:53.940 --> 04:45:57.540]   you know, by the way, 'cause they don't owe me anything.
[04:45:57.540 --> 04:45:59.700]   But I did that and I taught GED
[04:45:59.700 --> 04:46:04.740]   because, you know, you have to do something for money.
[04:46:04.740 --> 04:46:07.620]   And, you know, I met a bunch of cool guys
[04:46:07.620 --> 04:46:09.900]   and I was hanging out and I was doing well
[04:46:09.900 --> 04:46:14.900]   and after about three years they transferred me
[04:46:14.900 --> 04:46:19.580]   to the low security prison.
[04:46:19.580 --> 04:46:24.460]   At this point, like the FBI starts showing up
[04:46:24.460 --> 04:46:26.020]   asking me questions.
[04:46:26.020 --> 04:46:29.020]   They asked me questions about the politician I bribed,
[04:46:29.020 --> 04:46:31.020]   you know, asked me questions about him.
[04:46:31.020 --> 04:46:32.140]   Statutory limitations was up
[04:46:32.140 --> 04:46:36.220]   and they were trying to tie him into the bank fraud
[04:46:36.220 --> 04:46:38.100]   'cause his name was Kevin White
[04:46:38.100 --> 04:46:41.660]   and one of my guy's name was Michael Kevin White.
[04:46:41.660 --> 04:46:44.820]   And so they were trying to tie him in, you know,
[04:46:44.820 --> 04:46:46.220]   did he know about it?
[04:46:46.220 --> 04:46:47.620]   'Cause if he knew about it,
[04:46:47.620 --> 04:46:49.580]   statute of limitations is 10 years.
[04:46:49.580 --> 04:46:51.160]   We could, no, he didn't know.
[04:46:51.160 --> 04:46:54.620]   Should have thrown him in there.
[04:46:54.620 --> 04:46:56.260]   But anyway, 'cause like a couple years later
[04:46:56.260 --> 04:46:58.100]   he gets indicted, he ends up going to jail anyway.
[04:46:58.100 --> 04:47:00.220]   - It could have decreased your sentence.
[04:47:00.220 --> 04:47:03.600]   - Yeah, listen, listen, stop, stop.
[04:47:03.600 --> 04:47:07.140]   Oh my God.
[04:47:07.140 --> 04:47:10.500]   I got all my judgment out after the homeless conversation.
[04:47:10.500 --> 04:47:14.060]   - Listen, it's only gonna get worse.
[04:47:14.060 --> 04:47:16.860]   - I mean, I really appreciate your honesty
[04:47:16.860 --> 04:47:20.800]   and your insight about like about snitching, honestly,
[04:47:20.800 --> 04:47:25.800]   that I have a sense that there's at least a desire
[04:47:25.800 --> 04:47:27.640]   for loyalty in the world.
[04:47:27.640 --> 04:47:30.100]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[04:47:30.100 --> 04:47:34.860]   - Did you ever feel in danger and medium or low?
[04:47:36.900 --> 04:47:40.660]   - It's funny, I had more problems at the,
[04:47:40.660 --> 04:47:43.580]   probably at the low than I did the medium.
[04:47:43.580 --> 04:47:48.380]   But at the medium, the only thing that happened was
[04:47:48.380 --> 04:47:52.700]   an article came out in the newspaper
[04:47:52.700 --> 04:47:53.540]   when I was at the medium.
[04:47:53.540 --> 04:47:55.100]   It came out and said,
[04:47:55.100 --> 04:48:00.980]   'cause they're still investigating things.
[04:48:00.980 --> 04:48:04.140]   So this article comes out and I'm on the front page
[04:48:04.140 --> 04:48:07.200]   of the St. Petersburg Times.
[04:48:07.200 --> 04:48:09.140]   It was about the politician, big article.
[04:48:09.140 --> 04:48:12.860]   And in the article, it says they interview Millie,
[04:48:12.860 --> 04:48:14.460]   my lawyer, and she says,
[04:48:14.460 --> 04:48:17.700]   "Well, when Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI,
[04:48:17.700 --> 04:48:19.380]   "one of the first things they wanted to know about
[04:48:19.380 --> 04:48:22.620]   "was this politician."
[04:48:22.620 --> 04:48:27.320]   So she just said Mr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI.
[04:48:27.320 --> 04:48:30.100]   So I immediately get taken into custody
[04:48:30.100 --> 04:48:32.380]   and they put me in the shoe, the hole, right,
[04:48:32.380 --> 04:48:33.280]   for my own protection.
[04:48:33.280 --> 04:48:34.780]   And I'm there for like 45 days.
[04:48:34.780 --> 04:48:36.220]   And then after 45 days, they're like,
[04:48:36.220 --> 04:48:37.640]   "Cox, what do you want us to do?
[04:48:37.640 --> 04:48:38.780]   "Do you want us to ship you?"
[04:48:38.780 --> 04:48:41.580]   I was like, "No, put me back on the compound."
[04:48:41.580 --> 04:48:43.500]   I'm like, "Half the guys here cooperated."
[04:48:43.500 --> 04:48:45.420]   And he goes, "Yeah, it's more than half."
[04:48:45.420 --> 04:48:48.780]   He said, "But this is a guy from SIS,"
[04:48:48.780 --> 04:48:50.300]   which is like their internal security.
[04:48:50.300 --> 04:48:51.300]   - So that's when he told you
[04:48:51.300 --> 04:48:52.820]   that it's actually a much higher percentage.
[04:48:52.820 --> 04:48:54.860]   - Right, he goes, "But 90,"
[04:48:54.860 --> 04:48:56.820]   he said, "But 100% of them are lying about it."
[04:48:56.820 --> 04:48:58.460]   He said, "You just came out in the newspaper."
[04:48:58.460 --> 04:48:59.460]   I go, "Man, I'm not concerned."
[04:48:59.460 --> 04:49:00.300]   He goes, "You are concerned,
[04:49:00.300 --> 04:49:02.540]   "so you gotta come immediately to the lieutenant's office
[04:49:02.540 --> 04:49:04.260]   "and tell us, we'll ship you."
[04:49:04.260 --> 04:49:05.260]   I said, "Okay."
[04:49:05.260 --> 04:49:06.180]   I get out there.
[04:49:06.180 --> 04:49:09.420]   People are giving me like the looking at me
[04:49:09.420 --> 04:49:11.420]   and what's up, you know,
[04:49:11.420 --> 04:49:12.940]   but I don't have a lot of friends anyway.
[04:49:12.940 --> 04:49:14.660]   And I come there to make friends.
[04:49:14.660 --> 04:49:17.860]   And so at one point, this one guy comes to me,
[04:49:17.860 --> 04:49:20.780]   I'm walking the yard, probably two days later,
[04:49:20.780 --> 04:49:23.380]   after I get back on the compound, I'm walking.
[04:49:23.380 --> 04:49:25.620]   Guy comes to me, he has a goatee,
[04:49:25.620 --> 04:49:27.860]   and it comes down here and he's got a skull,
[04:49:27.860 --> 04:49:30.140]   like a little skull thing he'd made,
[04:49:30.140 --> 04:49:31.820]   whittled out of wood or something.
[04:49:31.820 --> 04:49:34.100]   And, you know, definitely looks scary.
[04:49:34.100 --> 04:49:35.880]   But so I'm walking and he's stopping, he goes,
[04:49:35.880 --> 04:49:37.700]   "Hey, Cox, I've never talked to these guys.
[04:49:37.700 --> 04:49:39.620]   "I had been there for a year or so
[04:49:39.620 --> 04:49:41.460]   "and never talked to any of these guys.
[04:49:41.460 --> 04:49:44.080]   "They're all like bikers and, you know,
[04:49:44.080 --> 04:49:45.420]   "Aryan brotherhood."
[04:49:45.420 --> 04:49:47.700]   And so I'm like, "Yeah, what's up?"
[04:49:47.700 --> 04:49:50.460]   He said, "Bubba, Bubba's their leader."
[04:49:50.460 --> 04:49:54.280]   He goes, "Bubba told me to tell you not to walk the yard.
[04:49:54.280 --> 04:49:55.940]   "He don't wanna see you out in the yard."
[04:49:55.940 --> 04:49:56.940]   And I went, "Okay."
[04:49:56.940 --> 04:49:59.980]   I said, "Well, I'm gonna walk the yard tonight."
[04:49:59.980 --> 04:50:01.380]   I said, "And if I get the shit kicked out of me,
[04:50:01.380 --> 04:50:02.220]   "then I get the shit kicked out of me."
[04:50:02.220 --> 04:50:04.900]   - But did you talk back to a guy
[04:50:04.900 --> 04:50:06.740]   with a wooden skull hanging off his beard?
[04:50:06.740 --> 04:50:07.740]   - I did, but you know what?
[04:50:07.740 --> 04:50:09.140]   It was right in front of the guard shack,
[04:50:09.140 --> 04:50:10.940]   and so there's guards in the guard shack.
[04:50:10.940 --> 04:50:13.180]   You know, like, they're 20 feet away.
[04:50:13.180 --> 04:50:14.420]   - Really, you weren't scared?
[04:50:14.420 --> 04:50:17.500]   - I mean, I think I just got numb.
[04:50:17.500 --> 04:50:20.700]   Like, I'm not stupid, but I'm walking around.
[04:50:20.700 --> 04:50:24.040]   You know, I was scared from the moment I got there on,
[04:50:24.040 --> 04:50:25.260]   if that makes sense.
[04:50:25.260 --> 04:50:26.820]   So you get to a point where you're just numb
[04:50:26.820 --> 04:50:27.980]   and you're waiting for it,
[04:50:27.980 --> 04:50:29.580]   especially when I got out of the shoe.
[04:50:29.580 --> 04:50:32.020]   Got out of the shoe, I went straight to my cell,
[04:50:32.020 --> 04:50:34.340]   laid down, couple minutes later, it was locked down.
[04:50:34.340 --> 04:50:35.380]   They closed the doors.
[04:50:35.380 --> 04:50:37.400]   I wake up the next morning, I go to chow.
[04:50:37.400 --> 04:50:39.140]   I go to my job.
[04:50:39.140 --> 04:50:40.900]   Like, it starts all over again.
[04:50:40.900 --> 04:50:44.000]   So I had a very packed routine.
[04:50:44.000 --> 04:50:46.340]   So I didn't spend, although there's guys everywhere,
[04:50:46.340 --> 04:50:47.820]   and I'm thinking at some point,
[04:50:47.820 --> 04:50:48.960]   I might just be walking around,
[04:50:48.960 --> 04:50:51.860]   a guy might walk up and just smash me in the head,
[04:50:51.860 --> 04:50:53.260]   but it didn't happen.
[04:50:53.260 --> 04:50:55.100]   And it's not the guys aren't getting stabbed,
[04:50:55.100 --> 04:50:56.520]   but they've got it coming.
[04:50:56.520 --> 04:50:58.560]   I didn't tell on anybody here.
[04:50:58.560 --> 04:50:59.400]   I didn't do anything.
[04:50:59.400 --> 04:51:00.620]   It's not that on other yards
[04:51:00.620 --> 04:51:02.880]   I might not have gotten smashed,
[04:51:02.880 --> 04:51:04.020]   but I didn't get smashed.
[04:51:04.020 --> 04:51:04.860]   And I'd been there a while
[04:51:04.860 --> 04:51:05.980]   and I taught the real estate class
[04:51:05.980 --> 04:51:08.860]   and everybody wanted to take real estate.
[04:51:08.860 --> 04:51:11.220]   So I think that insulated me to a degree.
[04:51:11.220 --> 04:51:15.620]   I also had made a few friends there.
[04:51:15.620 --> 04:51:17.320]   And I think they were probably also
[04:51:17.320 --> 04:51:18.420]   kind of putting out the words like,
[04:51:18.420 --> 04:51:20.520]   bro, cut this guy a break.
[04:51:20.520 --> 04:51:22.460]   So I'm walking across and I tell the guy,
[04:51:22.460 --> 04:51:23.860]   I said, look, man, I said, you know,
[04:51:23.860 --> 04:51:25.700]   and I wasn't rude to him.
[04:51:25.700 --> 04:51:28.280]   He wasn't even rude to me, really.
[04:51:28.280 --> 04:51:29.960]   He said, don't walk the yard anymore.
[04:51:29.960 --> 04:51:31.160]   Bubba doesn't want you to walk the yard.
[04:51:31.160 --> 04:51:32.440]   I said, well, listen, I'm gonna go to chow
[04:51:32.440 --> 04:51:34.560]   and then I'm gonna go out there tonight and walk the yard.
[04:51:34.560 --> 04:51:35.980]   And if I get smashed, I get smashed.
[04:51:35.980 --> 04:51:37.840]   I go, because I got 26 years
[04:51:37.840 --> 04:51:41.120]   and I cannot walk around for the next 26 years
[04:51:41.120 --> 04:51:42.620]   not going on the yard.
[04:51:42.620 --> 04:51:44.480]   I said, so I'm gonna be there
[04:51:44.480 --> 04:51:45.760]   and if that happens, then that happens.
[04:51:45.760 --> 04:51:46.920]   And he looked at me and he goes,
[04:51:46.920 --> 04:51:48.400]   man, I don't give a fuck what you do.
[04:51:48.400 --> 04:51:50.280]   That's what Bubba told me to tell you.
[04:51:50.280 --> 04:51:51.280]   He said, I told you.
[04:51:51.280 --> 04:51:52.760]   And he goes, I don't give a shit what you do.
[04:51:52.760 --> 04:51:54.200]   And he walked off.
[04:51:54.200 --> 04:51:58.380]   I went out there that night with a buddy of mine named Zach,
[04:51:58.380 --> 04:52:00.060]   a guy named John Gordon,
[04:52:00.060 --> 04:52:02.180]   with my cousin and a couple of his buddies.
[04:52:02.180 --> 04:52:04.060]   We walked the track for about an hour.
[04:52:04.060 --> 04:52:07.300]   Bubba and a group of his guys stood there and looked at us.
[04:52:07.300 --> 04:52:09.180]   And as we walked, probably closest we got to him
[04:52:09.180 --> 04:52:11.160]   was 30 or 40 feet.
[04:52:11.160 --> 04:52:12.780]   That went on for 30 minutes.
[04:52:12.780 --> 04:52:14.740]   And then they kind of broke up and went their separate ways.
[04:52:14.740 --> 04:52:16.540]   And, you know, there was a couple of times
[04:52:16.540 --> 04:52:18.140]   where I would go to the chow hall
[04:52:18.140 --> 04:52:21.180]   and I would go and I'd be sitting at a table
[04:52:21.180 --> 04:52:23.820]   and Bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at the table,
[04:52:23.820 --> 04:52:25.320]   I want to let you guys know you're,
[04:52:25.320 --> 04:52:26.640]   he didn't even call me a snitch.
[04:52:26.640 --> 04:52:30.040]   He said, you're sitting with a cooperating witness.
[04:52:30.040 --> 04:52:31.880]   He said, that's how you want to roll.
[04:52:31.880 --> 04:52:33.200]   He said, you ain't going to be rolling with us
[04:52:33.200 --> 04:52:34.680]   if there's any trouble.
[04:52:34.680 --> 04:52:36.320]   And then they all kind of looked at me
[04:52:36.320 --> 04:52:38.960]   and they got up, got their plate and they moved off.
[04:52:38.960 --> 04:52:41.080]   He didn't tell me to move.
[04:52:41.080 --> 04:52:42.000]   And he could have walked up and said,
[04:52:42.000 --> 04:52:43.120]   this is a snitch motherfucker.
[04:52:43.120 --> 04:52:44.400]   He didn't do that.
[04:52:44.400 --> 04:52:45.680]   Bubba was very respectful.
[04:52:45.680 --> 04:52:47.960]   So as respectful as he could be.
[04:52:47.960 --> 04:52:49.760]   - Whatever you want to say about Bubba,
[04:52:49.760 --> 04:52:50.840]   he was a respectful man.
[04:52:50.840 --> 04:52:52.320]   You ever talked to him directly?
[04:52:52.320 --> 04:52:54.280]   - Never had a conversation with him.
[04:52:54.280 --> 04:52:56.780]   So that went on, but I mean, when I say that went on,
[04:52:56.780 --> 04:52:59.260]   I mean, like literally like that's a couple of times.
[04:52:59.260 --> 04:53:02.220]   He said the same thing to a guy in line one time.
[04:53:02.220 --> 04:53:03.700]   Guy came up to me later and said, look, man,
[04:53:03.700 --> 04:53:05.580]   but I'm sorry, Matt, he was standing next to me in line.
[04:53:05.580 --> 04:53:06.580]   Bubba said something to him.
[04:53:06.580 --> 04:53:09.620]   He went like 10 or 15 people back and stood in line.
[04:53:09.620 --> 04:53:12.640]   Later on, he came up to me, Matt, I'm sorry, bro,
[04:53:12.640 --> 04:53:17.160]   but you know, I said, bro, I said, look, I get it.
[04:53:17.160 --> 04:53:18.000]   We're not friends.
[04:53:18.000 --> 04:53:18.820]   Don't worry about it.
[04:53:18.820 --> 04:53:19.980]   And here's the thing.
[04:53:19.980 --> 04:53:24.120]   At some point there, I got, I ended up getting,
[04:53:24.120 --> 04:53:27.960]   well, the FBI started showing up there at the prison,
[04:53:27.960 --> 04:53:32.280]   questioning me about my files in Tampa,
[04:53:32.280 --> 04:53:34.840]   the room of the 12 guys that were indicted.
[04:53:34.840 --> 04:53:37.720]   They show up and they start asking me about it.
[04:53:37.720 --> 04:53:39.740]   And so they're still kind of working it.
[04:53:39.740 --> 04:53:40.680]   Well, at the same time,
[04:53:40.680 --> 04:53:43.460]   I ended up getting moved to the low security prison.
[04:53:43.460 --> 04:53:45.120]   I get to low security prison.
[04:53:45.120 --> 04:53:49.200]   They show up over and over again.
[04:53:49.200 --> 04:53:51.860]   But at some point they come to me and they say,
[04:53:51.860 --> 04:53:55.320]   look, we went to the U.S. attorney.
[04:53:55.320 --> 04:53:57.200]   We presented everything we have.
[04:53:57.200 --> 04:53:59.900]   We have, I have enough for an invest,
[04:53:59.900 --> 04:54:03.260]   I have enough to indict all of these guys.
[04:54:03.260 --> 04:54:06.640]   I think it was whittled down to maybe eight instead of 12.
[04:54:06.640 --> 04:54:10.560]   And they said, look, the entire economy's melting down.
[04:54:10.560 --> 04:54:15.440]   At this point, some of these are four or five years old.
[04:54:17.860 --> 04:54:19.800]   We've got banks that are melting down right now.
[04:54:19.800 --> 04:54:22.540]   We got 100, 200, 300 million, 500,
[04:54:22.540 --> 04:54:25.220]   half a billion dollar banks that we're investigating.
[04:54:25.220 --> 04:54:27.100]   We don't have time to deal with this.
[04:54:27.100 --> 04:54:29.500]   We're not gonna, and we're not going to indict those people.
[04:54:29.500 --> 04:54:31.180]   So they get away.
[04:54:31.180 --> 04:54:32.380]   The agent I was working with,
[04:54:32.380 --> 04:54:36.380]   her name was Leslie Nelson, very nice person.
[04:54:36.380 --> 04:54:38.340]   She came, actually didn't have to do this,
[04:54:38.340 --> 04:54:42.660]   came to the prison to tell me this is what happened.
[04:54:42.660 --> 04:54:44.220]   And when she'd first come to see me,
[04:54:44.220 --> 04:54:47.460]   I told her, listen, I wanna do all this,
[04:54:47.460 --> 04:54:50.440]   but no matter what happens,
[04:54:50.440 --> 04:54:52.460]   I need you to write me a letter.
[04:54:52.460 --> 04:54:55.420]   If they don't indict these people,
[04:54:55.420 --> 04:54:56.760]   I need you to write me a letter
[04:54:56.760 --> 04:54:59.300]   that I can present to the US attorney
[04:54:59.300 --> 04:55:01.740]   on my behalf that I did everything I could.
[04:55:01.740 --> 04:55:03.840]   And she goes, I'll do that, but that's not gonna happen.
[04:55:03.840 --> 04:55:04.680]   We're gonna get the indictments and everything.
[04:55:04.680 --> 04:55:05.820]   I was like, okay.
[04:55:05.820 --> 04:55:07.100]   So of course, a year later,
[04:55:07.100 --> 04:55:08.860]   she shows up after nothing happens
[04:55:08.860 --> 04:55:09.860]   and they've dropped the case.
[04:55:09.860 --> 04:55:11.340]   She shows up and she tells me what happened
[04:55:11.340 --> 04:55:12.500]   and he's not gonna do it.
[04:55:12.500 --> 04:55:14.020]   I was, I go, do you remember that you,
[04:55:14.020 --> 04:55:15.900]   she goes, I got the letter right now.
[04:55:15.900 --> 04:55:16.740]   Gave me the letter.
[04:55:16.740 --> 04:55:19.560]   She was like, that's it, great letter.
[04:55:19.560 --> 04:55:23.540]   It says, Mr. Cox has worked, blah, blah, blah.
[04:55:23.540 --> 04:55:25.240]   He's done this, this is great.
[04:55:25.240 --> 04:55:27.980]   And even said, he deserves a reduction in my opinion,
[04:55:27.980 --> 04:55:29.020]   blah, blah, blah.
[04:55:29.020 --> 04:55:33.140]   So, but there's nobody, nobody was arrested.
[04:55:33.140 --> 04:55:36.580]   So I call my public defender, I call Millie,
[04:55:36.580 --> 04:55:41.580]   I explain it to her and she starts crying and she's sorry.
[04:55:41.580 --> 04:55:45.360]   And well, what are we gonna do?
[04:55:45.360 --> 04:55:47.260]   Well, there's nothing you can do.
[04:55:47.260 --> 04:55:48.840]   You're time barred.
[04:55:48.840 --> 04:55:53.340]   Like you have one year to file a 2255,
[04:55:53.340 --> 04:55:57.260]   which is to say that your lawyer is ineffective
[04:55:57.260 --> 04:56:00.620]   or that the court has made a mistake in some way.
[04:56:00.620 --> 04:56:02.220]   And it had been over a year.
[04:56:02.220 --> 04:56:04.300]   It had been years.
[04:56:04.300 --> 04:56:05.420]   It had been like four years.
[04:56:05.420 --> 04:56:06.660]   And she's like, yeah, I mean, you're just,
[04:56:06.660 --> 04:56:07.700]   there's nothing you can do.
[04:56:07.700 --> 04:56:12.240]   And she's in tears and I kind of feel like I'm done.
[04:56:12.240 --> 04:56:13.940]   At that point, I'm done.
[04:56:13.940 --> 04:56:16.560]   And what I do is I start writing a book, right?
[04:56:16.560 --> 04:56:18.180]   I write a memoir, my memoir.
[04:56:18.180 --> 04:56:23.640]   And this is not a shameless plug for my memoir, by the way,
[04:56:23.640 --> 04:56:25.700]   which is amazing, just saying.
[04:56:25.700 --> 04:56:30.700]   But, so what happens is I actually write it.
[04:56:30.700 --> 04:56:35.020]   I write it and then I have to rewrite it, right?
[04:56:35.020 --> 04:56:37.020]   'Cause I don't really know what I'm doing.
[04:56:37.020 --> 04:56:39.160]   And I'd been reading true crime and that sort of thing.
[04:56:39.160 --> 04:56:41.020]   And I've always liked true crime.
[04:56:41.020 --> 04:56:44.300]   I get a literary agent, comes to see me,
[04:56:44.300 --> 04:56:45.560]   tells me I have to rewrite some stuff.
[04:56:45.560 --> 04:56:46.800]   We rewrite it.
[04:56:46.800 --> 04:56:48.360]   As I'm finishing up my memoir,
[04:56:48.360 --> 04:56:50.260]   there's a guy that comes on the compound
[04:56:50.260 --> 04:56:53.460]   and his name is Ephraim Devaroli.
[04:56:53.460 --> 04:56:57.520]   Ephraim Devaroli and his business partner,
[04:56:57.520 --> 04:57:02.420]   a guy named David Packhouse were selling munitions,
[04:57:02.420 --> 04:57:05.120]   AK-47 rounds, really tons of munitions,
[04:57:05.120 --> 04:57:07.100]   but they got in trouble with this.
[04:57:07.100 --> 04:57:10.380]   And they were selling them to the U.S. government
[04:57:10.380 --> 04:57:13.420]   for the Afghani security forces.
[04:57:13.420 --> 04:57:14.500]   And there had been an article
[04:57:14.500 --> 04:57:17.420]   in "Rolling Stone" magazine about him and I'd read it.
[04:57:17.420 --> 04:57:18.660]   And somebody points him out and says,
[04:57:18.660 --> 04:57:20.180]   "Hey, that's that guy."
[04:57:20.180 --> 04:57:21.020]   And I went up to him and said,
[04:57:21.020 --> 04:57:22.520]   "Hey, bro, you just got here?"
[04:57:22.520 --> 04:57:23.360]   He's like, "Yeah."
[04:57:23.360 --> 04:57:25.140]   I said, "Look, if you wanna write a memoir or anything,
[04:57:25.140 --> 04:57:26.200]   "I'm finishing my memoir.
[04:57:26.200 --> 04:57:27.020]   "I can always help you.
[04:57:27.020 --> 04:57:28.080]   "I can help you write an outline.
[04:57:28.080 --> 04:57:29.300]   "You can get a professional writer,
[04:57:29.300 --> 04:57:30.340]   "whatever it is you need help."
[04:57:30.340 --> 04:57:31.740]   He's like, "Yeah, all right."
[04:57:31.740 --> 04:57:34.020]   Ephraim Devaroli was played by Jonah Hill
[04:57:34.020 --> 04:57:37.020]   in the movie "Wardogs."
[04:57:37.020 --> 04:57:41.120]   So a few months later, he comes to me and says,
[04:57:41.120 --> 04:57:43.620]   "Hey, they sold the movie rights."
[04:57:43.620 --> 04:57:46.180]   I was like, "Oh, wow, that's great."
[04:57:46.180 --> 04:57:49.560]   And I'm like, "And you don't wanna write a memoir?"
[04:57:49.560 --> 04:57:50.400]   And he's like, "Yeah, man,
[04:57:50.400 --> 04:57:52.800]   "it was sold to the guys from the 'Hangover' movie."
[04:57:52.800 --> 04:57:55.960]   And I was like, "So the guys from the 'Hangover' movie
[04:57:55.960 --> 04:57:58.700]   "are going to make a movie about you."
[04:57:58.700 --> 04:58:00.100]   I said, "You understand they're gonna call it
[04:58:00.100 --> 04:58:02.460]   "'Dude, where's my hand grenade?'
[04:58:02.460 --> 04:58:03.680]   "And you're gonna be Spicoli
[04:58:03.680 --> 04:58:05.500]   "from 'Fast Time' at Ridgemont High.
[04:58:05.500 --> 04:58:07.220]   "Like, you're gonna be a joke,
[04:58:07.220 --> 04:58:09.900]   "all because you don't wanna write a memoir.
[04:58:09.900 --> 04:58:11.420]   "And get your version out there."
[04:58:11.420 --> 04:58:12.980]   And he was like, "Holy shit."
[04:58:12.980 --> 04:58:14.940]   So I ended up writing an outline for him.
[04:58:14.940 --> 04:58:16.140]   We worked together.
[04:58:16.140 --> 04:58:17.460]   And then he asked, "Can I read your book?"
[04:58:17.460 --> 04:58:18.300]   I was like, "Sure."
[04:58:18.300 --> 04:58:20.020]   And I give it to him, and he reads it.
[04:58:20.020 --> 04:58:21.980]   And he comes back and he said, "Bro, this is the best thing
[04:58:21.980 --> 04:58:24.140]   "I've ever read in my life."
[04:58:24.140 --> 04:58:26.620]   And to be honest, I later found out he'd read
[04:58:26.620 --> 04:58:27.940]   about three books in his entire life.
[04:58:27.940 --> 04:58:30.540]   But still, it was very nice.
[04:58:30.540 --> 04:58:32.000]   - Still beat out the other two.
[04:58:32.000 --> 04:58:34.360]   - So he asked me if I'll write his book.
[04:58:34.360 --> 04:58:35.200]   I write his book.
[04:58:35.200 --> 04:58:36.100]   We work out a deal.
[04:58:36.100 --> 04:58:40.660]   And we do that.
[04:58:40.660 --> 04:58:43.660]   And I'm saying all this because I basically settle in.
[04:58:43.660 --> 04:58:44.940]   I'm done.
[04:58:44.940 --> 04:58:46.340]   I'm gonna do 26 years.
[04:58:46.340 --> 04:58:48.500]   - By the way, just on a small tangent,
[04:58:48.500 --> 04:58:52.560]   how did you know you'd be good at writing?
[04:58:52.560 --> 04:58:54.420]   - I'd kind of written a manuscript
[04:58:54.420 --> 04:58:56.900]   prior to even taking off on the run.
[04:58:56.900 --> 04:58:59.860]   I used to listen to John Grisham books.
[04:58:59.860 --> 04:59:01.540]   You know, I'd listen to 'em in the car.
[04:59:01.540 --> 04:59:03.020]   Like, I liked John Grisham books.
[04:59:03.020 --> 04:59:04.540]   And I'd actually written a manuscript
[04:59:04.540 --> 04:59:06.700]   about a mortgage broker.
[04:59:06.700 --> 04:59:07.840]   You know, he writes about lawyers,
[04:59:07.840 --> 04:59:09.480]   and it's like, being a lawyer's not exciting.
[04:59:09.480 --> 04:59:11.360]   If you can make that sound exciting,
[04:59:11.360 --> 04:59:13.240]   I can make being a mortgage broker.
[04:59:13.240 --> 04:59:16.860]   And I wrote a book, you know, put it at my desk.
[04:59:16.860 --> 04:59:19.720]   And, you know, the FBI found it.
[04:59:19.720 --> 04:59:22.340]   And they had, you know, said, "Oh, it's a blueprint
[04:59:22.340 --> 04:59:24.200]   "to the fraud that he's going to commit."
[04:59:24.200 --> 04:59:25.040]   It wasn't.
[04:59:25.040 --> 04:59:25.860]   Stop.
[04:59:25.860 --> 04:59:28.440]   It's as much, that character was as much me
[04:59:28.440 --> 04:59:31.200]   as John Grisham's characters are him.
[04:59:31.200 --> 04:59:33.200]   - But it's still kind of interesting that--
[04:59:33.200 --> 04:59:34.040]   - It is.
[04:59:34.040 --> 04:59:35.480]   - John Grisham didn't--
[04:59:35.480 --> 04:59:36.320]   - Right.
[04:59:36.320 --> 04:59:39.760]   I mean, you know, if John Grisham did something similar
[04:59:39.760 --> 04:59:40.580]   to what one of the--
[04:59:40.580 --> 04:59:41.420]   - Yeah.
[04:59:41.420 --> 04:59:46.420]   I saw a quote somewhere that the criminal is a true artist,
[04:59:46.420 --> 04:59:51.800]   and the detective is merely a critic.
[04:59:51.800 --> 04:59:52.800]   Something like that.
[04:59:52.800 --> 04:59:54.600]   Does that resonate with you or not?
[04:59:54.600 --> 04:59:55.840]   - I'll have to look that up.
[04:59:55.840 --> 04:59:56.680]   - Okay.
[04:59:56.680 --> 04:59:58.280]   So you already knew you could write.
[04:59:58.280 --> 04:59:59.180]   - Well, I knew I liked it.
[04:59:59.180 --> 05:00:00.960]   But yeah, I think I got better and better at it.
[05:00:00.960 --> 05:00:02.020]   I mean, you know, as you're writing.
[05:00:02.020 --> 05:00:04.020]   And they had creative writing classes, you know,
[05:00:04.020 --> 05:00:05.780]   in prison at the low.
[05:00:05.780 --> 05:00:10.420]   You know, the low was a much different breed of animal.
[05:00:10.420 --> 05:00:12.300]   You know, like it, you know, it was,
[05:00:12.300 --> 05:00:13.900]   you could very easily get hurt.
[05:00:13.900 --> 05:00:15.420]   You could get hurt either place.
[05:00:15.420 --> 05:00:19.020]   But there were guys that have life sentences
[05:00:19.020 --> 05:00:21.020]   that had been working out for 20 years
[05:00:21.020 --> 05:00:24.100]   and were just super angry, you know, at the medium.
[05:00:24.100 --> 05:00:25.540]   And if you got hurt at the medium,
[05:00:25.540 --> 05:00:28.500]   it was probably really go bad.
[05:00:28.500 --> 05:00:30.500]   As opposed to you get hurt at the low,
[05:00:30.500 --> 05:00:34.540]   it's more like a fist fight in high school.
[05:00:34.540 --> 05:00:37.100]   So with knives.
[05:00:37.100 --> 05:00:42.100]   So anyway, I, so I'm there, I'm writing, I'm doing that.
[05:00:42.100 --> 05:00:46.400]   And there was a guy on the compound
[05:00:46.400 --> 05:00:48.140]   that came on the compound about that same time.
[05:00:48.140 --> 05:00:49.920]   His name was Frank Amadeo.
[05:00:49.920 --> 05:00:54.660]   Frank Amadeo is a rapid cycling bipolar
[05:00:54.660 --> 05:00:56.820]   with features of schizophrenia.
[05:00:56.820 --> 05:00:59.700]   - Rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia.
[05:01:00.700 --> 05:01:03.540]   - So it's just constant, right?
[05:01:03.540 --> 05:01:06.700]   And so there are moments in his manic state
[05:01:06.700 --> 05:01:11.700]   where he, his reoccurring psychosis, I guess,
[05:01:11.700 --> 05:01:15.620]   is that he believes, and since he was in his early teens,
[05:01:15.620 --> 05:01:18.700]   has believed that he is preordained by God
[05:01:18.700 --> 05:01:20.160]   to be emperor of the world.
[05:01:20.160 --> 05:01:23.960]   He's a lawyer, disbarred,
[05:01:23.960 --> 05:01:26.760]   stole close to $200 million from the federal government.
[05:01:26.760 --> 05:01:29.820]   They gave him 22 years and they sent him to Coleman.
[05:01:29.820 --> 05:01:34.180]   But it doesn't, this is the part I love,
[05:01:34.180 --> 05:01:36.540]   the delusions don't affect his legal work.
[05:01:36.540 --> 05:01:40.900]   Doesn't say a ton for legal community, but--
[05:01:40.900 --> 05:01:42.700]   - How do you know he's delusional?
[05:01:42.700 --> 05:01:43.900]   I'm just asking questions.
[05:01:43.900 --> 05:01:47.060]   - Yeah, he's, trust me, he, I mean, it's not me.
[05:01:47.060 --> 05:01:50.820]   It's like the transcripts, the lawyers, the doctors,
[05:01:50.820 --> 05:01:54.440]   the, you know, there's a ton of, a ton.
[05:01:54.440 --> 05:01:56.000]   And then if you saw him in action,
[05:01:56.000 --> 05:01:57.100]   you'd be like, oh, wow.
[05:01:57.100 --> 05:01:57.940]   - Yeah.
[05:01:57.940 --> 05:02:00.140]   - You know, he'd be, he would be completely normal.
[05:02:00.140 --> 05:02:02.740]   He would be having a completely normal conversation.
[05:02:02.740 --> 05:02:07.500]   And somebody would say something and he was, he'd go,
[05:02:07.500 --> 05:02:11.020]   that makes me so angry, I, I, I can't,
[05:02:11.020 --> 05:02:12.220]   I'm not gonna let them do that.
[05:02:12.220 --> 05:02:16.600]   When my legions march on Washington,
[05:02:16.600 --> 05:02:18.860]   we are going to burn the Constitution
[05:02:18.860 --> 05:02:21.880]   and the president will kneel at my feet.
[05:02:24.180 --> 05:02:25.020]   And he goes.
[05:02:25.020 --> 05:02:31.120]   I'm gonna need your transcripts.
[05:02:31.120 --> 05:02:33.280]   I'm gonna need a 2255 form.
[05:02:33.280 --> 05:02:35.180]   We're gonna file a, you know, and it would just,
[05:02:35.180 --> 05:02:36.620]   and everybody would sit there and be like,
[05:02:36.620 --> 05:02:38.420]   okay, Frank, I'll get this and I'll get.
[05:02:38.420 --> 05:02:39.260]   It was insane.
[05:02:39.260 --> 05:02:40.080]   It was the most insane.
[05:02:40.080 --> 05:02:42.960]   He was basically running a medium-sized law firm
[05:02:42.960 --> 05:02:44.480]   from inside of the prison.
[05:02:44.480 --> 05:02:46.120]   He was training people.
[05:02:46.120 --> 05:02:48.760]   He taught the, he taught the,
[05:02:48.760 --> 05:02:53.360]   the legal research class and was training people
[05:02:53.360 --> 05:02:56.000]   on how to do legal research in prison,
[05:02:56.000 --> 05:02:59.140]   how to put together motions, how to fight,
[05:02:59.140 --> 05:03:01.300]   fight their cases, how to do the research,
[05:03:01.300 --> 05:03:03.020]   how to type them up, everything.
[05:03:03.020 --> 05:03:05.840]   He's teaching, he's teaching a law,
[05:03:05.840 --> 05:03:07.040]   it's like a law school, right?
[05:03:07.040 --> 05:03:08.240]   Like he's teaching these guys.
[05:03:08.240 --> 05:03:11.280]   He, they made such a mistake locking this guy up.
[05:03:11.280 --> 05:03:12.520]   - So he's a great lawyer.
[05:03:12.520 --> 05:03:14.340]   - Listen, it's gonna get worse.
[05:03:14.340 --> 05:03:16.120]   It's gonna get worse because here's what happens
[05:03:16.120 --> 05:03:18.560]   is at this point, I don't talk to him
[05:03:18.560 --> 05:03:20.200]   for probably a year or so
[05:03:20.200 --> 05:03:22.680]   because everybody's saying he's crazy, you know?
[05:03:22.680 --> 05:03:24.880]   And he's, and for like a year, he gets there,
[05:03:24.880 --> 05:03:26.480]   he's drooling out of the side of his mouth.
[05:03:26.480 --> 05:03:28.040]   They got him on a ton of medication.
[05:03:28.040 --> 05:03:29.920]   It takes him about a year to get them
[05:03:29.920 --> 05:03:31.600]   to take him off the medication.
[05:03:31.600 --> 05:03:33.960]   So he gets them to take him off the medication.
[05:03:33.960 --> 05:03:36.280]   And then he starts kind of stabilizing his mood
[05:03:36.280 --> 05:03:37.580]   by drinking Pepsi.
[05:03:37.580 --> 05:03:40.400]   I know, but it's crazy.
[05:03:40.400 --> 05:03:41.240]   I know it's crazy.
[05:03:41.240 --> 05:03:42.700]   I know how, I see, I see you looking at me
[05:03:42.700 --> 05:03:43.660]   like this guy's delusional.
[05:03:43.660 --> 05:03:44.500]   I know.
[05:03:44.500 --> 05:03:45.880]   - It works, whatever works.
[05:03:45.880 --> 05:03:49.480]   - So at some point, one of my buddies comes to me
[05:03:49.480 --> 05:03:52.320]   and says, look, you gotta go talk to Frank.
[05:03:52.320 --> 05:03:53.160]   Wait, here's the other thing.
[05:03:53.160 --> 05:03:54.320]   Over the course of a year or two
[05:03:54.320 --> 05:03:56.560]   that he starts doing legal work for guys,
[05:03:56.560 --> 05:03:58.880]   he starts just taking on guys' cases.
[05:03:58.880 --> 05:03:59.720]   I'll do the motion.
[05:03:59.720 --> 05:04:00.640]   I'll do your legal work.
[05:04:00.640 --> 05:04:01.560]   I'll do this.
[05:04:01.560 --> 05:04:03.000]   Keeps him busy.
[05:04:03.000 --> 05:04:06.140]   But suddenly you start hearing people get released.
[05:04:06.140 --> 05:04:10.320]   Jimmy just got 10 years knocked off his sentence.
[05:04:10.320 --> 05:04:13.200]   He's going to halfway house next month.
[05:04:13.200 --> 05:04:16.040]   Tom got an immediate release.
[05:04:16.040 --> 05:04:19.340]   Frank's walking people up to R&D, shaking their hands.
[05:04:19.340 --> 05:04:22.400]   Guys are walking up to him in tears, crying.
[05:04:22.400 --> 05:04:27.400]   And so, you know, crazy or not, what choice do I have?
[05:04:27.400 --> 05:04:31.940]   I called three different lawyers on the street
[05:04:31.940 --> 05:04:33.620]   and said, this is what happened.
[05:04:33.620 --> 05:04:35.240]   What can I do?
[05:04:35.240 --> 05:04:36.140]   What can I do?
[05:04:36.140 --> 05:04:38.820]   They had me, they told me to do this and this and this,
[05:04:38.820 --> 05:04:39.660]   and I worked with them,
[05:04:39.660 --> 05:04:41.260]   and then they decided not to proceed.
[05:04:41.260 --> 05:04:42.340]   And what can I do?
[05:04:42.340 --> 05:04:44.220]   And they said, you're hit, bro.
[05:04:44.220 --> 05:04:45.260]   There's nothing you can do.
[05:04:45.260 --> 05:04:48.500]   You cannot, in the 11th circuit,
[05:04:48.500 --> 05:04:52.860]   you cannot force them to file a reduction on your behalf.
[05:04:52.860 --> 05:04:53.900]   You cannot do it.
[05:04:53.900 --> 05:04:54.740]   It's impossible.
[05:04:54.740 --> 05:04:56.500]   You're hit, you're done, it's over.
[05:04:56.500 --> 05:04:59.060]   I'd love to take your money, Mr. Cox,
[05:04:59.060 --> 05:04:59.900]   but it's not going to happen.
[05:04:59.900 --> 05:05:01.780]   I can't, I'm just going to take your money.
[05:05:01.780 --> 05:05:02.800]   You're going to lose.
[05:05:02.800 --> 05:05:03.660]   Three different lawyers.
[05:05:03.660 --> 05:05:07.660]   I talked to, our TI's lawyer told me,
[05:05:07.660 --> 05:05:09.960]   bro, it's not going to happen, it's over.
[05:05:09.960 --> 05:05:14.060]   So my buddy says, go talk to Frank.
[05:05:14.060 --> 05:05:15.980]   I said, well, why wouldn't I?
[05:05:15.980 --> 05:05:16.900]   I got nothing else to lose.
[05:05:16.900 --> 05:05:17.980]   So I go talk to Frank.
[05:05:17.980 --> 05:05:19.740]   He actually has a little manic moment.
[05:05:19.740 --> 05:05:21.460]   That little thing that I just showed you,
[05:05:21.460 --> 05:05:24.260]   that's exactly what he said the first time I talked to him.
[05:05:24.260 --> 05:05:25.220]   - Based on your case.
[05:05:25.220 --> 05:05:26.040]   - Yes.
[05:05:26.040 --> 05:05:27.100]   I won't let this happen.
[05:05:27.100 --> 05:05:28.180]   He's like, I'm going to need your transcripts.
[05:05:28.180 --> 05:05:29.020]   I'm going to need you to get this.
[05:05:29.020 --> 05:05:29.900]   I need to see your indictment.
[05:05:29.900 --> 05:05:31.460]   I'm going to need your pre-sentence report.
[05:05:31.460 --> 05:05:33.100]   I'm going to need, he's like, okay.
[05:05:33.100 --> 05:05:34.940]   And I turned to my buddy, he's like, bro, I know.
[05:05:34.940 --> 05:05:35.860]   I know what you're thinking.
[05:05:35.860 --> 05:05:36.700]   It's fine.
[05:05:36.700 --> 05:05:37.900]   I'm like, it's fucking crazy.
[05:05:37.900 --> 05:05:39.340]   And he's like, I understand.
[05:05:39.340 --> 05:05:42.020]   Let just, what choice do you have?
[05:05:42.020 --> 05:05:43.660]   I was like, fuck.
[05:05:43.660 --> 05:05:48.260]   So Frank files a 2255 motion on my behalf,
[05:05:48.260 --> 05:05:52.020]   stating that I'm not time-barred,
[05:05:52.020 --> 05:05:54.460]   that Millie was,
[05:05:54.460 --> 05:05:57.400]   we file it against Millie,
[05:05:57.400 --> 05:05:59.100]   stating that she was ineffective.
[05:05:59.100 --> 05:06:03.180]   That she didn't understand the law.
[05:06:03.180 --> 05:06:04.460]   She had me plead to something
[05:06:04.460 --> 05:06:06.620]   'cause she thought I could get a reduction
[05:06:06.620 --> 05:06:10.020]   simply for doing dateline.
[05:06:10.020 --> 05:06:11.440]   Oh, by the way, when I was in the medium,
[05:06:11.440 --> 05:06:12.700]   the government came to me and asked me
[05:06:12.700 --> 05:06:15.340]   to be interviewed by American Greed.
[05:06:15.340 --> 05:06:16.160]   I do that.
[05:06:16.160 --> 05:06:17.000]   I'm interviewed.
[05:06:17.000 --> 05:06:17.860]   You know, they get me on the phone.
[05:06:17.860 --> 05:06:19.220]   They talk to me, everything.
[05:06:19.220 --> 05:06:21.220]   The prosecutor wants me to do it.
[05:06:21.220 --> 05:06:22.180]   She's re-interviewed.
[05:06:22.180 --> 05:06:23.540]   Everybody's re-interviewed.
[05:06:23.540 --> 05:06:24.740]   It airs.
[05:06:24.740 --> 05:06:27.020]   Millie goes to the government and says,
[05:06:27.020 --> 05:06:27.860]   look, reduce the sentence.
[05:06:27.860 --> 05:06:29.520]   They go, no, Millie, it's not enough.
[05:06:29.520 --> 05:06:31.020]   Then they come to me and they ask me
[05:06:31.020 --> 05:06:34.060]   to write an ethics and fraud course.
[05:06:34.060 --> 05:06:35.460]   I write an ethics and fraud course.
[05:06:35.460 --> 05:06:36.900]   The guy I write the course with,
[05:06:36.900 --> 05:06:38.700]   they flies up to Atlanta.
[05:06:38.700 --> 05:06:40.040]   He talks with, I think he drove up,
[05:06:40.040 --> 05:06:41.380]   but he goes up to Atlanta.
[05:06:41.380 --> 05:06:43.580]   He talks with a U.S. attorney, talks to Millie.
[05:06:43.580 --> 05:06:46.940]   She insists if he does this, I will reduce his sentence.
[05:06:46.940 --> 05:06:50.720]   I will definitely consider this, definitely consider.
[05:06:50.720 --> 05:06:52.140]   - Yeah, definitely consider.
[05:06:52.140 --> 05:06:53.140]   - And then we do it.
[05:06:53.140 --> 05:06:55.160]   It's being used all over the nation.
[05:06:55.160 --> 05:06:57.980]   Not enough.
[05:06:57.980 --> 05:06:58.940]   - Considered it.
[05:06:58.940 --> 05:07:01.760]   - That's where, at this point, I go to Frank.
[05:07:01.760 --> 05:07:03.420]   I tell Frank what's happening.
[05:07:03.420 --> 05:07:04.860]   Frank says, yeah, this is, he goes,
[05:07:04.860 --> 05:07:07.100]   every time they asked you to do something,
[05:07:07.100 --> 05:07:08.900]   it reset the time bar.
[05:07:08.900 --> 05:07:11.240]   You have a year from that time to file a 2255.
[05:07:11.240 --> 05:07:14.700]   Now, he insists that that was a viable argument.
[05:07:14.700 --> 05:07:16.180]   Nobody else does.
[05:07:16.180 --> 05:07:17.900]   But he said, I'm not gonna let them do this.
[05:07:17.900 --> 05:07:18.860]   I'm gonna take care of this.
[05:07:18.860 --> 05:07:20.580]   I'm gonna get your sentence reduced.
[05:07:20.580 --> 05:07:21.420]   Okay.
[05:07:21.420 --> 05:07:23.940]   Emperor.
[05:07:23.940 --> 05:07:26.340]   Okay, emperor.
[05:07:26.340 --> 05:07:29.940]   So, he is a character.
[05:07:29.940 --> 05:07:32.960]   Anyway, he, so he files a 2255.
[05:07:32.960 --> 05:07:35.060]   The government comes back.
[05:07:35.060 --> 05:07:37.260]   They say, he's time barred.
[05:07:37.260 --> 05:07:38.220]   Frank comes back.
[05:07:38.840 --> 05:07:40.680]   You know, they answer his motion.
[05:07:40.680 --> 05:07:42.880]   He files a retort.
[05:07:42.880 --> 05:07:45.800]   They file, you know, it just goes back and forth.
[05:07:45.800 --> 05:07:48.120]   It's on for six months to a year.
[05:07:48.120 --> 05:07:51.520]   And at some point, I go to mail call,
[05:07:51.520 --> 05:07:54.480]   and they call my name, and they hand me this thing,
[05:07:54.480 --> 05:07:56.560]   and I open it up, and it says,
[05:07:56.560 --> 05:07:59.680]   the government's filed a motion for a stay
[05:07:59.680 --> 05:08:03.960]   so that they can, they want the court to appoint me a lawyer
[05:08:05.680 --> 05:08:10.680]   and to discuss filing a Rule 35, reducing my sentence.
[05:08:10.680 --> 05:08:14.420]   And I, you know, I'm like, I read it,
[05:08:14.420 --> 05:08:15.580]   but I couldn't even understand.
[05:08:15.580 --> 05:08:16.420]   Like, well, I don't understand.
[05:08:16.420 --> 05:08:18.200]   So, I mean, I rushed to go find Frank.
[05:08:18.200 --> 05:08:20.140]   I show it to Frank, and he says,
[05:08:20.140 --> 05:08:21.560]   he says, yeah, they're staying it.
[05:08:21.560 --> 05:08:22.740]   They're gonna send you a lawyer,
[05:08:22.740 --> 05:08:24.100]   and you're gonna negotiate
[05:08:24.100 --> 05:08:27.440]   for how much they're gonna reduce your sentence.
[05:08:27.440 --> 05:08:28.740]   He says, perfect.
[05:08:28.740 --> 05:08:31.100]   So, they fly this woman down.
[05:08:31.100 --> 05:08:32.500]   Her name was Esther Panitch.
[05:08:32.500 --> 05:08:35.420]   She flies down.
[05:08:35.420 --> 05:08:37.120]   We, comes to the visitation room.
[05:08:37.120 --> 05:08:38.460]   They bring me there, the lawyer's room,
[05:08:38.460 --> 05:08:39.580]   whatever they call it.
[05:08:39.580 --> 05:08:42.020]   And so, we're sitting there, and I remember we're talking,
[05:08:42.020 --> 05:08:45.460]   and she says, listen, your motion, your 2255,
[05:08:45.460 --> 05:08:46.980]   it's written well, but honestly,
[05:08:46.980 --> 05:08:49.060]   you don't have much of a prayer,
[05:08:49.060 --> 05:08:52.540]   and they're offering you a one-level reduction,
[05:08:52.540 --> 05:08:55.620]   which is 30 months.
[05:08:55.620 --> 05:09:00.280]   And I went, oh, that's not enough.
[05:09:00.280 --> 05:09:03.340]   And she said, well, I don't know what to tell you.
[05:09:03.340 --> 05:09:06.980]   She said, they're willing to bring you back.
[05:09:06.980 --> 05:09:11.980]   And I was like, well, I mean, I don't know.
[05:09:11.980 --> 05:09:13.460]   I gotta talk to Frank.
[05:09:13.460 --> 05:09:15.060]   Frank said I deserve this many levels,
[05:09:15.060 --> 05:09:16.260]   and we're going back and forth.
[05:09:16.260 --> 05:09:17.100]   She goes, who's Frank?
[05:09:17.100 --> 05:09:18.700]   And I go, Frank's the guy that's doing all my legal work.
[05:09:18.700 --> 05:09:20.000]   She goes, he didn't write all this?
[05:09:20.000 --> 05:09:20.840]   And I was like, no.
[05:09:20.840 --> 05:09:21.660]   She goes, who wrote it?
[05:09:21.660 --> 05:09:23.720]   And I explain it to her, and she's like, he's an inmate?
[05:09:23.720 --> 05:09:24.560]   And I was like, yeah.
[05:09:24.560 --> 05:09:25.620]   And she's, why is he here?
[05:09:25.620 --> 05:09:27.620]   And I tell her, well, 'cause he stole a bunch of money
[05:09:27.620 --> 05:09:28.460]   from the federal government,
[05:09:28.460 --> 05:09:29.660]   'cause he's trying to take over the world.
[05:09:29.660 --> 05:09:31.060]   So, I tell her that whole thing,
[05:09:31.060 --> 05:09:36.060]   and she's like, you're letting a mentally incompetent
[05:09:36.060 --> 05:09:40.140]   person do your legal work.
[05:09:40.140 --> 05:09:40.980]   And I was like, yeah,
[05:09:40.980 --> 05:09:43.780]   because all the competent attorneys wouldn't do it.
[05:09:43.780 --> 05:09:45.380]   They said I didn't have a prayer.
[05:09:45.380 --> 05:09:47.700]   Your people said I didn't have a prayer.
[05:09:47.700 --> 05:09:50.260]   And I said, Frank said he could get this done.
[05:09:50.260 --> 05:09:52.220]   And she's like, well, I mean,
[05:09:52.220 --> 05:09:56.340]   I don't even know why they're offering you one level.
[05:09:56.340 --> 05:09:58.540]   I was like, well, Frank said,
[05:09:58.540 --> 05:09:59.700]   and I'm like, Frank this, Frank that.
[05:09:59.700 --> 05:10:01.580]   And so, I end up saying, she's like,
[05:10:01.580 --> 05:10:04.780]   you're taking advice from a legally incompetent person.
[05:10:04.780 --> 05:10:05.620]   I said, yeah.
[05:10:05.620 --> 05:10:08.180]   And she said, you really don't have a prayer.
[05:10:08.180 --> 05:10:10.540]   I said, then why are you here?
[05:10:10.540 --> 05:10:14.260]   I said, if they could crush me so easily, why are you here?
[05:10:14.260 --> 05:10:17.380]   I said, they're giving me one level.
[05:10:17.380 --> 05:10:18.200]   Let me talk to Frank.
[05:10:18.200 --> 05:10:19.200]   I'll let you know what we're gonna do.
[05:10:19.200 --> 05:10:20.720]   So, I leave.
[05:10:20.720 --> 05:10:21.940]   I call her a couple days later.
[05:10:21.940 --> 05:10:23.100]   I talk to Frank.
[05:10:23.100 --> 05:10:24.140]   Frank said, go back.
[05:10:24.140 --> 05:10:27.100]   Go back and argue for more.
[05:10:27.100 --> 05:10:28.740]   He said, I think the judge is gonna give you more.
[05:10:28.740 --> 05:10:31.140]   He's gonna give you at least between whatever,
[05:10:31.140 --> 05:10:33.980]   he said like six or seven levels or something.
[05:10:33.980 --> 05:10:37.140]   So, I get moved all the way back to Atlanta.
[05:10:37.140 --> 05:10:40.700]   The FBI agent comes to talk on my behalf.
[05:10:40.700 --> 05:10:43.060]   The guy that, like multiple people show up
[05:10:43.060 --> 05:10:44.660]   to talk on my behalf.
[05:10:44.660 --> 05:10:49.580]   They say, Millie, who I filed the 2255 against.
[05:10:49.580 --> 05:10:52.640]   So, I'm basically saying, you're ineffective.
[05:10:52.640 --> 05:10:53.580]   You're incompetent.
[05:10:53.580 --> 05:10:55.380]   But she knows the game.
[05:10:55.380 --> 05:10:56.640]   She's like, I get it.
[05:10:56.640 --> 05:11:00.740]   She gets on the stand and testifies for me.
[05:11:00.740 --> 05:11:05.780]   So, the judge goes, you know, listen,
[05:11:05.780 --> 05:11:07.580]   I think we were asking for like nine levels
[05:11:07.580 --> 05:11:09.380]   or something outrageous.
[05:11:09.380 --> 05:11:11.620]   Prosecutor starts arguing for one level.
[05:11:11.620 --> 05:11:16.620]   And he said, listen, one level is not nearly enough
[05:11:16.620 --> 05:11:18.380]   for what Mr. Cox has done.
[05:11:18.380 --> 05:11:20.460]   He said, Mr. Cox, I know you're arguing
[05:11:20.460 --> 05:11:23.020]   for nine levels off your sentence.
[05:11:23.020 --> 05:11:24.780]   He goes, that was never gonna happen.
[05:11:24.780 --> 05:11:28.040]   I'm just like, I felt like I got slapped.
[05:11:28.040 --> 05:11:31.040]   And he said, so I'm gonna go with six levels.
[05:11:31.040 --> 05:11:32.560]   No, no, I'm sorry, he said three levels.
[05:11:32.560 --> 05:11:33.680]   I'm gonna go with three levels.
[05:11:33.680 --> 05:11:36.720]   He goes, which is seven years.
[05:11:36.720 --> 05:11:39.420]   Which he said, for somebody who has no arrest
[05:11:39.420 --> 05:11:43.360]   associated with this case, he said, I think it's pretty good
[05:11:43.360 --> 05:11:45.600]   and that's his judgment and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[05:11:45.600 --> 05:11:48.720]   And he hammered, put the gavel down and walks off.
[05:11:48.720 --> 05:11:50.560]   That's it, it's over, I got seven years.
[05:11:50.560 --> 05:11:51.880]   And I was hoping for more.
[05:11:51.880 --> 05:11:54.200]   So, I get moved back to Coleman.
[05:11:54.200 --> 05:11:57.220]   I get moved back to Coleman and I go up to Frank
[05:11:57.220 --> 05:11:59.200]   and I said, Frank, I got seven years off.
[05:11:59.200 --> 05:12:01.200]   And he's like, I know, I know.
[05:12:01.200 --> 05:12:04.380]   I said, I don't mean to sound unappreciative.
[05:12:04.380 --> 05:12:07.800]   I said, I just, I said, I was hoping for more.
[05:12:07.800 --> 05:12:08.940]   He goes, I was too.
[05:12:08.940 --> 05:12:11.100]   He said, it looks like we're gonna have to eat
[05:12:11.100 --> 05:12:14.120]   this elephant one spoonful at a time.
[05:12:14.120 --> 05:12:16.860]   And he goes, something will come out.
[05:12:16.860 --> 05:12:18.440]   Something's gonna happen.
[05:12:18.440 --> 05:12:23.440]   He said, keep your ears open, something will happen.
[05:12:23.440 --> 05:12:24.880]   And I said, okay.
[05:12:24.880 --> 05:12:29.680]   And honestly, by that point, I'd done eight years
[05:12:29.680 --> 05:12:32.400]   and I remember if I got a year off for the drug program
[05:12:32.400 --> 05:12:34.120]   and good time and this and that, I had about eight
[05:12:34.120 --> 05:12:37.120]   or eight years left to go or something, nine years left.
[05:12:37.120 --> 05:12:40.160]   And I was like, I can do that, I'll write.
[05:12:40.160 --> 05:12:41.300]   I'd been writing.
[05:12:41.300 --> 05:12:48.080]   By that point, I'd actually written a story.
[05:12:48.080 --> 05:12:51.620]   Like I got a book deal for Debroli.
[05:12:52.340 --> 05:12:53.180]   You know?
[05:12:53.180 --> 05:12:59.920]   And I ended up writing a synopsis of a guy's story
[05:12:59.920 --> 05:13:03.580]   and I got him in Rolling Stone Magazine
[05:13:03.580 --> 05:13:04.820]   and I got a book deal for that.
[05:13:04.820 --> 05:13:07.420]   Like I got it in advance, it was like 3,500 bucks.
[05:13:07.420 --> 05:13:10.340]   For being in prison, a prisoner to get a $3,500 advance,
[05:13:10.340 --> 05:13:13.420]   like, I'm a millionaire, that's a lot of money.
[05:13:13.420 --> 05:13:17.580]   So, and then we optioned the film rights.
[05:13:17.580 --> 05:13:21.940]   Basically, the synopsis that I wrote for this reporter,
[05:13:21.940 --> 05:13:23.700]   journalist for Rolling Stone,
[05:13:23.700 --> 05:13:27.140]   he goes to Rolling Stone with what I wrote
[05:13:27.140 --> 05:13:28.740]   and gives it to them and they okay it.
[05:13:28.740 --> 05:13:29.700]   They say, yeah, this is great.
[05:13:29.700 --> 05:13:31.660]   We want you to write an article based on this.
[05:13:31.660 --> 05:13:33.100]   Okay, he writes the article.
[05:13:33.100 --> 05:13:38.100]   He tells me that the article will be from him,
[05:13:38.100 --> 05:13:42.140]   his name, Guy Lawson, Douglas Dodd,
[05:13:42.140 --> 05:13:44.580]   which is the name of the kid I wrote the memoir about,
[05:13:44.580 --> 05:13:45.940]   and Matthew Cox.
[05:13:45.940 --> 05:13:51.700]   Couple of weeks before the article is going to be published,
[05:13:51.700 --> 05:13:56.000]   he tells me Rolling Stone doesn't want my name
[05:13:56.000 --> 05:13:58.300]   on the article because I'm in federal prison
[05:13:58.300 --> 05:14:00.500]   and it doesn't look good.
[05:14:00.500 --> 05:14:05.500]   But don't worry, he's gonna put my name in the article
[05:14:05.500 --> 05:14:07.100]   and that's just as good.
[05:14:07.100 --> 05:14:10.180]   And I argue, it's not just as good, it's not.
[05:14:10.180 --> 05:14:13.660]   I'm like, I would be a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.
[05:14:13.660 --> 05:14:15.860]   Like you understand, I'm trying to come up
[05:14:15.860 --> 05:14:18.700]   with something here that I can rebuild my life
[05:14:18.700 --> 05:14:20.780]   as a true crime writer.
[05:14:20.780 --> 05:14:21.860]   That's no good.
[05:14:21.860 --> 05:14:25.100]   And that wasn't so bad.
[05:14:25.100 --> 05:14:25.940]   That wasn't the worst of it.
[05:14:25.940 --> 05:14:30.940]   The worst of it was 90% of the article that he published
[05:14:30.940 --> 05:14:35.460]   was taken directly from what I sent him.
[05:14:35.460 --> 05:14:38.640]   Like, I mean, sick to my stomach, bro.
[05:14:38.640 --> 05:14:40.300]   Just sick over it.
[05:14:41.060 --> 05:14:44.620]   But they optioned the life rights for that.
[05:14:44.620 --> 05:14:46.460]   And I got a piece of that.
[05:14:46.460 --> 05:14:48.120]   So there's like $7,000.
[05:14:48.120 --> 05:14:48.960]   I get a check for that.
[05:14:48.960 --> 05:14:50.700]   So I'm thrilled, I can keep writing
[05:14:50.700 --> 05:14:51.620]   'cause you have to understand,
[05:14:51.620 --> 05:14:54.260]   writing on the computer there, they charge you.
[05:14:54.260 --> 05:14:56.260]   So I start writing, oh, they charge you for phone calls,
[05:14:56.260 --> 05:14:59.020]   writing, every single thing costs money.
[05:14:59.020 --> 05:15:01.500]   So I start writing all these guys' stories.
[05:15:01.500 --> 05:15:02.820]   I start writing books.
[05:15:02.820 --> 05:15:07.660]   I just come back from, went back to Atlanta,
[05:15:07.660 --> 05:15:11.460]   got seven years knocked off my sentence, come back,
[05:15:11.460 --> 05:15:14.260]   and I'm walking around the compound.
[05:15:14.260 --> 05:15:18.580]   Now, there was a guy that was there named Ron Wilson.
[05:15:18.580 --> 05:15:22.200]   Ron Wilson ran, if you look in the newspaper,
[05:15:22.200 --> 05:15:25.080]   it says it's like a $100 million Ponzi scheme,
[05:15:25.080 --> 05:15:27.320]   but really it was $57 million.
[05:15:27.320 --> 05:15:29.600]   So he had lost 57 million.
[05:15:29.600 --> 05:15:32.400]   So it says 100, you know, they always exaggerate
[05:15:32.400 --> 05:15:34.400]   'cause 57 is not enough.
[05:15:34.400 --> 05:15:38.540]   Ron ended up getting 19 and a half years.
[05:15:38.540 --> 05:15:43.540]   Ron was an old con man, early '60s, '62, '61, I don't know.
[05:15:43.540 --> 05:15:48.360]   And Ron, and I liked Ron.
[05:15:48.360 --> 05:15:54.760]   So we're walking around the compound and he's like,
[05:15:54.760 --> 05:15:55.600]   "So what are you gonna do?
[05:15:55.600 --> 05:15:57.840]   I mean, you got like eight or nine more years to go."
[05:15:57.840 --> 05:15:59.820]   And I was like, eh, you know, I'm gonna keep writing.
[05:15:59.820 --> 05:16:00.980]   And when I get out of here,
[05:16:00.980 --> 05:16:02.640]   maybe I'll have a huge body of work
[05:16:02.640 --> 05:16:04.180]   and maybe I'll be able to sell it
[05:16:04.180 --> 05:16:05.940]   or maybe I'll be able to option some more stuff.
[05:16:05.940 --> 05:16:07.500]   And if I could get together with Rolling Stone
[05:16:07.500 --> 05:16:09.180]   or get with some of these magazines,
[05:16:09.180 --> 05:16:11.220]   I could start writing for them and I could option those.
[05:16:11.220 --> 05:16:13.500]   Maybe I could walk out of here with something.
[05:16:13.500 --> 05:16:15.580]   So, right, right, right.
[05:16:15.580 --> 05:16:18.900]   So Ron was, who'd only been locked up like a year or so,
[05:16:18.900 --> 05:16:22.840]   he was cooperating with the Secret Service in his case
[05:16:22.840 --> 05:16:25.300]   against some of his co-defendants.
[05:16:25.300 --> 05:16:27.940]   So he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating.
[05:16:27.940 --> 05:16:30.600]   He's actually thinking he might get brought back
[05:16:30.600 --> 05:16:32.500]   to have to testify at a trial.
[05:16:32.500 --> 05:16:36.540]   We're talking and we're walking.
[05:16:36.540 --> 05:16:39.180]   And he keeps saying, "You know, even if I,
[05:16:39.180 --> 05:16:42.460]   even if they charge those guys and even if this happens,
[05:16:42.460 --> 05:16:43.620]   they're not gonna reduce my sentence.
[05:16:43.620 --> 05:16:45.700]   They're not gonna cut my sentence."
[05:16:45.700 --> 05:16:46.540]   And, you know, first of all,
[05:16:46.540 --> 05:16:48.540]   well, probably because you stole a bunch of money
[05:16:48.540 --> 05:16:50.780]   from pension funds and churches.
[05:16:50.780 --> 05:16:53.820]   That didn't help your case, but I don't say that.
[05:16:53.820 --> 05:16:57.220]   So I say, "Oh, they have to, bro, they'll have to.
[05:16:57.220 --> 05:16:58.500]   They've, you know, if you cooperate,
[05:16:58.500 --> 05:16:59.340]   they're gonna have you.
[05:16:59.340 --> 05:17:02.800]   If you don't, we'll have Frank file a 2255."
[05:17:02.800 --> 05:17:06.140]   And he's like, "Ah, that crazy."
[05:17:06.140 --> 05:17:07.660]   So he says, "Okay."
[05:17:07.660 --> 05:17:09.380]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, you don't understand.
[05:17:09.380 --> 05:17:10.220]   You don't understand."
[05:17:10.220 --> 05:17:13.700]   So this goes on for months and I'm like,
[05:17:13.700 --> 05:17:14.820]   "What is the problem?"
[05:17:14.820 --> 05:17:17.820]   And he says, "You know, they think I hid Ponzi scheme money."
[05:17:17.820 --> 05:17:19.620]   You know?
[05:17:19.620 --> 05:17:23.020]   And he'd actually dug up like five or $6 million
[05:17:23.020 --> 05:17:25.060]   in Ponzi scheme proceeds that he dug.
[05:17:25.060 --> 05:17:28.160]   He buried in these-
[05:17:28.160 --> 05:17:29.000]   - Oh, literally.
[05:17:29.000 --> 05:17:33.860]   - Literally buried in aluminum ammunition canisters.
[05:17:33.860 --> 05:17:35.300]   A super interesting guy.
[05:17:35.300 --> 05:17:38.800]   So he actually went and dug them up and gave them to him.
[05:17:38.800 --> 05:17:40.380]   And I'm like, "Well, you gave him all the money.
[05:17:40.380 --> 05:17:41.220]   You didn't hide anything.
[05:17:41.220 --> 05:17:42.260]   Relax, it's not a big deal.
[05:17:42.260 --> 05:17:44.420]   They're not gonna find anything, so don't worry about it."
[05:17:44.420 --> 05:17:46.860]   And so he mentions it a couple of weeks later,
[05:17:46.860 --> 05:17:47.700]   a couple of weeks later.
[05:17:47.700 --> 05:17:48.520]   And then one day I go,
[05:17:48.520 --> 05:17:50.760]   "Bro, why do you keep bringing this up?
[05:17:50.760 --> 05:17:53.540]   Like, what are you concerned about?
[05:17:53.540 --> 05:17:54.380]   It's not gonna happen."
[05:17:54.680 --> 05:17:59.680]   And he said, "Can I trust you?"
[05:17:59.680 --> 05:18:01.820]   And I went, "Probably not."
[05:18:01.820 --> 05:18:06.820]   And he goes, "I did hide some money."
[05:18:06.820 --> 05:18:08.680]   I was like, "Okay."
[05:18:08.680 --> 05:18:11.280]   I said, "Did you bury it in a can somewhere?"
[05:18:11.280 --> 05:18:12.120]   And he's like, "No."
[05:18:12.120 --> 05:18:17.120]   He said, "I gave my wife like 150,000 in cash."
[05:18:17.120 --> 05:18:19.760]   I said, "Okay, well, she's not gonna say anything.
[05:18:19.760 --> 05:18:20.600]   She's using it."
[05:18:20.600 --> 05:18:21.600]   He said, "No, you don't understand.
[05:18:21.600 --> 05:18:24.620]   Since then, she found out I was having an affair.
[05:18:24.620 --> 05:18:28.560]   And we're gonna get a divorce, and she hates me.
[05:18:28.560 --> 05:18:30.840]   And I think she'll turn that money in
[05:18:30.840 --> 05:18:33.200]   just to make sure that I don't get a reduction.
[05:18:33.200 --> 05:18:35.840]   'Cause if you lie to the FBI,
[05:18:35.840 --> 05:18:37.400]   they're not gonna, it doesn't matter what you've done
[05:18:37.400 --> 05:18:39.260]   for them, they won't give you anything."
[05:18:39.260 --> 05:18:41.360]   And so he's, I mean, I'm sorry, it's Secret Service,
[05:18:41.360 --> 05:18:44.960]   or anybody, he has clearly lied to the Secret Service
[05:18:44.960 --> 05:18:45.780]   at this point.
[05:18:45.780 --> 05:18:48.480]   If she goes and says, "This is what he gave me."
[05:18:48.480 --> 05:18:51.120]   So he's like, I was like, "Oh, wow."
[05:18:51.120 --> 05:18:51.960]   And he's like, "And I gave my,
[05:18:51.960 --> 05:18:54.400]   my brother's holding maybe 30,000 for me."
[05:18:54.400 --> 05:19:00.840]   And at that moment, I was like, "Wow.
[05:19:00.840 --> 05:19:03.080]   Like this poor guy."
[05:19:03.080 --> 05:19:04.360]   No, that's not what I thought at all.
[05:19:04.360 --> 05:19:05.200]   What I thought was,
[05:19:05.200 --> 05:19:07.900]   "Is that enough to get me a sentence reduction?"
[05:19:07.900 --> 05:19:10.000]   - You son of a bitch.
[05:19:10.000 --> 05:19:11.680]   (laughing)
[05:19:11.680 --> 05:19:13.000]   - And I went, and I sat there.
[05:19:13.000 --> 05:19:13.840]   And you know what I thought?
[05:19:13.840 --> 05:19:15.520]   I thought, I did, I thought, "No."
[05:19:15.520 --> 05:19:16.680]   I thought, "That's not enough.
[05:19:16.680 --> 05:19:17.960]   That's not enough, it's nothing.
[05:19:17.960 --> 05:19:19.720]   That's not even $200,000."
[05:19:20.240 --> 05:19:21.800]   And they didn't wanna give me a reduction.
[05:19:21.800 --> 05:19:25.900]   My prosecutor was pissed that I got seven years off.
[05:19:25.900 --> 05:19:27.880]   She wanted me to get 30 months.
[05:19:27.880 --> 05:19:29.160]   She's not gonna give me anything.
[05:19:29.160 --> 05:19:31.280]   It's up to her, she's not gonna do it.
[05:19:31.280 --> 05:19:35.200]   So I go, I lay down, I go to bed.
[05:19:35.200 --> 05:19:38.640]   Like a month later, I'm on the phone with my lawyer,
[05:19:38.640 --> 05:19:40.600]   'cause I had written, remember I wrote,
[05:19:40.600 --> 05:19:43.480]   I had a manuscript for my book.
[05:19:43.480 --> 05:19:44.960]   And I wanted to put some of the stuff
[05:19:44.960 --> 05:19:48.060]   that was said in my sentencing in the book.
[05:19:49.120 --> 05:19:52.800]   So I was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts.
[05:19:52.800 --> 05:19:53.640]   And she hadn't done it.
[05:19:53.640 --> 05:19:55.040]   So I called her and I said, "Listen,
[05:19:55.040 --> 05:19:56.100]   you said you were gonna," she's like,
[05:19:56.100 --> 05:19:57.880]   "Oh God, man, I'm so sorry, I'm so busy.
[05:19:57.880 --> 05:19:59.240]   I'll do it, I'll do it."
[05:19:59.240 --> 05:20:01.080]   And then she went, this is Esther.
[05:20:01.080 --> 05:20:03.780]   She goes, "So what else is going on in there?"
[05:20:03.780 --> 05:20:05.200]   And this, she never wanted to talk to me.
[05:20:05.200 --> 05:20:07.480]   Like she didn't, you know, when they were paying her,
[05:20:07.480 --> 05:20:08.680]   she didn't wanna talk to me.
[05:20:08.680 --> 05:20:10.480]   And I was like, "What do you mean?"
[05:20:10.480 --> 05:20:12.360]   "Nothing, I just need my transcripts."
[05:20:12.360 --> 05:20:14.020]   And she's like, "Nothing's happening?
[05:20:14.020 --> 05:20:14.860]   There's nothing you wanna talk about?"
[05:20:14.860 --> 05:20:18.700]   And I was like, and I went, "You know what?
[05:20:19.700 --> 05:20:20.540]   You know what?
[05:20:20.540 --> 05:20:22.780]   There's something weird happened there.
[05:20:22.780 --> 05:20:24.620]   Listen to this."
[05:20:24.620 --> 05:20:26.780]   And I told her about Ron Wilson.
[05:20:26.780 --> 05:20:27.620]   And she goes, "Hold on."
[05:20:27.620 --> 05:20:29.540]   And she looks him up on the computer.
[05:20:29.540 --> 05:20:31.460]   She goes, "Oh, wow, this is a bad guy.
[05:20:31.460 --> 05:20:32.560]   This is a bad guy.
[05:20:32.560 --> 05:20:36.100]   And he told you, then you know where it is?"
[05:20:36.100 --> 05:20:38.660]   "Absolutely, and I can tell you exactly."
[05:20:38.660 --> 05:20:40.140]   And she goes, "Okay, okay, okay."
[05:20:40.140 --> 05:20:41.400]   She goes, "Let me look into this."
[05:20:41.400 --> 05:20:42.240]   I go, "Okay."
[05:20:42.240 --> 05:20:45.660]   So a week later, a CO comes to me and goes, "Hey, Cox."
[05:20:45.660 --> 05:20:46.500]   And I go, "What's up?"
[05:20:46.500 --> 05:20:47.620]   He goes, "Listen, at the next move,"
[05:20:47.620 --> 05:20:49.500]   'cause you know they have controlled moves.
[05:20:49.500 --> 05:20:50.900]   "All the doors are locked,
[05:20:50.900 --> 05:20:52.100]   and they open them up for 10 minutes
[05:20:52.100 --> 05:20:55.140]   so you can run to the chow hall,
[05:20:55.140 --> 05:20:57.260]   or you can run to the, you can't run though,
[05:20:57.260 --> 05:20:59.780]   no running on the compound, but you can walk fast."
[05:20:59.780 --> 05:21:03.940]   Yes, to the rec yard, or the library, whatever.
[05:21:03.940 --> 05:21:07.900]   He says, "At the next move, go to SIS," you know?
[05:21:07.900 --> 05:21:09.660]   So I go to SIS on the next move.
[05:21:09.660 --> 05:21:11.740]   But I was used to going there, by the way,
[05:21:11.740 --> 05:21:13.500]   because I was constantly ordering
[05:21:13.500 --> 05:21:15.900]   Freedom of Information Acts, and they would,
[05:21:15.900 --> 05:21:17.660]   so I'd order, you're an inmate,
[05:21:17.660 --> 05:21:19.180]   and I'd order, I'm writing a story for you,
[05:21:19.180 --> 05:21:20.900]   and I'd order it, and they'd send it to me,
[05:21:20.900 --> 05:21:22.060]   and then they would catch it, and they'd be like,
[05:21:22.060 --> 05:21:26.660]   "Why are you getting Lex's information?"
[05:21:26.660 --> 05:21:27.700]   So they'd call me down there, and I'd go,
[05:21:27.700 --> 05:21:30.660]   "No, I ordered it for him, and I'm writing a story."
[05:21:30.660 --> 05:21:32.020]   And I'd already been in Rolling Stone,
[05:21:32.020 --> 05:21:33.380]   and they'd be like, "What's the story?"
[05:21:33.380 --> 05:21:34.220]   And I'd tell them the story,
[05:21:34.220 --> 05:21:35.980]   "Hey, that's a pretty good story, here."
[05:21:35.980 --> 05:21:38.980]   And so I go down there, but this is different.
[05:21:38.980 --> 05:21:40.140]   This, the guy answers the door,
[05:21:40.140 --> 05:21:41.480]   and this guy, they call him Bulldog.
[05:21:41.480 --> 05:21:42.820]   He was a real asshole.
[05:21:42.820 --> 05:21:45.200]   He was a lieutenant at SIS, and he's like,
[05:21:45.200 --> 05:21:47.500]   "Come here, get in here, cock, sit down."
[05:21:47.500 --> 05:21:48.640]   And he dials the phone, and he goes,
[05:21:48.640 --> 05:21:49.620]   "Here, you gotta talk to this guy."
[05:21:49.620 --> 05:21:50.460]   And I'm like, "What?"
[05:21:50.460 --> 05:21:52.100]   And I pick up the phone, I'm like, "Hello?"
[05:21:52.100 --> 05:21:54.020]   And the guy goes, "Hey, this is Agent Griffin
[05:21:54.020 --> 05:21:55.200]   "with the Secret Service.
[05:21:55.200 --> 05:21:56.800]   "I understand you know where Ron Wilson
[05:21:56.800 --> 05:21:59.660]   "has hidden Ponzi scheme money."
[05:21:59.660 --> 05:22:00.500]   I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[05:22:00.500 --> 05:22:02.220]   "I want something in writing.
[05:22:02.220 --> 05:22:04.580]   "I want," you know, so I start doing that,
[05:22:04.580 --> 05:22:05.420]   and they go, "Okay."
[05:22:05.420 --> 05:22:07.140]   And I get his email address,
[05:22:07.140 --> 05:22:09.620]   and we start emailing each other back and forth.
[05:22:09.620 --> 05:22:11.740]   And he ends up getting a letter
[05:22:11.740 --> 05:22:16.740]   from the U.S. attorney in South Carolina
[05:22:16.740 --> 05:22:20.760]   that says they will consider substantial assistance
[05:22:20.760 --> 05:22:24.240]   if they make arrests or recover
[05:22:24.240 --> 05:22:26.660]   a substantial amount of money.
[05:22:26.660 --> 05:22:29.040]   That's the best I'm gonna get, is consider.
[05:22:29.040 --> 05:22:31.280]   So I start talking to this guy,
[05:22:31.280 --> 05:22:34.040]   and he starts asking me questions about Ron Wilson.
[05:22:34.040 --> 05:22:36.520]   Like, "Hey, ask him this, ask him this."
[05:22:36.520 --> 05:22:37.880]   So I'm like, "Bro, I gotta kinda work that
[05:22:37.880 --> 05:22:38.720]   "into a conversation.
[05:22:38.720 --> 05:22:40.080]   "That's an odd thing to ask."
[05:22:40.080 --> 05:22:42.300]   So this goes on for six months.
[05:22:42.300 --> 05:22:45.180]   So I'm asking questions, and I'm typing up little reports,
[05:22:45.180 --> 05:22:47.940]   and I'm a prison snitch now.
[05:22:47.940 --> 05:22:49.920]   So I'm not just, like, cooperating.
[05:22:49.920 --> 05:22:51.420]   I'm now, I'm a prison snitch.
[05:22:51.420 --> 05:22:54.300]   So I've moved down.
[05:22:54.300 --> 05:22:55.660]   I've moved down, actually,
[05:22:55.660 --> 05:22:58.300]   from being just a cooperating witness or--
[05:22:58.300 --> 05:22:59.540]   - Because you're in prison?
[05:22:59.540 --> 05:23:00.380]   - Yes. - Is that what makes
[05:23:00.380 --> 05:23:01.380]   you a prison snitch? - Prison snitch.
[05:23:01.380 --> 05:23:02.740]   You can't even really say,
[05:23:02.740 --> 05:23:05.980]   no, you could say prison rat.
[05:23:05.980 --> 05:23:06.820]   You could say prison rat.
[05:23:06.820 --> 05:23:08.740]   I think prison snitch,
[05:23:08.740 --> 05:23:11.200]   I think that's probably the closer to the term
[05:23:11.200 --> 05:23:12.360]   that most guys would use.
[05:23:12.360 --> 05:23:14.400]   - What's the difference between a snitch and a rat in prison?
[05:23:14.400 --> 05:23:15.720]   - I'm not sure.
[05:23:15.720 --> 05:23:17.120]   It rolls off the tongue better.
[05:23:17.120 --> 05:23:19.760]   Prison rat doesn't sound as good as prison snitch.
[05:23:19.760 --> 05:23:21.040]   I don't know.
[05:23:21.040 --> 05:23:22.960]   I don't spend a lot of time thinking about this.
[05:23:22.960 --> 05:23:27.960]   So what happens is I'm asking Wilson questions periodically,
[05:23:27.960 --> 05:23:33.520]   and at some point, they contact me,
[05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:37.580]   and they say, "Listen, Wilson's about to get some bad news."
[05:23:38.680 --> 05:23:39.640]   And I go, "Okay."
[05:23:39.640 --> 05:23:43.180]   And they go, he's like,
[05:23:43.180 --> 05:23:45.080]   "I don't wanna tell you what it is.
[05:23:45.080 --> 05:23:46.400]   "Let us know what happens."
[05:23:46.400 --> 05:23:47.460]   It's like two days go by,
[05:23:47.460 --> 05:23:50.360]   and one day, Wilson comes up to me one day,
[05:23:50.360 --> 05:23:52.880]   and says, "Cox, Cox."
[05:23:52.880 --> 05:23:54.280]   And I'm like, "Oh, shit."
[05:23:54.280 --> 05:23:55.960]   I'm like, "Hey, what's up?"
[05:23:55.960 --> 05:23:57.600]   And he's like, "Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
[05:23:57.600 --> 05:23:59.280]   "I got indicted."
[05:23:59.280 --> 05:24:00.700]   I was like, "What?
[05:24:00.700 --> 05:24:01.960]   "What happened?"
[05:24:01.960 --> 05:24:03.000]   (whistles)
[05:24:03.000 --> 05:24:08.000]   "No, yeah, my wife, they questioned my wife and my brother,
[05:24:09.000 --> 05:24:11.220]   "and my wife walked in.
[05:24:11.220 --> 05:24:12.660]   "First, she said, 'I don't have nothing.
[05:24:12.660 --> 05:24:14.200]   "'I don't know what you're talking about.'
[05:24:14.200 --> 05:24:15.580]   "The next day, the brother walks in
[05:24:15.580 --> 05:24:20.580]   "and gives them $150,000 in cash."
[05:24:20.580 --> 05:24:25.820]   And so the next day, the wife comes back
[05:24:25.820 --> 05:24:28.280]   and gives him $250,000 in cash
[05:24:28.280 --> 05:24:33.280]   and a bunch of silver, like gold bullion and silver,
[05:24:33.280 --> 05:24:37.500]   'cause his Ponzi scheme was based off of silver.
[05:24:38.460 --> 05:24:40.680]   He was gonna invest in silver for you.
[05:24:40.680 --> 05:24:43.760]   So half a million dollars.
[05:24:43.760 --> 05:24:44.600]   They turn over half a million.
[05:24:44.600 --> 05:24:45.620]   I'm like, "Half a million dollars?
[05:24:45.620 --> 05:24:47.500]   "I thought she was like 100,000 or something."
[05:24:47.500 --> 05:24:48.800]   And he was like, "I know.
[05:24:48.800 --> 05:24:49.980]   "I didn't know I could trust you."
[05:24:49.980 --> 05:24:53.400]   I'm like, "Ron, what are you doing?
[05:24:53.400 --> 05:24:54.820]   "I thought we were..."
[05:24:54.820 --> 05:24:58.020]   So I'll tell you something.
[05:24:58.020 --> 05:25:00.300]   Just for the icing on the cake, by the way.
[05:25:00.300 --> 05:25:01.140]   The icing on the cake.
[05:25:01.140 --> 05:25:02.560]   Let me explain one more thing.
[05:25:05.180 --> 05:25:08.600]   So if somebody cooperates with the federal government,
[05:25:08.600 --> 05:25:11.240]   let's say I get arrested and they go,
[05:25:11.240 --> 05:25:12.180]   "You wanna help yourself?"
[05:25:12.180 --> 05:25:13.660]   And you go, "Yeah, okay.
[05:25:13.660 --> 05:25:16.800]   "Look, Jimmy, he lives next to me
[05:25:16.800 --> 05:25:19.340]   "and he's running a meth house, a meth lab, whatever."
[05:25:19.340 --> 05:25:22.300]   And they go and they raid Jimmy and he gets arrested.
[05:25:22.300 --> 05:25:23.740]   You're gonna get something off of that.
[05:25:23.740 --> 05:25:25.840]   Not a lot, but you're gonna get something.
[05:25:25.840 --> 05:25:31.160]   And they could just say, "We were gonna bust him anyway.
[05:25:31.160 --> 05:25:33.220]   "We were already onto him."
[05:25:33.220 --> 05:25:36.380]   Now the next level would be you wear a wire.
[05:25:36.380 --> 05:25:41.220]   So I wore a wire and I was in danger.
[05:25:41.220 --> 05:25:43.100]   Now keep in mind, I'm asking this guy questions
[05:25:43.100 --> 05:25:44.520]   inside federal prison.
[05:25:44.520 --> 05:25:46.020]   I'm in danger.
[05:25:46.020 --> 05:25:48.820]   So whatever, that's like the next level.
[05:25:48.820 --> 05:25:53.820]   You're taking an active participation in the investigation.
[05:25:53.820 --> 05:25:58.840]   And the third level would be you actually get on the stand
[05:25:58.840 --> 05:26:02.820]   and you cooperate and you testify.
[05:26:02.820 --> 05:26:05.020]   Now there's no better cooperation than that.
[05:26:05.020 --> 05:26:09.660]   So when Wilson says to me,
[05:26:09.660 --> 05:26:13.600]   "They're gonna move me back to South Carolina.
[05:26:13.600 --> 05:26:15.060]   "They've indicted me.
[05:26:15.060 --> 05:26:16.540]   "They've charged me.
[05:26:16.540 --> 05:26:17.500]   "What do you think I should do?"
[05:26:17.500 --> 05:26:19.580]   And I go, "I think you should go to trial."
[05:26:19.580 --> 05:26:24.260]   Because I know they'll have to call me as a witness.
[05:26:24.260 --> 05:26:28.100]   Just to let you know, 'cause I don't want you to,
[05:26:28.100 --> 05:26:31.660]   I don't wanna walk out of here and have you feeling like,
[05:26:31.660 --> 05:26:35.500]   "Hey, there's some good to this guy."
[05:26:35.500 --> 05:26:40.140]   So I'm ready to cut Wilson like a fish.
[05:26:40.140 --> 05:26:41.540]   - But you are putting yourself in danger
[05:26:41.540 --> 05:26:42.660]   if you get on the stand, right?
[05:26:42.660 --> 05:26:43.640]   - I'm already in danger.
[05:26:43.640 --> 05:26:45.420]   If people there heard what I was doing,
[05:26:45.420 --> 05:26:46.580]   I probably would have been in--
[05:26:46.580 --> 05:26:49.780]   - Does that increase the chance of them hearing or no?
[05:26:49.780 --> 05:26:52.940]   - It does, but it also increases my ability
[05:26:52.940 --> 05:26:55.460]   to get more off my sentence.
[05:26:55.460 --> 05:26:58.180]   So what happens is, a couple days later,
[05:26:58.180 --> 05:26:59.860]   he's on what's called the packout, right?
[05:26:59.860 --> 05:27:01.300]   They're gonna move him.
[05:27:01.300 --> 05:27:02.140]   Maybe a week later.
[05:27:02.140 --> 05:27:04.100]   So they come and get him, they move him.
[05:27:04.100 --> 05:27:08.540]   He gets back there to South Carolina and he pleads guilty.
[05:27:08.540 --> 05:27:11.900]   They sentence him, he gets six months added on.
[05:27:11.900 --> 05:27:14.220]   So he's now from 19 1/2 to 20 years.
[05:27:14.220 --> 05:27:20.060]   And by the way, when COVID hit, he was released.
[05:27:20.060 --> 05:27:23.860]   So he only ended up doing six years on a 20-year sentence
[05:27:23.860 --> 05:27:26.460]   because he was older.
[05:27:26.460 --> 05:27:29.140]   By that point, he's 66, 67 years old.
[05:27:30.420 --> 05:27:32.500]   Anybody older than 55 was endangered,
[05:27:32.500 --> 05:27:33.820]   especially in the prison.
[05:27:33.820 --> 05:27:36.340]   So they had a COVID thing where they were releasing
[05:27:36.340 --> 05:27:38.020]   these guys and sending them home on ankle monitors.
[05:27:38.020 --> 05:27:41.020]   Like he's an old man, he's not gonna hurt.
[05:27:41.020 --> 05:27:42.400]   He's not a danger.
[05:27:42.400 --> 05:27:44.340]   So they sent him home.
[05:27:44.340 --> 05:27:46.180]   So he ended up doing, so he didn't even serve
[05:27:46.180 --> 05:27:48.840]   the six months, he didn't even serve the original sentence.
[05:27:48.840 --> 05:27:50.620]   Whatever, not that I care.
[05:27:50.620 --> 05:27:53.580]   So I'm just saying, if it makes you feel like poor Ron,
[05:27:53.580 --> 05:27:54.420]   it's okay.
[05:27:54.420 --> 05:27:58.580]   So his wife got like a hundred years,
[05:27:58.580 --> 05:28:01.100]   she got like a hundred hours of community service
[05:28:01.100 --> 05:28:02.940]   or something, or 60 hours.
[05:28:02.940 --> 05:28:05.220]   And I think his brother got six months papers.
[05:28:05.220 --> 05:28:08.080]   They got charged with obstruction of justice.
[05:28:08.080 --> 05:28:09.780]   And they didn't, neither one of them,
[05:28:09.780 --> 05:28:14.020]   it's like six months probation and community service,
[05:28:14.020 --> 05:28:15.380]   nothing.
[05:28:15.380 --> 05:28:19.700]   So when I turn around, I'm waiting for my reduction.
[05:28:19.700 --> 05:28:21.980]   Waiting, waiting.
[05:28:21.980 --> 05:28:24.620]   After about 90 days, after this guy gets sentenced,
[05:28:24.620 --> 05:28:26.140]   maybe six months, I send a letter.
[05:28:26.140 --> 05:28:28.460]   Hey, what's going on to the prosecuting,
[05:28:28.460 --> 05:28:32.220]   to my prosecutor, the prosecutor of both districts,
[05:28:32.220 --> 05:28:33.700]   no response.
[05:28:33.700 --> 05:28:35.340]   Then I go to Frank, I explained to Frank,
[05:28:35.340 --> 05:28:37.940]   and Frank has known what's going on the whole time.
[05:28:37.940 --> 05:28:40.460]   And Frank goes, okay, I'm gonna file a 2255.
[05:28:40.460 --> 05:28:42.880]   So we file a 2255.
[05:28:42.880 --> 05:28:45.780]   Government comes back and the first thing they say is,
[05:28:45.780 --> 05:28:49.020]   your honor, we don't know about any cooperation.
[05:28:49.020 --> 05:28:51.660]   We've never heard about any cooperation.
[05:28:51.660 --> 05:28:54.740]   So of course, then we submit the letter that we have.
[05:28:55.740 --> 05:28:59.180]   The judge comes back and the judge ends up saying,
[05:28:59.180 --> 05:29:01.380]   it's a little complicated, but he ends up saying,
[05:29:01.380 --> 05:29:04.540]   look, I don't have jurisdiction to hear this
[05:29:04.540 --> 05:29:09.180]   because you may be time barred.
[05:29:09.180 --> 05:29:15.260]   But I'm gonna let the appeals court hear it.
[05:29:15.260 --> 05:29:19.060]   Now, typically you have to get what's called
[05:29:19.060 --> 05:29:21.880]   like a right of certification to appeal.
[05:29:21.880 --> 05:29:24.060]   You have to make sure that you actually have a case.
[05:29:24.060 --> 05:29:25.620]   He says, I'm waiving the cert
[05:29:25.620 --> 05:29:31.180]   and I'm waiving the $500 fee to file with them.
[05:29:31.180 --> 05:29:34.800]   He said, and he basically expedites it for me,
[05:29:34.800 --> 05:29:38.540]   which is a subtle way of telling the prosecutor,
[05:29:38.540 --> 05:29:41.940]   I think he's got something and I'm sending it up there.
[05:29:41.940 --> 05:29:43.540]   And the way he writes his motion,
[05:29:43.540 --> 05:29:46.740]   it's basically saying I don't have the jurisdiction
[05:29:46.740 --> 05:29:49.920]   to hear it, to do anything, but they do.
[05:29:49.920 --> 05:29:50.900]   They need to do it.
[05:29:50.900 --> 05:29:52.640]   And I'm paving the way.
[05:29:52.640 --> 05:29:53.740]   You don't have to pay any money
[05:29:53.740 --> 05:29:55.660]   and you don't need that cert.
[05:29:55.660 --> 05:29:58.260]   So the prosecution immediately comes back.
[05:29:58.260 --> 05:30:01.020]   They file a one level reduction
[05:30:01.020 --> 05:30:06.260]   and we immediately, Frank files something saying,
[05:30:06.260 --> 05:30:09.540]   hey, stop, we don't want the reduction.
[05:30:09.540 --> 05:30:10.360]   We don't want the one level.
[05:30:10.360 --> 05:30:11.980]   We wanna come back to court.
[05:30:11.980 --> 05:30:14.000]   Please don't rule on it.
[05:30:14.000 --> 05:30:16.980]   So the judge says, okay, I'm freezing everything.
[05:30:16.980 --> 05:30:18.820]   I'm putting a stay on everything.
[05:30:18.820 --> 05:30:20.420]   I'm gonna give this guy a lawyer
[05:30:22.660 --> 05:30:25.260]   to try and figure out what you're gonna do.
[05:30:25.260 --> 05:30:30.260]   They fly down a lawyer, Leanne Weber.
[05:30:30.260 --> 05:30:34.340]   So she comes in and she comes and sees me.
[05:30:34.340 --> 05:30:38.220]   And she says, listen, I see that you wanna go back
[05:30:38.220 --> 05:30:40.420]   and fight this and this, but honestly,
[05:30:40.420 --> 05:30:41.580]   I don't think you're gonna get anything
[05:30:41.580 --> 05:30:43.580]   more than one level.
[05:30:43.580 --> 05:30:45.620]   I talked to the prosecution.
[05:30:45.620 --> 05:30:48.260]   They said they'll give you what she said.
[05:30:48.260 --> 05:30:49.900]   I can work on trying to get you two levels,
[05:30:49.900 --> 05:30:51.620]   but you don't have much of a prayer.
[05:30:51.620 --> 05:30:53.220]   You're gonna get crushed.
[05:30:53.220 --> 05:30:57.180]   And I said, well, then why are you here?
[05:30:57.180 --> 05:31:00.060]   If they can crush me so easy, why don't they do it?
[05:31:00.060 --> 05:31:01.460]   Why would they pay you?
[05:31:01.460 --> 05:31:03.420]   They pay them like 12 grand or something
[05:31:03.420 --> 05:31:08.300]   just to fly down and all your expenses to negotiate for me.
[05:31:08.300 --> 05:31:09.180]   Why not crush me?
[05:31:09.180 --> 05:31:12.260]   And she's like, I don't know.
[05:31:12.260 --> 05:31:14.540]   I said, well, Frank said four levels.
[05:31:14.540 --> 05:31:15.440]   And she's like, who's Frank?
[05:31:15.440 --> 05:31:16.540]   I go, Frank's the guy that wrote all this.
[05:31:16.540 --> 05:31:18.220]   And she's like, oh, is he an attorney?
[05:31:18.220 --> 05:31:19.320]   And I go, is he in here?
[05:31:19.320 --> 05:31:20.660]   I'm like, yeah, he's in here.
[05:31:20.660 --> 05:31:21.660]   She's like, why is he in here?
[05:31:21.660 --> 05:31:24.820]   And I tell her, he was taking over the world.
[05:31:24.820 --> 05:31:29.020]   And she says, that's the strangest thing
[05:31:29.020 --> 05:31:31.180]   I've ever heard in my entire life.
[05:31:31.180 --> 05:31:32.540]   And I said, I understand.
[05:31:32.540 --> 05:31:33.740]   But Frank said, and she's like,
[05:31:33.740 --> 05:31:35.940]   you're listening to an incompetent.
[05:31:35.940 --> 05:31:38.340]   You know, I'm like, absolutely.
[05:31:38.340 --> 05:31:42.780]   And Frank said, we want four levels.
[05:31:42.780 --> 05:31:45.420]   He said for me to tell you, we want four levels.
[05:31:45.420 --> 05:31:46.260]   She goes, okay.
[05:31:46.260 --> 05:31:47.820]   She leaves.
[05:31:47.820 --> 05:31:50.920]   She goes to the U.S. attorney, we argue two levels.
[05:31:50.920 --> 05:31:52.180]   They come back and say two levels.
[05:31:52.180 --> 05:31:53.560]   No, we go back and forth.
[05:31:53.560 --> 05:31:56.220]   We start filing motions saying we want to go back.
[05:31:56.220 --> 05:31:57.340]   We want a hearing.
[05:31:57.340 --> 05:31:59.300]   We want to bring back all the FBI agents,
[05:31:59.300 --> 05:32:00.540]   the Secret Service agents.
[05:32:00.540 --> 05:32:01.660]   And she's like, what do you want to turn this
[05:32:01.660 --> 05:32:02.500]   into a circus?
[05:32:02.500 --> 05:32:03.320]   Exactly what I want to do.
[05:32:03.320 --> 05:32:04.540]   I'm gonna turn it into the biggest circus
[05:32:04.540 --> 05:32:06.220]   'cause I've already got one level.
[05:32:06.220 --> 05:32:08.240]   They come back one day.
[05:32:08.240 --> 05:32:10.920]   She says, listen, three levels
[05:32:10.920 --> 05:32:12.420]   is the best you're gonna get.
[05:32:12.420 --> 05:32:16.280]   She said, so I guess you'll be moved back here.
[05:32:16.280 --> 05:32:17.120]   We'll go to the hearing.
[05:32:17.120 --> 05:32:19.260]   She said, no, no, no, I'll take three levels.
[05:32:19.260 --> 05:32:20.100]   And she goes, what are you talking?
[05:32:20.100 --> 05:32:21.380]   She said, you said four levels.
[05:32:21.380 --> 05:32:23.300]   You said Frank wouldn't let you take anything less than four.
[05:32:23.300 --> 05:32:26.180]   I said, no, Frank said to tell you four.
[05:32:26.180 --> 05:32:27.260]   I was happy with three.
[05:32:27.260 --> 05:32:28.580]   I wanted you to argue for four.
[05:32:28.580 --> 05:32:29.780]   I'm good with three.
[05:32:29.780 --> 05:32:31.940]   I'm out of here in like a year.
[05:32:31.940 --> 05:32:34.580]   So, and I don't wanna be moved back.
[05:32:34.580 --> 05:32:35.660]   I don't wanna have to get on that bus.
[05:32:35.660 --> 05:32:37.100]   Do you know what it's like to be moved?
[05:32:37.100 --> 05:32:37.940]   It's horrible.
[05:32:37.940 --> 05:32:39.700]   So I said, I just want the three levels.
[05:32:39.700 --> 05:32:41.580]   So then we argue about the wording
[05:32:41.580 --> 05:32:43.740]   for about two, three months, and then they file it.
[05:32:43.740 --> 05:32:45.900]   And then I get five years knocked off my sentence
[05:32:45.900 --> 05:32:48.480]   because three levels at the level I was at now
[05:32:48.480 --> 05:32:49.320]   isn't seven years.
[05:32:49.320 --> 05:32:51.160]   Every level, you get a little less time.
[05:32:51.160 --> 05:32:52.400]   So I get five years off.
[05:32:52.400 --> 05:32:55.320]   So now I've got 12 years knocked off my sentence.
[05:32:55.320 --> 05:33:00.320]   At this point, I may have a year and a half to go.
[05:33:00.320 --> 05:33:03.540]   And you know, that's doable.
[05:33:03.540 --> 05:33:08.420]   So I was super, super happy.
[05:33:08.420 --> 05:33:13.060]   And I'm gonna tell you something.
[05:33:15.600 --> 05:33:16.700]   And I'm sorry, bro.
[05:33:16.700 --> 05:33:20.120]   But every time I think about it,
[05:33:20.120 --> 05:33:23.180]   and I just feel like I have to say it.
[05:33:23.180 --> 05:33:29.880]   Like, Frank, I'm gonna, insane.
[05:33:29.880 --> 05:33:36.100]   But I can, like, I didn't have a fucking prayer
[05:33:36.100 --> 05:33:37.880]   without that guy.
[05:33:37.880 --> 05:33:40.960]   And as crazy as he is, and much of a pain in the ass
[05:33:40.960 --> 05:33:45.960]   as he was, like, I could never repay him, bro.
[05:33:45.960 --> 05:33:50.640]   Like, I'm not, I shouldn't be here.
[05:33:50.640 --> 05:33:53.400]   I'm supposed to be in prison right now.
[05:33:53.400 --> 05:33:58.400]   My out date was 30, was 2030 without that guy.
[05:33:58.400 --> 05:34:01.360]   - Where is he now?
[05:34:01.360 --> 05:34:03.080]   - He got himself out.
[05:34:03.080 --> 05:34:04.120]   He didn't do all that time.
[05:34:04.120 --> 05:34:05.120]   He got himself out.
[05:34:05.120 --> 05:34:06.080]   I don't even know how he did it.
[05:34:06.080 --> 05:34:08.760]   They even threw him back in prison again for six months.
[05:34:08.760 --> 05:34:10.800]   And he got himself out again.
[05:34:10.800 --> 05:34:12.440]   He's insane, he's incredible.
[05:34:12.440 --> 05:34:13.960]   He's insane, but he's incredible.
[05:34:13.960 --> 05:34:15.000]   - Is he really that insane?
[05:34:15.000 --> 05:34:16.180]   - He's in Orlando.
[05:34:16.180 --> 05:34:21.440]   - I mean, he seems like a good lawyer and a good man.
[05:34:21.440 --> 05:34:26.280]   - He's great, he's great.
[05:34:26.280 --> 05:34:28.520]   I mean, there's no doubt in my mind
[05:34:28.520 --> 05:34:31.000]   I would be in prison right now if it wasn't for him.
[05:34:31.000 --> 05:34:32.320]   - And he's done this for others?
[05:34:32.320 --> 05:34:34.680]   - Walk people right out, 10 years off, five years off,
[05:34:34.680 --> 05:34:35.880]   nine years off, 10 years.
[05:34:35.880 --> 05:34:40.440]   I mean, I didn't pay, and I didn't pay for one thing.
[05:34:40.440 --> 05:34:42.920]   I didn't pay for my stamps.
[05:34:42.920 --> 05:34:44.080]   He paid for everything.
[05:34:44.080 --> 05:34:48.320]   - Sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe
[05:34:48.320 --> 05:34:49.920]   it's possible, and he does.
[05:34:49.920 --> 05:34:50.880]   It's interesting.
[05:34:50.880 --> 05:34:53.440]   - Well, I think he was willing to,
[05:34:53.440 --> 05:34:56.520]   he's willing to badger them into doing
[05:34:56.520 --> 05:35:00.040]   what they should have done to begin with.
[05:35:00.040 --> 05:35:02.960]   I actually wrote a book about it, which he loved.
[05:35:02.960 --> 05:35:03.800]   - About him?
[05:35:03.800 --> 05:35:05.400]   - About him and his story.
[05:35:05.400 --> 05:35:08.700]   It's so over the top, what happened with him.
[05:35:09.600 --> 05:35:11.940]   I mean, literally tried to take over the Congo.
[05:35:11.940 --> 05:35:14.960]   I mean, there's a documentary about it.
[05:35:14.960 --> 05:35:16.920]   It's called Nine Days in the Congo.
[05:35:16.920 --> 05:35:18.560]   It's an insane story.
[05:35:18.560 --> 05:35:20.040]   That's one of those stories that's just like,
[05:35:20.040 --> 05:35:21.280]   how is this not a movie?
[05:35:21.280 --> 05:35:22.120]   - It's not a movie yet?
[05:35:22.120 --> 05:35:25.140]   - No, I don't, I've pitched it several times,
[05:35:25.140 --> 05:35:29.080]   and it would be great.
[05:35:29.080 --> 05:35:32.080]   So I wrote a synopsis, and I turned that into a book.
[05:35:32.080 --> 05:35:33.080]   - What's the name of the book?
[05:35:33.080 --> 05:35:34.420]   - Oh, It's Insanity.
[05:35:34.420 --> 05:35:35.260]   - It's Insanity.
[05:35:35.260 --> 05:35:37.960]   - Yeah, but about it, like a year and a half later,
[05:35:37.960 --> 05:35:39.360]   like I ended up getting out of prison,
[05:35:39.360 --> 05:35:40.760]   and I went to the halfway house.
[05:35:40.760 --> 05:35:43.040]   - What'd that feel like, freedom?
[05:35:43.040 --> 05:35:48.040]   - I was, oh, this is bad, bro, this is bad.
[05:35:48.040 --> 05:35:53.780]   I remember when I was leaving the prison.
[05:35:53.780 --> 05:35:57.000]   So I met some great guys in prison,
[05:35:57.000 --> 05:35:59.160]   which is a weird thing to say,
[05:35:59.160 --> 05:36:04.160]   but I've met better, I met better people in prison
[05:36:04.160 --> 05:36:08.020]   than I'd ever met outside prison at that low.
[05:36:08.900 --> 05:36:12.420]   I mean, because it was the first time
[05:36:12.420 --> 05:36:15.420]   I actually had friends, you know?
[05:36:15.420 --> 05:36:18.580]   Like I really had someone that wanted to hang out with me,
[05:36:18.580 --> 05:36:21.700]   just like, I didn't have anything to offer them.
[05:36:21.700 --> 05:36:24.820]   I can't make you any money, I can't do anything for you.
[05:36:24.820 --> 05:36:26.940]   We just hang out because we like to laugh,
[05:36:26.940 --> 05:36:28.220]   or we have things in common,
[05:36:28.220 --> 05:36:29.740]   or we're fascinated by each other,
[05:36:29.740 --> 05:36:32.380]   or we just have good time and fun.
[05:36:32.380 --> 05:36:36.060]   So when I was leaving, I remember my mom showed up,
[05:36:36.060 --> 05:36:38.840]   and my brother showed up, and they picked me up,
[05:36:38.840 --> 05:36:40.340]   and we were driving off.
[05:36:40.340 --> 05:36:44.140]   I remember looking back at the prison,
[05:36:44.140 --> 05:36:46.860]   and my brother said, "Paul, I'll bet you're glad
[05:36:46.860 --> 05:36:50.980]   "to see that, to leave that behind you."
[05:36:50.980 --> 05:36:53.300]   And I started crying.
[05:36:53.300 --> 05:36:56.300]   It's like nobody talked, I was so uncomfortable.
[05:36:56.300 --> 05:36:57.860]   It was just, I started crying,
[05:36:57.860 --> 05:37:02.420]   and it wasn't because I was like, oh, it's over.
[05:37:02.420 --> 05:37:05.180]   It was because, it was like survivor's guilt, you know?
[05:37:05.180 --> 05:37:08.660]   Like, I was leaving all of my friends,
[05:37:08.660 --> 05:37:12.280]   and I felt so bad that I was leaving them.
[05:37:12.280 --> 05:37:20.380]   But I went to the halfway house, and I had,
[05:37:20.380 --> 05:37:27.340]   I had four, I had, so when I was getting out,
[05:37:27.340 --> 05:37:34.220]   I remember joking that I had exhausted my True Links account,
[05:37:34.220 --> 05:37:36.420]   my inmate account.
[05:37:36.420 --> 05:37:37.260]   I'd exhausted it.
[05:37:37.260 --> 05:37:39.120]   I had nothing, I had like 18 cents.
[05:37:39.120 --> 05:37:40.900]   I couldn't even figure out how to spend it.
[05:37:40.900 --> 05:37:43.700]   And they give you a debit card when you leave.
[05:37:43.700 --> 05:37:46.780]   And I said, like, and they charge you
[05:37:46.780 --> 05:37:49.220]   every time you use the card.
[05:37:49.220 --> 05:37:51.660]   Like, I don't even have enough to spend the 18 cents,
[05:37:51.660 --> 05:37:53.580]   'cause the charge is like $3.
[05:37:53.580 --> 05:37:55.060]   So I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:37:55.060 --> 05:37:56.900]   I was like, I wonder if they'll still give me my debit card.
[05:37:56.900 --> 05:37:57.860]   And I'm laughing.
[05:37:57.860 --> 05:37:58.980]   Everybody's like, what are you gonna eat?
[05:37:58.980 --> 05:38:00.340]   What are you, this, what are that?
[05:38:00.340 --> 05:38:04.760]   And my one buddy looked at me, and he was like,
[05:38:04.760 --> 05:38:07.980]   you can't go to the halfway house with nothing, bro.
[05:38:07.980 --> 05:38:09.500]   And I was like, no, it's cool.
[05:38:09.500 --> 05:38:10.420]   I said, no, it's cool.
[05:38:10.420 --> 05:38:11.240]   You know, I said, no, it's cool.
[05:38:11.240 --> 05:38:13.860]   I said, I wanna start at the bottom.
[05:38:13.860 --> 05:38:15.380]   I've got that coming.
[05:38:15.380 --> 05:38:18.100]   I got working at McDonald's coming,
[05:38:18.100 --> 05:38:19.940]   so I'm gonna work at McDonald's.
[05:38:19.940 --> 05:38:21.660]   I don't give a fuck.
[05:38:21.660 --> 05:38:25.700]   And he was like, well, I think you're gonna need to buy
[05:38:25.700 --> 05:38:27.780]   clothes, I think, I said, no, it's, I said,
[05:38:27.780 --> 05:38:31.600]   it's at the, it's at the Goodwill.
[05:38:31.600 --> 05:38:33.420]   They'll give you a bunch of, they give you a bunch of crap
[05:38:33.420 --> 05:38:35.300]   if you don't have anything, if you're indigent.
[05:38:35.300 --> 05:38:36.860]   And I said, I'm indigent.
[05:38:36.860 --> 05:38:41.460]   And a couple days before I'm leaving,
[05:38:41.460 --> 05:38:43.380]   $400 ends up on my account.
[05:38:43.380 --> 05:38:46.380]   And I was like, what the fuck?
[05:38:46.380 --> 05:38:49.540]   And it was from a buddy of mine.
[05:38:49.540 --> 05:38:53.700]   And I go to him, my buddy, Tommy, and I was like,
[05:38:53.700 --> 05:38:56.040]   Tommy, did you put $400 on my account?
[05:38:57.060 --> 05:39:00.620]   And he said, I can't let you go for it with nothing, bro.
[05:39:00.620 --> 05:39:05.620]   So, I get to the halfway house and I go to Walmart
[05:39:05.620 --> 05:39:09.860]   and I buy $300 worth of clothes at Walmart.
[05:39:09.860 --> 05:39:12.060]   I've never been in a Walmart.
[05:39:12.060 --> 05:39:13.980]   I go to a Supermarket, it's huge.
[05:39:13.980 --> 05:39:16.060]   And I go there and I buy a bunch of clothes
[05:39:16.060 --> 05:39:18.020]   and I buy about 300 bucks worth of clothes.
[05:39:18.020 --> 05:39:19.540]   And I still have some of the blue jeans.
[05:39:19.540 --> 05:39:22.340]   To this day, I still wear some of the blue jeans.
[05:39:22.340 --> 05:39:26.200]   And I stayed in the halfway house
[05:39:26.200 --> 05:39:31.200]   and I called a buddy of mine named Trion, Trion Calta.
[05:39:31.200 --> 05:39:35.660]   And he owns a gym and I grew up with him.
[05:39:35.660 --> 05:39:37.860]   His whole family, they owned a bunch of gyms.
[05:39:37.860 --> 05:39:40.180]   And I called him and I said,
[05:39:40.180 --> 05:39:41.580]   hey man, I'm in the halfway house.
[05:39:41.580 --> 05:39:44.100]   And he was like, hey, what's going on?
[05:39:44.100 --> 05:39:45.740]   He said, can I do anything for you?
[05:39:45.740 --> 05:39:48.660]   And I was like, I mean, I need a job.
[05:39:48.660 --> 05:39:49.820]   I didn't think he was gonna give me a job.
[05:39:49.820 --> 05:39:52.140]   He was, bro, you're hired, I'll give you a job.
[05:39:52.140 --> 05:39:54.260]   He's like, minimum wage.
[05:39:54.260 --> 05:39:56.540]   I said, that's fine, if I can stay out of here,
[05:39:56.540 --> 05:39:58.500]   I either work like 80 hours a week.
[05:39:58.500 --> 05:40:00.100]   I was like, if I can just stay out of here 80 hours
[05:40:00.100 --> 05:40:03.540]   and you pay me minimum wage, he goes, oh hell yeah, perfect.
[05:40:03.540 --> 05:40:06.380]   So I'm at the gym and I got free reign.
[05:40:06.380 --> 05:40:09.220]   So I'm playing on my computer, goofing off all day.
[05:40:09.220 --> 05:40:11.340]   And my buddy Pete, who's still locked up,
[05:40:11.340 --> 05:40:13.340]   he's texting me and calling me and he's like,
[05:40:13.340 --> 05:40:15.860]   not texting me, he's emailing me
[05:40:15.860 --> 05:40:16.940]   through the CoreLink system.
[05:40:16.940 --> 05:40:20.060]   And he calls me periodically, he's like,
[05:40:20.060 --> 05:40:21.420]   have you started a website?
[05:40:21.420 --> 05:40:23.100]   'Cause one of the things I was gonna do when I got out
[05:40:23.100 --> 05:40:24.340]   was I was gonna start a website
[05:40:24.340 --> 05:40:26.380]   with all these stories that I'd written.
[05:40:26.380 --> 05:40:30.740]   And I was like, no, Pete, I can't, I don't have a computer.
[05:40:30.740 --> 05:40:32.740]   He's like, well, how much is a computer?
[05:40:32.740 --> 05:40:35.580]   I was like, I don't know, they're like 300 bucks.
[05:40:35.580 --> 05:40:38.220]   I was like, I said, I could probably get a used Apple,
[05:40:38.220 --> 05:40:40.820]   like MacBook, like a five-year-old MacBook or something,
[05:40:40.820 --> 05:40:44.420]   I don't know, for like $350, whatever.
[05:40:44.420 --> 05:40:45.700]   And I said, but he was like,
[05:40:45.700 --> 05:40:46.980]   okay, so that's all you need, 300 bucks.
[05:40:46.980 --> 05:40:48.860]   I go, no, no, no, no, I said, it's not 300 bucks, bro.
[05:40:48.860 --> 05:40:52.700]   It's 300 bucks, plus it's getting a WordPress website,
[05:40:52.700 --> 05:40:53.980]   which I said costs money,
[05:40:53.980 --> 05:40:56.380]   plus it's hiring somebody to help me figure it out
[05:40:56.380 --> 05:41:01.380]   because I'm inept, I don't know how anything works.
[05:41:01.380 --> 05:41:05.900]   So he, okay, and I said, plus I need this,
[05:41:05.900 --> 05:41:08.000]   plus I need that, I need a bunch of stuff.
[05:41:08.000 --> 05:41:12.260]   I need $600 for this, I need 300 for this,
[05:41:12.260 --> 05:41:16.180]   I need 500 for this, I need $1,000 for this.
[05:41:16.180 --> 05:41:18.180]   And he goes, okay, he said, I'll get you,
[05:41:18.180 --> 05:41:19.020]   okay, I got it.
[05:41:19.020 --> 05:41:21.220]   So he reads off a list, he goes, I gotcha.
[05:41:21.220 --> 05:41:23.060]   But Pete doesn't have any money.
[05:41:23.060 --> 05:41:24.180]   And I go, how are you gonna give me any money?
[05:41:24.180 --> 05:41:29.180]   He goes, every day I walk across the compound,
[05:41:29.180 --> 05:41:33.220]   some people stop me and say, how's Cox doing?
[05:41:33.220 --> 05:41:34.780]   And I say, oh, he's okay.
[05:41:34.780 --> 05:41:37.380]   And they say, does he need anything?
[05:41:37.380 --> 05:41:39.460]   And I say, no, no, he's good.
[05:41:39.460 --> 05:41:41.180]   He said, I'm gonna start telling these fuckers,
[05:41:41.180 --> 05:41:42.900]   yeah, yeah, he needs something.
[05:41:42.900 --> 05:41:44.100]   You wanna do something for him?
[05:41:44.100 --> 05:41:45.140]   Here's what he needs.
[05:41:47.500 --> 05:41:52.120]   I ended up getting two laptops sent to me.
[05:41:52.120 --> 05:41:57.940]   I got the computer program, Final Cut Pro.
[05:41:57.940 --> 05:42:03.460]   I had guys in prison cutting me checks
[05:42:03.460 --> 05:42:05.460]   so that I could build a website
[05:42:05.460 --> 05:42:08.300]   and put all these stories on the website.
[05:42:08.300 --> 05:42:09.140]   So I start putting the website,
[05:42:09.140 --> 05:42:10.620]   and I don't know what I'm doing, man.
[05:42:10.620 --> 05:42:12.860]   I mean, I put them on the website,
[05:42:12.860 --> 05:42:16.980]   slowly, it takes forever, putting pictures up,
[05:42:16.980 --> 05:42:21.540]   I'm trying to figure out how Photoshop works,
[05:42:21.540 --> 05:42:23.080]   how all this stuff.
[05:42:23.080 --> 05:42:26.220]   The whole time I wanted to start,
[05:42:26.220 --> 05:42:28.060]   'cause the last one, I was just getting out of prison,
[05:42:28.060 --> 05:42:29.020]   everybody kept telling me like,
[05:42:29.020 --> 05:42:30.220]   bro, you gotta start a podcast,
[05:42:30.220 --> 05:42:32.460]   you gotta start a true crime podcast.
[05:42:32.460 --> 05:42:34.300]   And I don't know what a podcast is.
[05:42:34.300 --> 05:42:37.540]   The term podcast came into existence in 2009
[05:42:37.540 --> 05:42:39.620]   when I'd been locked up three years.
[05:42:39.620 --> 05:42:41.620]   I'd never been on YouTube.
[05:42:41.620 --> 05:42:46.060]   So by the time I get out, the last year or two,
[05:42:46.060 --> 05:42:47.900]   guys are coming up to me, giving me magazines,
[05:42:47.900 --> 05:42:49.740]   like this is what a pod, you need to read.
[05:42:49.740 --> 05:42:51.780]   Look, true crime's huge.
[05:42:51.780 --> 05:42:52.620]   And you have to think,
[05:42:52.620 --> 05:42:54.380]   guys are asking me every couple of days,
[05:42:54.380 --> 05:42:56.180]   Cox, you got any stories?
[05:42:56.180 --> 05:42:57.260]   And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:42:57.260 --> 05:42:59.100]   Did you read Cash and Coke?
[05:42:59.100 --> 05:43:02.220]   And they're like, is that the one where the guys
[05:43:02.220 --> 05:43:03.420]   are robbing the drug dealer?
[05:43:03.420 --> 05:43:05.180]   Yeah, oh no, I read that one.
[05:43:05.180 --> 05:43:06.020]   Did you read this one?
[05:43:06.020 --> 05:43:07.420]   No, no, I haven't read that, that's the one with the guy.
[05:43:07.420 --> 05:43:08.620]   And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:43:08.620 --> 05:43:10.540]   So I'm giving these little stories,
[05:43:10.540 --> 05:43:12.780]   and then they'd come back and give them to me.
[05:43:12.780 --> 05:43:14.880]   You don't have anything in there, right?
[05:43:14.880 --> 05:43:17.940]   So this is, guys that would never read in their life
[05:43:17.940 --> 05:43:19.180]   are reading.
[05:43:19.180 --> 05:43:24.180]   And I'm writing about the guy in B2, the guy in C1.
[05:43:24.180 --> 05:43:28.340]   So I put up the whole thing.
[05:43:28.340 --> 05:43:29.900]   And they're, well, anyway, they're all telling me,
[05:43:29.900 --> 05:43:31.700]   do a true crime podcast, true crime podcast.
[05:43:31.700 --> 05:43:32.640]   I don't really know what that is.
[05:43:32.640 --> 05:43:35.260]   But by now, I'm starting to listen to them on YouTube,
[05:43:35.260 --> 05:43:38.780]   you know, serial and cold case files,
[05:43:38.780 --> 05:43:40.540]   you know, that kind of stuff.
[05:43:40.540 --> 05:43:41.900]   And I think that's what I wanna do.
[05:43:41.920 --> 05:43:45.280]   Well, my buddy Treon says there's a guy named Danny Jones
[05:43:45.280 --> 05:43:48.300]   that runs a podcast called Concrete,
[05:43:48.300 --> 05:43:50.040]   and it's in St. Petersburg.
[05:43:50.040 --> 05:43:51.980]   And he lives a couple miles from me.
[05:43:51.980 --> 05:43:53.920]   I see him all the time.
[05:43:53.920 --> 05:43:55.960]   And I went, okay.
[05:43:55.960 --> 05:43:57.800]   And he said, you should email him.
[05:43:57.800 --> 05:44:00.080]   He's got a guy on there all the time that does real estate.
[05:44:00.080 --> 05:44:02.960]   And I go, I just got out of prison for bank fraud
[05:44:02.960 --> 05:44:03.960]   related to real estate.
[05:44:03.960 --> 05:44:05.920]   He doesn't wanna interview me.
[05:44:05.920 --> 05:44:07.960]   He goes, well, you could, maybe he does.
[05:44:07.960 --> 05:44:10.400]   Maybe you could ask him about starting a podcast.
[05:44:10.420 --> 05:44:12.780]   And I go, okay.
[05:44:12.780 --> 05:44:14.820]   So I sent him an email.
[05:44:14.820 --> 05:44:17.140]   I remember Danny called me and he said,
[05:44:17.140 --> 05:44:17.980]   hey, is this Matt Costa?
[05:44:17.980 --> 05:44:19.220]   I was like, yeah, this is Matt.
[05:44:19.220 --> 05:44:20.060]   He's like, I got your email.
[05:44:20.060 --> 05:44:20.900]   This is Danny Jones.
[05:44:20.900 --> 05:44:21.860]   And I was like, okay.
[05:44:21.860 --> 05:44:26.060]   And he says, yeah, I got your email, bro.
[05:44:26.060 --> 05:44:27.780]   He was like, that's a good fucking email.
[05:44:27.780 --> 05:44:29.500]   And I was like, what?
[05:44:29.500 --> 05:44:31.140]   He goes, I get a lot of emails, bro.
[05:44:31.140 --> 05:44:33.140]   He said, that's a good one.
[05:44:33.140 --> 05:44:33.980]   That was really good.
[05:44:33.980 --> 05:44:35.780]   Like, I mean, that was well-written.
[05:44:35.780 --> 05:44:38.780]   He's like, I immediately knew I had to talk to you.
[05:44:38.780 --> 05:44:39.980]   And I said, oh, okay.
[05:44:39.980 --> 05:44:42.360]   I said, 'cause I started off with,
[05:44:42.360 --> 05:44:44.360]   I think I started off with, hey, my name's Matt Cox
[05:44:44.360 --> 05:44:45.300]   and I'm a con man.
[05:44:45.300 --> 05:44:48.300]   It was recently released from federal prison.
[05:44:48.300 --> 05:44:50.960]   And so he was like, oh yeah, I mean, who says that?
[05:44:50.960 --> 05:44:54.160]   So anyway, he said, well, what's going on?
[05:44:54.160 --> 05:44:55.720]   I said, well, and I tell him what's going on.
[05:44:55.720 --> 05:44:57.160]   I wanna start a podcast, blah, blah, blah.
[05:44:57.160 --> 05:45:00.480]   And Danny, he listens to me for 30 minutes to an hour
[05:45:00.480 --> 05:45:01.600]   and I've heard this and this.
[05:45:01.600 --> 05:45:03.280]   And he's like, yeah, right.
[05:45:03.280 --> 05:45:04.720]   YouTube's not really like that.
[05:45:04.720 --> 05:45:06.120]   And that's not really how we do it.
[05:45:06.120 --> 05:45:08.120]   And I don't know that you're gonna have to get
[05:45:08.120 --> 05:45:09.760]   a production company and blah, blah, blah.
[05:45:09.760 --> 05:45:11.680]   He goes, but you know what?
[05:45:11.680 --> 05:45:13.400]   What you really need to do is to see if people
[05:45:13.400 --> 05:45:15.560]   are even interested in you or your story
[05:45:15.560 --> 05:45:16.800]   or you're able to talk.
[05:45:16.800 --> 05:45:19.720]   You should come on my show.
[05:45:19.720 --> 05:45:22.120]   Shameless, trying to get some content.
[05:45:22.120 --> 05:45:24.560]   - Well, I mean, so as I told you offline,
[05:45:24.560 --> 05:45:26.720]   Danny and Concrete Podcast is really good.
[05:45:26.720 --> 05:45:28.280]   So people should definitely listen to it.
[05:45:28.280 --> 05:45:29.120]   - Yeah.
[05:45:29.120 --> 05:45:32.060]   - Yeah, I mean, it turns out people do like listening to you.
[05:45:32.060 --> 05:45:32.900]   - Turns out.
[05:45:32.900 --> 05:45:35.520]   - I mean, you're good at telling stories.
[05:45:35.520 --> 05:45:37.920]   - Well, anyway, by the time I got it,
[05:45:37.920 --> 05:45:38.760]   I couldn't do Danny's podcast.
[05:45:38.760 --> 05:45:39.760]   I was like, I can't do it, bro.
[05:45:39.760 --> 05:45:40.600]   I'm in the halfway house.
[05:45:40.600 --> 05:45:43.680]   So maybe I get out of the halfway house
[05:45:43.680 --> 05:45:44.960]   and a couple of months go by,
[05:45:44.960 --> 05:45:47.500]   just maybe two months, three months go by.
[05:45:47.500 --> 05:45:49.240]   And one day I get a phone call from Danny.
[05:45:49.240 --> 05:45:50.680]   He's like, bro, you're out of the halfway house, right?
[05:45:50.680 --> 05:45:52.280]   And I was like, 'cause I told him I got out in July.
[05:45:52.280 --> 05:45:53.840]   It was like October, November.
[05:45:53.840 --> 05:45:54.920]   I'm like, right?
[05:45:54.920 --> 05:45:57.200]   He's like, listen, I had a guest fall through.
[05:45:57.200 --> 05:45:59.000]   I got nobody.
[05:45:59.000 --> 05:45:59.960]   I need you to come on.
[05:45:59.960 --> 05:46:02.200]   I answered all your questions.
[05:46:02.200 --> 05:46:05.480]   You know, I'd call them five, six times, you know.
[05:46:05.480 --> 05:46:08.180]   I asked, you said, and I was like, ah.
[05:46:08.940 --> 05:46:11.540]   I was like, fuck it, I'll do it.
[05:46:11.540 --> 05:46:14.020]   That video got like a two million views.
[05:46:14.020 --> 05:46:16.860]   Then I did Patrick Bet David Flew Me Out.
[05:46:16.860 --> 05:46:19.460]   Then I did Soft White Underbelly.
[05:46:19.460 --> 05:46:20.460]   You know, then I did Vlad.
[05:46:20.460 --> 05:46:22.100]   Then I did all, like people started,
[05:46:22.100 --> 05:46:24.860]   and I'm sorry, and then, you know, it just blew up.
[05:46:24.860 --> 05:46:27.100]   And then people started asking me to come and,
[05:46:27.100 --> 05:46:30.420]   you know, talk for no reason, which was crazy.
[05:46:30.420 --> 05:46:31.380]   But you were saying, I'm sorry.
[05:46:31.380 --> 05:46:33.620]   - Is your dad still with us?
[05:46:33.620 --> 05:46:37.300]   - No, he died when I was in prison.
[05:46:38.260 --> 05:46:41.180]   He came to see me, yeah,
[05:46:41.180 --> 05:46:43.180]   he came to see me two or three times.
[05:46:43.180 --> 05:46:46.460]   - When is the first time he found out
[05:46:46.460 --> 05:46:48.900]   that you were doing fraud?
[05:46:48.900 --> 05:46:50.820]   - The first time I got in trouble.
[05:46:50.820 --> 05:46:51.660]   - When you got the probation?
[05:46:51.660 --> 05:46:52.940]   - Yeah, because I had, you know,
[05:46:52.940 --> 05:46:57.940]   I had to kind of explain that, you know,
[05:46:57.940 --> 05:47:01.340]   something's happening.
[05:47:01.340 --> 05:47:03.580]   I didn't want him to hear it from anybody else.
[05:47:03.580 --> 05:47:07.060]   - So you talked to him directly about it?
[05:47:07.060 --> 05:47:09.780]   - Super disappointed.
[05:47:09.780 --> 05:47:14.900]   - Did he ever tell you he loves you after that?
[05:47:14.900 --> 05:47:17.300]   - So after I got the 26 years,
[05:47:17.300 --> 05:47:20.260]   and the government decided they weren't going
[05:47:20.260 --> 05:47:23.860]   to indict anybody, and I really was like,
[05:47:23.860 --> 05:47:25.540]   wow, this is it, like, you're done.
[05:47:25.540 --> 05:47:28.380]   He came to see me, but just by himself.
[05:47:28.380 --> 05:47:32.460]   And I remember he, I remember when he came to see me,
[05:47:33.460 --> 05:47:36.940]   I, you know, he was by himself,
[05:47:36.940 --> 05:47:38.380]   like he never came by himself.
[05:47:38.380 --> 05:47:42.560]   So I remember thinking something happened to my mom.
[05:47:42.560 --> 05:47:43.980]   And as soon as I walked in, you know,
[05:47:43.980 --> 05:47:46.140]   he walked in, I go, where's mom?
[05:47:46.140 --> 05:47:47.980]   And he goes, oh, she's fine, she's fine.
[05:47:47.980 --> 05:47:49.780]   And he sat down with me, and he said,
[05:47:49.780 --> 05:47:53.460]   and he said, how are you doing?
[05:47:53.460 --> 05:47:55.740]   I was like, I'm good.
[05:47:55.740 --> 05:47:59.540]   And he was just like, you know, he was getting sick.
[05:47:59.540 --> 05:48:01.380]   He was getting older.
[05:48:01.380 --> 05:48:03.380]   So, you know, we talked for a little bit
[05:48:03.380 --> 05:48:05.740]   just about the situation.
[05:48:05.740 --> 05:48:06.780]   And I was like, yeah, and he's like,
[05:48:06.780 --> 05:48:07.620]   well, what are you gonna do?
[05:48:07.620 --> 05:48:09.060]   And I was like, you know, there's nothing I can do.
[05:48:09.060 --> 05:48:11.340]   Like everybody I've called, multiple attorneys,
[05:48:11.340 --> 05:48:14.140]   I've talked to people, there's nothing I can do.
[05:48:14.140 --> 05:48:18.060]   And he was like, you know, you're gonna figure it out.
[05:48:18.060 --> 05:48:24.020]   You know, he goes, he said, you're clever,
[05:48:24.020 --> 05:48:28.380]   and you're smart, and you're gonna,
[05:48:28.380 --> 05:48:32.260]   you're not gonna do all of that time.
[05:48:32.260 --> 05:48:36.900]   And I was like, I'm done, it's over.
[05:48:36.900 --> 05:48:40.860]   I'm gonna get out of here when I'm 60,
[05:48:40.860 --> 05:48:45.780]   if I behave myself, and if I don't, I'll be 64.
[05:48:45.780 --> 05:48:50.340]   And he was like, that's not gonna happen.
[05:48:50.340 --> 05:48:57.780]   And so he said,
[05:48:58.660 --> 05:49:03.460]   I think that was the first time he,
[05:49:03.460 --> 05:49:05.140]   you know, I knew he was proud of me
[05:49:05.140 --> 05:49:08.660]   when I was making money, but he never said it.
[05:49:08.660 --> 05:49:11.420]   You know, you got the look, like he was like impressed.
[05:49:11.420 --> 05:49:15.940]   But we were sitting there, and he said,
[05:49:15.940 --> 05:49:18.180]   I remember he said, 'cause it's the only time
[05:49:18.180 --> 05:49:21.200]   I can ever remember him saying he was proud of me.
[05:49:21.200 --> 05:49:26.420]   And I remember he said, you're gonna figure this out.
[05:49:26.420 --> 05:49:30.020]   He said, I'm not proud of where you ended up,
[05:49:30.020 --> 05:49:34.660]   but you've done amazing things.
[05:49:34.660 --> 05:49:36.700]   You know, he said, I wish you'd use your talents
[05:49:36.700 --> 05:49:39.300]   for something different, but you've done things
[05:49:39.300 --> 05:49:41.540]   that I could have never done.
[05:49:41.540 --> 05:49:46.240]   And you've led an amazing, adventurous life,
[05:49:46.240 --> 05:49:47.380]   and I'm proud of you.
[05:49:47.380 --> 05:49:53.140]   And that, you know, I wish he could see you now.
[05:49:55.640 --> 05:49:59.180]   My mom, I mean, my mom saw me.
[05:49:59.180 --> 05:50:01.540]   My mom's funny, 'cause my mom came to see me.
[05:50:01.540 --> 05:50:03.520]   My mom's a gangster.
[05:50:03.520 --> 05:50:10.460]   My mom came to see me every two weeks for 13 years.
[05:50:10.460 --> 05:50:12.860]   She missed about a month and a half
[05:50:12.860 --> 05:50:17.540]   when she had a stroke and ended up in a wheelchair.
[05:50:17.540 --> 05:50:19.500]   And then she came in the wheelchair,
[05:50:19.500 --> 05:50:21.500]   and she would make my brother bring her.
[05:50:21.500 --> 05:50:23.620]   My brother and sister would be like,
[05:50:23.620 --> 05:50:25.020]   mom, are you sure you wanna go?
[05:50:25.020 --> 05:50:27.900]   Like, you know, it's so hard to,
[05:50:27.900 --> 05:50:30.100]   it's such a long drive and you get so tired.
[05:50:30.100 --> 05:50:31.500]   Well, I'll sleep in the car.
[05:50:31.500 --> 05:50:35.100]   I know, but you know, then we have to wait
[05:50:35.100 --> 05:50:40.100]   in that waiting area forever, and it takes forever.
[05:50:40.100 --> 05:50:43.900]   Well, I'm in the wheelchair, so I'm fine.
[05:50:43.900 --> 05:50:47.220]   Well, I know, but it's such a pain
[05:50:47.220 --> 05:50:48.900]   to get in and out and in and out.
[05:50:48.900 --> 05:50:50.620]   And she was like, I'm going to see my son,
[05:50:50.620 --> 05:50:51.640]   and you're taking me.
[05:50:54.260 --> 05:50:59.260]   She, yeah, so I, so she, yeah, she was something else.
[05:50:59.260 --> 05:51:04.620]   And I would say, you know,
[05:51:04.620 --> 05:51:08.120]   like if I had to say,
[05:51:08.120 --> 05:51:14.980]   you know, I don't think about all the things I did
[05:51:14.980 --> 05:51:15.820]   to get out.
[05:51:15.820 --> 05:51:17.020]   Like, I know, you know, there's all these guys
[05:51:17.020 --> 05:51:19.740]   that are like, you know, oh, I wouldn't have done that,
[05:51:19.740 --> 05:51:21.220]   and I would have been a standup guy,
[05:51:21.220 --> 05:51:24.020]   and I'd have been, well, good for fucking you, bro.
[05:51:24.340 --> 05:51:25.860]   I wanted to get out.
[05:51:25.860 --> 05:51:27.180]   I wanted out.
[05:51:27.180 --> 05:51:32.020]   And the icing on the cake of me getting out,
[05:51:32.020 --> 05:51:37.500]   and I would have cut every motherfucker's head
[05:51:37.500 --> 05:51:39.140]   in that prison off.
[05:51:39.140 --> 05:51:46.740]   I was able to get out just in time
[05:51:46.740 --> 05:51:51.740]   to spend the last year and a half
[05:51:52.260 --> 05:51:54.160]   of my mother's life with her.
[05:51:54.160 --> 05:51:58.740]   I saw her two or three times a week,
[05:51:58.740 --> 05:52:00.340]   took her to dinner once a week,
[05:52:00.340 --> 05:52:06.800]   was able to go on walks with her in her wheelchair.
[05:52:06.800 --> 05:52:08.500]   I was sitting right next to her
[05:52:08.500 --> 05:52:10.700]   when she had her final stroke.
[05:52:10.700 --> 05:52:17.020]   I held her hand when she took her last breath.
[05:52:21.900 --> 05:52:26.780]   So, if I have to be called a snitch the rest of my life,
[05:52:26.780 --> 05:52:28.440]   I don't give a fuck.
[05:52:28.440 --> 05:52:33.840]   Like, I may not deserve more, but she deserved more.
[05:52:33.840 --> 05:52:36.980]   Do you regret?
[05:52:36.980 --> 05:52:41.020]   'Cause you just look back, would you do it,
[05:52:41.020 --> 05:52:43.900]   would you do any part of your life different?
[05:52:43.900 --> 05:52:46.340]   Oh, I'd scrap all this, yeah.
[05:52:46.340 --> 05:52:47.180]   Yeah.
[05:52:47.180 --> 05:52:50.580]   Yeah, I'd scrap all this to be,
[05:52:50.580 --> 05:52:52.740]   you know, you always hear these guys say,
[05:52:52.740 --> 05:52:56.260]   I wouldn't change it because it made me the man I am today.
[05:52:56.260 --> 05:53:01.260]   The man I am today is a fucking 54-year-old scumbag,
[05:53:01.260 --> 05:53:06.060]   multiple felons, starting my life over, broke,
[05:53:06.060 --> 05:53:12.580]   living off of scraps, trying to make YouTube work.
[05:53:12.580 --> 05:53:17.580]   Like, I've got two dead parents, I'm divorced,
[05:53:17.580 --> 05:53:22.580]   I have a son that doesn't talk to me.
[05:53:22.580 --> 05:53:27.900]   I have a son that doesn't talk to me for good reason,
[05:53:27.900 --> 05:53:32.900]   not because of a misunderstanding, because he understands.
[05:53:32.900 --> 05:53:36.740]   Like, you can't even argue with him,
[05:53:36.740 --> 05:53:37.980]   he's got a powerful argument.
[05:53:37.980 --> 05:53:39.580]   Like, I don't wanna be a part of this guy's life,
[05:53:39.580 --> 05:53:40.780]   he's a scumbag.
[05:53:40.780 --> 05:53:42.660]   He stole money, he went on the run,
[05:53:42.660 --> 05:53:47.060]   he abandoned me when I was, you know, three years old.
[05:53:47.060 --> 05:53:49.340]   I don't want anything to do with him.
[05:53:49.340 --> 05:53:52.900]   Like, I get it.
[05:53:52.900 --> 05:53:56.380]   Like, you know, and I've tried to do all the right things.
[05:53:56.380 --> 05:53:58.900]   You know, I wrote the letters, I drew him pictures,
[05:53:58.900 --> 05:54:00.500]   I've tried to call, and it's not happening.
[05:54:00.500 --> 05:54:04.820]   Like, I would do anything to go back
[05:54:04.820 --> 05:54:09.100]   and just be that regular middle-class guy
[05:54:09.100 --> 05:54:14.100]   with the two kids and the wife, working a regular job.
[05:54:14.500 --> 05:54:19.060]   You know, I, like, that's a good life.
[05:54:19.060 --> 05:54:20.860]   You know, that's a good person.
[05:54:20.860 --> 05:54:25.860]   And, you know, I just made one arrogant decision
[05:54:25.860 --> 05:54:30.980]   after another, after another, until it snowballed
[05:54:30.980 --> 05:54:32.900]   and I couldn't take it back.
[05:54:32.900 --> 05:54:35.180]   And then I did everything I could.
[05:54:35.180 --> 05:54:40.180]   And if I wasn't the calculating, backstabbing,
[05:54:42.660 --> 05:54:46.780]   scumbag motherfucker that I can be,
[05:54:46.780 --> 05:54:48.940]   I'd be in prison right now.
[05:54:48.940 --> 05:54:52.780]   Sorry, you know, so yeah, yeah.
[05:54:52.780 --> 05:54:55.060]   I would much rather be a CPA right now.
[05:54:55.060 --> 05:54:57.740]   I would much rather, you know,
[05:54:57.740 --> 05:54:59.740]   should have stuck with being an insurance adjuster
[05:54:59.740 --> 05:55:00.580]   or something.
[05:55:00.580 --> 05:55:03.180]   I mean, you know, I never should have whited
[05:55:03.180 --> 05:55:05.620]   that 30-day late out, never.
[05:55:05.620 --> 05:55:06.460]   It was a mistake.
[05:55:06.460 --> 05:55:07.980]   - That was your first mistake.
[05:55:07.980 --> 05:55:09.820]   - That was a huge mistake.
[05:55:09.820 --> 05:55:11.660]   - You think your son will forgive you?
[05:55:11.660 --> 05:55:16.660]   - No, unfortunately, according to my ex-wife
[05:55:16.660 --> 05:55:22.340]   and my sister and everybody, that he is a part
[05:55:22.340 --> 05:55:25.260]   of their lives, you know, and I've seen him.
[05:55:25.260 --> 05:55:28.060]   You know, my mother's funeral, I saw him.
[05:55:28.060 --> 05:55:30.580]   You know, I've seen him at several functions.
[05:55:30.580 --> 05:55:34.500]   You look across and he looks right through me.
[05:55:39.300 --> 05:55:43.900]   I think that everybody says he's just like you.
[05:55:43.900 --> 05:55:44.780]   He's just like you.
[05:55:44.780 --> 05:55:46.780]   And everybody says I'm just like my dad.
[05:55:46.780 --> 05:55:51.020]   I've never smoked a cigarette.
[05:55:51.020 --> 05:55:54.900]   I've never drank alcohol, not a drop.
[05:55:54.900 --> 05:55:59.900]   Never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic
[05:55:59.900 --> 05:56:03.820]   and my dad smoked two packs a day
[05:56:03.820 --> 05:56:07.220]   and everything in our house reeked of nicotine
[05:56:07.220 --> 05:56:08.580]   and I've never smoked.
[05:56:08.580 --> 05:56:10.180]   And my dad was a pill head.
[05:56:10.180 --> 05:56:12.780]   He was always on some kind of prescription medication.
[05:56:12.780 --> 05:56:16.420]   He was drug, you know, and I didn't wanna be that person.
[05:56:16.420 --> 05:56:20.420]   And like one day, I drew a line in the sand
[05:56:20.420 --> 05:56:21.460]   and I wouldn't do it.
[05:56:21.460 --> 05:56:25.180]   And I think he's drawn a line in the sand
[05:56:25.180 --> 05:56:28.620]   and he's decided, you know, this is the hill
[05:56:28.620 --> 05:56:31.260]   I'm gonna die on and I'm not gonna back off it.
[05:56:31.260 --> 05:56:34.940]   And the thing is, my ex-wife tells him,
[05:56:34.940 --> 05:56:38.500]   he's a good person, you should be in his life.
[05:56:38.500 --> 05:56:41.380]   His father, 'cause he was adopted.
[05:56:41.380 --> 05:56:43.580]   When I was in prison, they adopted him.
[05:56:43.580 --> 05:56:47.060]   Nick is his dad.
[05:56:47.060 --> 05:56:48.420]   Nick has told him.
[05:56:48.420 --> 05:56:50.980]   Nick came to see me when I was in prison.
[05:56:50.980 --> 05:56:54.780]   Nick has told him like, hey, this is a mistake.
[05:56:54.780 --> 05:56:56.060]   You're making a mistake.
[05:56:56.060 --> 05:56:58.420]   Everybody that knows me knows him.
[05:56:58.420 --> 05:57:00.580]   And he has said no.
[05:57:00.580 --> 05:57:02.940]   So I fully believe it's no.
[05:57:02.940 --> 05:57:04.540]   I mean, I hope it's not.
[05:57:04.540 --> 05:57:05.980]   - Well, I hope he forgives you.
[05:57:05.980 --> 05:57:08.700]   I think there's a lot of good in you,
[05:57:08.700 --> 05:57:10.740]   despite you calling yourself a scumbag
[05:57:10.740 --> 05:57:12.220]   over and over in this podcast.
[05:57:12.220 --> 05:57:14.780]   - I keep bothering you, you mentioned that earlier.
[05:57:14.780 --> 05:57:19.140]   - What advice would you give to young people,
[05:57:19.140 --> 05:57:21.780]   given that you've lived quite a non-standard life?
[05:57:21.780 --> 05:57:24.620]   What advice would you give them how to live a life
[05:57:24.620 --> 05:57:25.660]   they can be proud of?
[05:57:25.660 --> 05:57:32.420]   - I mean, I'm in a position that anybody would listen to me,
[05:57:33.660 --> 05:57:36.900]   but 'cause to me, and I don't have any advice
[05:57:36.900 --> 05:57:39.300]   that I don't think a father would give you.
[05:57:39.300 --> 05:57:42.860]   And it's like, work hard, be appreciative.
[05:57:42.860 --> 05:57:44.460]   I mean, things are so good out here.
[05:57:44.460 --> 05:57:46.420]   I hear people complain all the time.
[05:57:46.420 --> 05:57:48.420]   And I think a huge part of just being happy
[05:57:48.420 --> 05:57:49.340]   is being appreciative.
[05:57:49.340 --> 05:57:51.180]   Like I didn't appreciate anything.
[05:57:51.180 --> 05:57:52.860]   When I had, this is so cliche,
[05:57:52.860 --> 05:57:54.940]   but when I had all the money in the world,
[05:57:54.940 --> 05:57:57.220]   I was miserable.
[05:57:57.220 --> 05:58:00.260]   But when I got out with nothing,
[05:58:00.260 --> 05:58:04.860]   I was happier in prison with nothing
[05:58:04.860 --> 05:58:09.220]   than I was with two or $3 million prior to prison.
[05:58:09.220 --> 05:58:13.220]   And dating a chick, I never should have been dating.
[05:58:13.220 --> 05:58:16.500]   Driving a sports car, vacationing all over the world,
[05:58:16.500 --> 05:58:17.480]   miserable.
[05:58:17.480 --> 05:58:21.500]   I'm crying driving away from prison
[05:58:21.500 --> 05:58:23.300]   because I already missed my friends.
[05:58:23.300 --> 05:58:26.940]   You could have never told me that was gonna happen.
[05:58:26.940 --> 05:58:30.220]   - Turns out money, in fact, does not buy happiness.
[05:58:30.220 --> 05:58:32.700]   - No, and it is such a cliche, right?
[05:58:32.700 --> 05:58:34.580]   But it's so true.
[05:58:34.580 --> 05:58:37.580]   - Crying driving away from prison, yeah.
[05:58:37.580 --> 05:58:38.420]   - You know what?
[05:58:38.420 --> 05:58:43.220]   I met my wife in the halfway house.
[05:58:43.220 --> 05:58:47.560]   So she had just gotten out of prison.
[05:58:47.560 --> 05:58:48.780]   She was in the halfway house with me.
[05:58:48.780 --> 05:58:51.980]   She just did five years for like a meth conspiracy.
[05:58:51.980 --> 05:58:55.140]   I never would have met her if I hadn't gone to prison.
[05:58:55.140 --> 05:58:58.340]   - And now your date night is hunting alligators together.
[05:58:58.340 --> 05:59:01.900]   - Yeah, that was like a month or so ago.
[05:59:01.900 --> 05:59:03.340]   - This is Florida, folks.
[05:59:03.340 --> 05:59:07.760]   This is what bad-ass people do in Florida.
[05:59:07.760 --> 05:59:09.740]   - My wife-- - Hog hunting.
[05:59:09.740 --> 05:59:11.940]   - Is a former, she used to,
[05:59:11.940 --> 05:59:14.340]   so she was an MP in the military.
[05:59:14.340 --> 05:59:17.620]   She was, she did, she hunted,
[05:59:17.620 --> 05:59:22.620]   she ran a hog hunting tour guide service for six years.
[05:59:22.620 --> 05:59:26.840]   Went to prison for five years, got out,
[05:59:26.840 --> 05:59:29.780]   and then now she's a Marine mechanic.
[05:59:29.780 --> 05:59:33.620]   And yeah, our date night the other night was,
[05:59:33.620 --> 05:59:34.780]   we went in the middle of the night,
[05:59:34.780 --> 05:59:38.380]   went to Lake Okeechobee and went alligator hunting.
[05:59:38.380 --> 05:59:41.500]   - Yeah, and if I may say so, she's quite beautiful.
[05:59:41.500 --> 05:59:43.620]   - Thank you, and I did nice.
[05:59:43.620 --> 05:59:46.380]   She didn't wanna date me in the halfway house too.
[05:59:46.380 --> 05:59:48.140]   I kept saying, "I feel like you're sweet on me."
[05:59:48.140 --> 05:59:50.300]   She's like, "I'm not, I'm not.
[05:59:50.300 --> 05:59:51.700]   "I make fun of guys like you.
[05:59:51.700 --> 05:59:52.540]   "You're a city boy."
[05:59:52.540 --> 05:59:54.440]   I'm like, "I don't know, I feel like."
[05:59:54.440 --> 05:59:55.940]   - Well, you wore her down.
[05:59:55.940 --> 05:59:59.000]   - I guess that's why I did exactly what I did.
[05:59:59.000 --> 06:00:00.880]   - It's that charisma.
[06:00:00.880 --> 06:00:02.080]   It always works.
[06:00:02.080 --> 06:00:04.240]   Well, Matt, thank you for being so honest.
