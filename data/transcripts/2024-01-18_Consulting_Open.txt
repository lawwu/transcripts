[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   Hey radicals, just a quick announcement that I have opened up 31 consulting slots here
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.120]   for the month of January, for the last two weeks of January.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.820]   If you are interested in purchasing a consulting appointment, a private consulting call with
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.760]   me to talk about your financial planning or anything else that you would like to talk
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.220]   about, you can book a call now at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.760]   These usually sell out, so if you would like to book a call with me, I would encourage
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040]   you to do it sooner rather than later, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.200]   Link is in the show notes.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.960]   If you need a little bit more information, what can I do for you?
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.240]   Well, frankly, I interview for the job each and every day here on the podcast.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.800]   So if you don't think that there's something specific that I can do to help you, then just
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.360]   keep on listening to the podcast.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.600]   There's more than a thousand hours of advice and commentary and insights and live Q and
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.040]   A's, et cetera, here available for you.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.600]   One of the things that many people hire me for is technical financial planning.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.400]   I am a certified financial planner.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.560]   I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.720]   In addition to that, I am a chartered life underwriter.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.200]   That's a life insurance educational designation.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.720]   I'm a chartered financial consultant, similar financial planning education designation.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.100]   I am a chartered advisor for senior living.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.760]   That's a designation that I did with a specialty on advising retirees and post-retirees.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.520]   I'm a registered health underwriter.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.080]   It's not a designation that is offered anymore, but it's a designation that I did several
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.600]   classes on health insurance and the details of health insurance, both individual and group
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   health insurance.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000]   I'm a registered employee benefits consultant.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.320]   That's also a now defunct designation in the world of financial planning, but it has to
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.800]   do with putting in place group benefit plans, et cetera.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.400]   I'm a chartered advisor of philanthropy, and that one is a financially oriented, excuse
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.680]   me, philanthropy oriented designation that I have as well.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.000]   So I have a long list of professional certifications and have worked for many years as a professional
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.320]   financial planner.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.800]   What is unique about the financial planning services that I offer though, is that I do
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.160]   not sell any products.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.800]   I don't sell any investment products.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.160]   I don't sell any life insurance products.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.360]   I don't sell any trusts.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.640]   I don't sell anything to you except an hour of my time.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.480]   And so if you would like to speak to an independent professional, somebody who can come in, who
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.680]   can speak with you, I have frequently been able to save my clients enormous amounts of
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.960]   money by pointing them in the right direction, pointing them away from the wrong direction.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.440]   I have lots of do-it-yourselfers in my audience that hire me.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.160]   And I think that's a great bang for your buck.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.080]   If you'd like to talk to me and just say, "Hey, is there anything missing in our plan?"
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.120]   That's a great solution as well.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.680]   I'm a lot cheaper than a lot of other financial advisors, et cetera.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.800]   And usually in an hour or so, I can solve some problems pretty quickly.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   In addition to that, I do a lot of consulting and coaching on all kinds of non-technical
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   stuff.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.840]   Frequently, I have found myself doing a lot of consulting on international affairs, international
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.920]   planning, ever since that's been something that's entered into my life over the last
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   few years pretty heavily.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600]   That's been a big significant component of it.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.800]   I've done a lot of work in the area of philanthropy.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.300]   I've done a lot of work in the area of business planning, charitable planning, et cetera.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.120]   And so these are some of the ways that I can serve you.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.160]   I have hundreds and hundreds of clients.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   I've recently collected a bunch of testimonials.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   I'm going to be releasing a lot of those testimonials, but today, just one to lead off with.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.240]   Estella, when I asked for a testimonial, Estella said this, "Consulting with Joshua was insightful.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.840]   He focuses on your question, makes you think about it, and gives you a clear answer and
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.720]   direction."
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.040]   So I have hundreds and hundreds of satisfied clients.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.000]   I've had now, I think, four dissatisfied clients.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.360]   So pretty good ratio, pretty good bet that I'd be able to help you with anything that
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   you would like my services on.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.960]   To book a call today, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
