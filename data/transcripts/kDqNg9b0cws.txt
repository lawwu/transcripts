[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   One idea that I really like, I read this in the book, Where's My Flying Car?,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.080]   but that it's basically crazy that our cities are designed with roads that all intersect with each
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.120]   other. That's just a crazy way to structure a material flow problem, basically. And any sane
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.200]   city would be built with multiple layers of transportation where each one went in a different
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.320]   direction, so your flows would just be massively, massively improved. You change the way that they
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.920]   went together, you could unlock massively different cities.
