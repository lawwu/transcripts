[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.720]   >> I am so excited to introduce you to our keynote speaker tonight.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   When we were talking about who would be a great keynote,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800]   last year we had Eric Belchunas.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.100]   Many of you were there.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800]   And he was so good.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.960]   But we wanted to capture that same level of engagement, humor,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.600]   intelligence that Eric brought.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.120]   And we thought, with Alan Roth's help,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.680]   that Clark Howard would be a perfect person to be here.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.520]   So Clark is a noted consumer advocate.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.480]   He has one of the top podcasts for financial information out there,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   the Clark Howard Show.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.720]   And in a lot of ways, it's a beautiful compliment to Bogleheads, I think,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   because Bogleheads is all about, you know, sort of figuring out how
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.880]   to invest your portfolio and save money on your investments.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.960]   And Clark's work is all about how to spend in a way
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.800]   that kind of maximizes your value.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.480]   So I think it just is a perfect compliment to the investment stuff
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.200]   that we think about all the time.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.720]   Clark is going to talk for a while.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   And then he will also take your questions.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.240]   So we have a mic here.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.640]   We've been kind of holding back
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.000]   on the open mic thing during this conference.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But for this part of the event, we will take your questions.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.160]   Clark loves taking questions.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.600]   And, yeah, so, you know, if you want to hear about how to score the best deal
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.400]   on an electric vehicle or, you know, vacation in Costa Rica
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   or whatever, Clark's your guy.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   So we're looking forward to hearing from him.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.320]   Clark, if you can come on up.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.120]   Thank you.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.360]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.320]   Y'all ready for some fun?
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.960]   So it's so exciting for me to be in this room
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.360]   with people who are also frugal.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   But I will tell you, I am not frugal.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   I am cheap.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.160]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.960]   Y'all know the difference between frugal and cheap?
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   Cheap is when you'll take lower quality for a lower price.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   And that is me.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.960]   And I have had a very unusual life.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.280]   I grew up in the South.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   We didn't have child labor laws.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.880]   And when I was growing up, I'm 68.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.520]   So we really didn't when I was a kid.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.080]   And so I had my first job when I was 11.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.760]   I was working in a warehouse, not a very safe warehouse.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.560]   And I started saving money then.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.160]   And I opened Roth -- not Roth IRAs.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.720]   Traditional IRAs first came along when I was a teen.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.220]   And as soon as I could, I opened one and contributed to it.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.280]   And I grew up in Atlanta and decided that what I wanted
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.320]   to do was be a politician.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   So nobody laughed when I said that.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.240]   That was actually true.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.800]   I wanted to be a politician.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.400]   So I applied to one college, the best school in America
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.000]   for political science, Georgetown University.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.600]   Any Georgetown graduates in here?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.640]   We got one Georgetown graduate here.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.040]   I didn't apply to any other schools.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.800]   And then, this is before the internet, you got an envelope.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.440]   You either got a thick envelope or a thin one.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.120]   I got the thin one.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   I had missed the application to apply everywhere at that point.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.480]   Well, American University, just down the road
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   from here, really needed students.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.200]   And they took me.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840]   So I enrolled at American to study political science.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.160]   And when I came home from college my freshman year
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   at Thanksgiving, my dad was looking terrible, looking awful.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.640]   And we were at dinner that first night home
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.760]   from college at Thanksgiving.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.080]   And nobody was smiling.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.720]   Nobody was laughing.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   And I'm like, something's really wrong here.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.040]   And after dinner, my dad asked me to stay at the table.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.720]   And I'm like, this is it.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320]   And he said, I have something terrible to tell you.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.560]   And he said, I got fired from my job.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.080]   And I started smiling.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.320]   And he said, why are you smiling?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.240]   And I said, because I thought you were dying.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.840]   And so then he said, there's no money for you
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.880]   to go back to college in January.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.640]   And I was like, what?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.280]   Because my parents lived a really high voltage life.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.640]   I mean, really fancy life.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.920]   They figured out how to be an American
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.080]   before Americans are now, where they
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560]   lived on money they didn't have and all the rest.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.760]   And so this was one of the most important events in my life,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.640]   was what happened with my dad.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.040]   And after a few years, my parents got back on their feet.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240]   But American turned out to be the luckiest break for me,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   because most of the students at American were night students.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.960]   They worked full time and went to college at night.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.560]   So all I did was I scrambled when
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.740]   I got back those three weeks between Thanksgiving
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.480]   and Christmas, and I got a job.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.200]   And I got a job as--
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   I don't know if this term will mean anything to anybody.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   I was a GS-4 with the federal government.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.040]   Nobody's ever met a GS-4.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.760]   But I was a GS-4.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.720]   I was making $7,596--
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.120]   I'm not holding the mic close enough, am I?
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.540]   I was making $7,596 a year as a federal employee.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.840]   Well, American was $2,400 a year.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.680]   And I rented a really terrible apartment with a friend.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   And my rent was $124.50 a month.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.080]   So I was able to work full time, go to college at night,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.720]   get a degree, have not a penny of student loan debt,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.640]   and get my degree.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.680]   You can't do that now.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.520]   I mean, you go to American now, and four years is $300,000.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.720]   But back then, we didn't have all these fancy campuses
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   and all the big expense.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.440]   And so I was able to get my degree.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   But what happened was it changed me.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.560]   And I resolved I was never going to live my life
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.280]   like my parents handled money.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.520]   And something happens to you as a teenager.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.680]   I don't know if anybody in this room
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.000]   had something happen to them as a teenager.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.720]   But it changes you.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.960]   It changes you if something traumatic
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   happens when you're a teen.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.840]   And so I resolved that I was going
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.720]   to live on every other paycheck.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.760]   And so I saved, starting at 20 years old--
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.720]   because that's when I graduated from American--
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.400]   I lived on every other paycheck.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.680]   And grad school, I got paid for for free
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.600]   because I left the government.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.520]   I was a GS-5 by then, for those of you
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.600]   who know what that is.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   And I got a job at IBM as a bill collector.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.960]   And they paid for my grad school.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.920]   And I actually did OK as a bill collector,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.800]   but I hated the job.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.880]   So as soon as I finished grad school, I quit.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.160]   But anyway, I got my master's degree for nothing in business.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.440]   Because the truth is, after three years
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.680]   with the federal government, it wasn't for me.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I decided politics wasn't my thing.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.920]   But the reason I mention this is that it worked for me.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.480]   I lived on much less than what I make.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.960]   And you think about the principles
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.580]   of what so much in the culture in this room,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.560]   it is about living on less than what you make.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   I deal with consumers every day on the podcast, radio, TV,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.560]   wherever.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.040]   We do websites and all this stuff.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   And one of the biggest problems that we face
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.960]   is someone will come to us.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.880]   And the problem is, they're in debt past their eyeballs.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.960]   We just hit a record on credit card debt in the United States.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.360]   I think it's $1.1 trillion collectively
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   in credit card debt.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.880]   How are you supposed to save for a rainy day?
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.760]   How are you supposed to save for your kid's college?
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.480]   How are you supposed to save for retirement
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.880]   when you owe all that money to Visa and MasterCard
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   at the average bank interest rate now, 22%?
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.200]   Now, if you know somebody who's in credit card debt,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.760]   they need to know this.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.320]   Do you know the average interest rate
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.800]   at a credit union for a credit card is 12%?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.240]   And I've always referred to Vanguard,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.360]   to my listeners and my viewers, as a credit union
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.820]   for investing.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.280]   I've always thought of it that way,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.920]   and that's how I've always explained it.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.680]   And when you think about what it's always been about,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.280]   it's been about by and for the members.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.200]   But you know, that's only one part
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.600]   of what makes a company great.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.000]   The first part is you have to treat your employees well.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.840]   The great companies treat their employees well,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.940]   and in turn, treat their customers well.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.520]   Business is complex.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   Business can be complicated.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.680]   But when you treat your employees well
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.880]   and your customers well, even if you're
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:55.240]   in a complicated business, you will find your customers,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.320]   and they will find you.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.960]   Because you're doing the right thing,
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.000]   and you're treating your employees well.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.560]   And there are very few companies--
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.680]   it's the simplest thing in capitalism,
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.640]   enlightened self-interest.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.960]   Do right by your employees and your customers.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.760]   And I think about two companies in retail.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.920]   One of them, we have a dog named Kirkland Signature.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:33.000]   And you think I'm kidding.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   No.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.500]   The deal is my wife gets to have dogs, but I get to name them.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.000]   So we used to have a dog named Costco Wholesale,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.560]   and unfortunately, she's passed away.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.240]   So now we have Kirkland Signature.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.000]   And do you know that Kirkland Signature
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.160]   will sell $60 billion as a brand in '23,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.560]   one of the world's most successful brand names?
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.040]   It's not even a brand name.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.080]   But Costco pays their employees incredibly well,
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.720]   gives part-timers full health benefits,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   has a markup on the merchandise in the store of 14%,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.960]   unless it's Kirkland Signature, when it's 15%.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.200]   Everything they're about is value.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.080]   And they are now the third largest retailer in the world,
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.000]   I think, from nothing.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.080]   They started in 1984, or three.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.520]   And they are this monstrously large company.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.080]   And they've done it because they treat their employees well,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.800]   and they treat their customers well.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.420]   Now, I'm a Sam's Club member as well.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.720]   Do we have any Sam's Club members?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080]   Do we have any Sam's Club members that are also
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.120]   Costco members?
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.520]   Raise your hand.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:58.160]   OK, so let's take a trip down each store's checkout.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.680]   So you're in Costco, and you get the front,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.920]   and they're checking you out.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.120]   They have two people working each register,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.980]   and they're hustling.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.080]   And if they've got a price problem,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.000]   there's not a SKU, not a barcode on something,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.460]   one of those Costco people takes the item, runs back.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.720]   You tell them where you think you found it in the store.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.200]   They run back there, and they find it,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.560]   and they run back to the front.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.760]   What do they do at Sam's Club when you get to the front,
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.120]   and the item doesn't have a SKU on it, or doesn't ring up?
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.200]   They'll say, it doesn't have a SKU.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.280]   And they look at you like, what are you going to do about it?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.000]   It's got to be both.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.720]   You've got to take care of the employee
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.520]   so they can take care of the customer.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.000]   And that's the thing.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.380]   It's easy.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:55.980]   It's simple.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.800]   Business is hard.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.080]   But we make it harder in capitalism
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.840]   than we need to because we forget that.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.480]   You know, I believe that Walmart, the parent
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.280]   company of Sam's Club, is one of the greatest anti-poverty
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.600]   programs in the history of the world,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.200]   that they have the most efficient distribution
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.640]   system for consumer goods of anybody on planet Earth.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.920]   And the prices are great and all that.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.000]   But they only do half of it.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.440]   They only do half of it.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.360]   They do the pricing right.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.040]   They don't treat the employees right.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.800]   And that's why when you go to Sam's Club, which they own,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.720]   or you go to a Walmart, it's just really
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.040]   a difficult experience for the employees working there
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.600]   and the customers buying there.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   And so that's the thing.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.520]   You think about how many-- can anybody name another company
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.920]   that you think does that combination?
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.240]   Vanguard, and we've got also my Costco people, Chick-fil-A.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.080]   All right, who knows the history of why
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.200]   Chick-fil-A does a better job at their stores
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.560]   than any other fast food restaurant other than Culver's?
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.720]   If anybody knows Culver's from the Midwest?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.880]   Which custard do you like best at Culver's?
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.600]   I like the butter burger with Swiss cheese.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.560]   OK, so what is the magic--
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.080]   and this is a capitalist thing-- what
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.840]   is the magic of Chick-fil-A and Culver's?
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.760]   Who knows how they operate?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.320]   They make them better than everybody else in fast food.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.000]   And we have a mic right here.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.240]   Somebody knows the story.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.300]   They get the Sundays off.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.720]   It's not the Sundays off.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.480]   Culver's is seven days a week.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.120]   Who said it?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   Who just said it?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.640]   You said it.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.320]   Will you stand up?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.720]   Say it so everybody can hear you on the mic.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.120]   They're not franchise.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.760]   That is exactly right.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.920]   If you look at the capitalist arrangement
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.600]   between a McDonald's store like the one across here
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.360]   and McDonald's corporate in Illinois,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.920]   the franchise and the store are arch rivals with each other,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.200]   right?
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.160]   Because all McDonald's wants is they want their royalties.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.200]   And all the store wants is they want to make money.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.120]   But McDonald's is always forcing the operators
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.500]   into all these discounts they don't want to do
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.800]   and hours they have to be open.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.040]   And it's an adversarial relationship.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.840]   And now the states all have these franchise laws
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.680]   where McDonald's and all the other owners of franchises
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.880]   can't kick out a bad operator.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.480]   Chick-fil-A and Culver's, the way they do it
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.920]   is you're an operator.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   You don't have to put any money in.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.760]   You operate that store at their pleasure.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.960]   If they decide you're not performing
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.040]   or you're not treating your employees well,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.080]   you're out instantly.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:18.200]   And the employee operator and the company
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.920]   split the profits 50/50.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.880]   The interests are aligned.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:32.840]   Chick-fil-A sells something like $5.7 million per location.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.240]   A Burger King right now might do $500,000 a location.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.520]   And it's because they got the incentives right,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.880]   the motivation.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.080]   The employees are motivated to be there.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   They are treated well.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.760]   They're given college scholarship money
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.920]   if they're in high school.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.360]   This isn't hard.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.480]   You just treat people right.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.440]   And I have done it in my own life, my own business.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.640]   I have 44 employees with my company.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.280]   And what I do for my employees is each year
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.640]   I do three special things.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.720]   One, I take them on a shopping spree every Christmas
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.320]   based on our profits.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.560]   They're given money and Costco.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.240]   And they're given one hour to run around and spend it.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:33.280]   Second, I take them on a trip wherever in the world
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   I find that's on sale.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.640]   So earlier this year, we went to Singapore and Thailand
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.400]   because it was on sale.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.520]   And every year, we go wherever.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.080]   So people keep asking, where are we going on the trip in '24?
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.440]   I said, wherever goes on sale.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.240]   And so we've been to every continent except Antarctica.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.980]   We go wherever.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.080]   And they so look forward to it.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.360]   But the cool thing is their friends
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.240]   who work wherever else they work,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.960]   they tell them they're going on the trip.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.320]   And they're like, you're doing what?
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.400]   Yeah, it's something we got at work.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.480]   And they're just blown away.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   But it creates this special sense of reward.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.320]   But the third thing I do is I take
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.720]   50% of my company's profits each year,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.960]   and I pay them out to the employees.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:38.200]   And so the employees totally operate, think like owners.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.240]   When COVID hit, and it was so disruptive to so many
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.200]   businesses, and our revenue--
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.160]   because we live by ad revenue on our websites,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.280]   on our podcasts, newsletters.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.080]   All the stuff we do is all ad-supported.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.560]   Well, those of you who are in ad-supported businesses,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.640]   we were dying when COVID happened.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.760]   Not literally, thank goodness.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.560]   But anyway, financially, we were.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.920]   And there we were in April, May, June.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.600]   And suddenly, we didn't have money coming in.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.960]   My employees worked their tails off and kept working.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.320]   And the ad revenues started coming back in July
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.800]   and was fully restored by about September.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   But they weren't going anywhere because they
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.960]   believed in the mission of serving our audience.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.720]   And they also knew how they were being treated
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.360]   and that they were part of the team.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.240]   And this is the way we should be in business.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.200]   And so there's something we were talking about the other day.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   You know, in that slide earlier about Jack Bogle,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.560]   they were talking about the four giants
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.360]   of the financial industry.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.520]   Did anybody notice who the second one was?
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.240]   It was Chuck Schwab.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:18.000]   So he and Jack Bogle were, to me, the two great disruptors
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.040]   in what had been a very closed society in investing.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.480]   And Chuck Schwab's a brilliant man.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.720]   But Schwab, without him operating it day to day,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.760]   it's lost its way a little bit.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.680]   Anybody have a Schwab account?
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.840]   You're not going to get in trouble saying
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.520]   you have a Schwab account.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   So it probably looked like about a fourth of people
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.920]   have a Schwab account.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.920]   What do you earn at Schwab on your EIDL cash in your account?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.960]   0.45.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.040]   0.45%.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.400]   0.45.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.560]   What do you earn at Vanguard on your EIDL cash?
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.040]   Right now, right around upper fours to five,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.120]   depending on what you have in it, five plus.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.360]   The brilliant people running Schwab now
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.840]   decided, you know, we're going to make
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.480]   a lot of money on the spread.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   We're going to pay people.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.280]   We're going to sweep their EIDL cash into something.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.600]   We're going to pay them 0.45.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.140]   Then we're going to turn around, and we're going to lend it,
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.840]   and we're going to earn five plus percent on it.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:33.080]   And I don't know how Chuck's letting that go on,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.120]   because that's not how you treat people.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.120]   It's really so easy.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.160]   Treat people right.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.880]   And I love capitalism.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.600]   I love it.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.320]   I am a free enterpriser.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.960]   I know my kids have grown up in these situations in school
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.080]   where they've been taught that capitalists are evil
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.120]   and dishonest and all these things.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.080]   And it's not.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.040]   Capitalism is great.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.200]   And some of the decisions people make
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.320]   don't show enlightened self-interest, which is key.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   But enough about that stuff, because now it's
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.120]   time to talk about fun stuff.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.600]   I want to-- and then we're going to go to questions.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.880]   So I want to talk about travel for a second.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.240]   The travel industry suddenly is starting
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.560]   to see softness with customers.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.400]   And anybody who's traveled to Europe in the last year,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.320]   you paid a lot to go to Europe in points or dollars
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.480]   or whatever.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.000]   Now Europe's starting to soften.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.840]   I looked this afternoon.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.760]   And for travel November through February,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.240]   these fares are from New York.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.360]   But they're representative of the fares happening
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.240]   around the country.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.960]   Rome is now 420.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.480]   Lisbon, 470.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.760]   Dublin, 380.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.400]   London, 460.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.320]   And this isn't just on some really terrible airline.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.920]   It's on several terrible airlines, like American--
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:25.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.600]   --American, United, Delta, Lufthansa, British Airways,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.080]   Air Canada.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.600]   And there are sales all over the place.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.560]   And does anybody have what used to be called SkyMiles that
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.360]   are now called SkyPennies?
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.960]   So those of you with SkyPennies, Delta
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.800]   is really getting a lot of bad wave of publicity.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.720]   So they did a sale today for people with SkyMiles as coach.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.160]   But London starts at 34,000 points round trip
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.240]   from the East Coast and goes up to 59,000 on the West Coast.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.440]   People have been booking it like crazy today.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.160]   But if you have SkyPennies, try to book this,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160]   because it is such a deal.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.640]   And Delta is doing a deal with Sydney, Australia
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.920]   from the West Coast for 80,000 SkyMiles round trip.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.000]   Those are cheap deals.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.200]   In fact, I got it from my son-in-law
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.720]   for 59,000 just recently on Delta.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.880]   So the travel industry is going through a lot of disruption
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.920]   now.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.360]   And so there are a lot, a lot of deals.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.480]   But my main rule you heard me allude to earlier,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.600]   I never, ever pick a destination.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.560]   I only find a bargain, buy it, and then figure out
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   why I'm going there.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.560]   And that is absolutely the key with travel.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.960]   Because what most people do is they pick a destination
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.880]   and they say, I want to go on, I don't know, March 16.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.680]   And I got to come back March 23.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.320]   And I got to go to Paris.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   And it needs to be nonstop.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.000]   And they're like, why is it $1,650?
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   Because the more you narrow your options,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.240]   the more you're going to pay.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.620]   With travel, the more opportunistic you can be,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.880]   I promise, you'll see the whole world if you just
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.600]   buy the deals.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.440]   Now, I've gone, I'm telling you,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.880]   I've been to every continent repeatedly.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.040]   But it's always the deal that takes me there.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.680]   And so our next deal is we're going
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.000]   to Amsterdam for Thanksgiving week,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.200]   because JetBlue had Amsterdam for Thanksgiving week
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   for $399 round trip.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.920]   Now, we didn't get the $399.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.680]   We got $469.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.460]   But I mean, that's good.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:13.240]   And so you let the bargain drive what you do.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.280]   Although, I won't fly Frontier.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.560]   If Frontier paid me, maybe I would.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.240]   They've got some customer service problems.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.520]   But Spirit is, compared to Frontier,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.720]   Spirit's like going on, I don't know, on Singapore or something
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.280]   like that.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.000]   Frontier is the bottom, bottom, bottom.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.160]   Their CEO is really an interesting guy.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.320]   Anyway, but what I do with my audience,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.160]   our slogan is save more, spend less,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.360]   and avoid getting ripped off.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.240]   And what we do is we teach our audience
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.800]   how to take expenses in their lives
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.920]   and reduce them so they have money to save for their future,
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.480]   to live on less than what they make.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.680]   And I use a number of strategies.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.320]   But there are certain areas that didn't
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.560]   used to exist that now eat a meaningful chunk of people's
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.120]   life each and every month.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.880]   I see so many people with their smartphones.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.800]   And the really smart ones have Androids.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.360]   But anyway, I see so many people with smartphones.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.520]   What are you paying for your plan?
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.200]   And the reality is, we were talking about this
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.040]   over at this table.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.400]   So how many people are Verizon?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.880]   Who just said visible?
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.600]   Are you invisible?
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.440]   15 a month.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.640]   So Verizon is having to play blocker because
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.600]   of all the new discounters.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.880]   So Verizon has a discounter that I call invisible
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.440]   because they don't promote it.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.680]   It's just a defensive thing where
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.520]   you get the same Verizon branded service,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.680]   but you get it from their discounter visible
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.880]   that they own 100%.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.600]   It's just a brand name of theirs.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.560]   And what you pay Verizon $100 a month for,
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.600]   you pay visible $25 for unlimited everything.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.080]   And each of the cell phone carriers have this.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.960]   No, AT&T has Cricket.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.360]   T-Mobile has Metro.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.080]   And so they all have these blockers
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.960]   that are defensive, that are geared really
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.000]   towards people under 35.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.320]   But there's no reason any of us can't use these services.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.800]   And you're on the same exact network, same towers,
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.280]   same everything.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   And these companies are owned-- they're not companies.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.840]   They're just brand names of each of the big ones.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.080]   So there's so many things like that.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.480]   Like what's going on right now with streaming.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   I mean, the cost of streaming is going through the roof.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.840]   And so we have a tool on Clark.com
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.360]   where you can put in your favorite channel
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.200]   that you like to watch.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.760]   And it'll tell you what it's going
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.400]   to cost you per month on the cheapest streaming service
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.600]   that'll get you that.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.600]   And then you put in your second favorite channel
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.400]   and your third, and on like that.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.960]   And then you hit a point where you're like, uh-oh.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.000]   It just went from 30 a month to 70
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.280]   because I added this channel or that channel.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.000]   And so if you learn to treat money
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.200]   as a precious finite resource, and you
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   learn how to squeeze every penny, every dollar,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.640]   it's so easy.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.400]   And so that's what we're really about,
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.600]   is teaching people how to take all these things in their lives
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.800]   and do them for less.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.840]   And you don't have to do what I do,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   lower quality for a lower price.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   You can stick with good quality and still get a better price.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.760]   And I'm ready-- who wants to ask the first question at the mic?
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   Just go right back there.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.120]   Just go ahead.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.360]   And if you don't mind, say your name
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.320]   and where in the country you live,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.520]   because the geographical dispersion and diversity
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.360]   of this group is amazing, where everybody's all from.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.760]   [INAUDIBLE] from Greenville, South Carolina.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.880]   Do you have a job or an internship?
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:51.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.600]   I'm asked that a lot, actually, when people
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   hear about our travel and stuff.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.880]   By the way, this will really surprise you.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.240]   We have no turnover.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.580]   Clark, thank you so much for everything you do.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.080]   I wrote down the question.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.680]   And it is, consumer advocacy is a significant part
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.800]   of your work.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.480]   What are some of the most pressing consumer issues people
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.200]   should be aware of right now?
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.920]   So the number one thing is people getting scammed.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.640]   And the pretexting scams--
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.840]   who has not gotten an email, or a text, or a phone call
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.760]   from somebody pretending to be from Bank of America,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.240]   or Wells Fargo, or Chase, or Citi?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.360]   Or if they have cracked your identity,
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.080]   the exact financial institution you do business with.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.720]   And we're putting people on TV who've lost
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.480]   massive amounts of money.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.600]   And there's no getting the money back
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.640]   once you've been scammed by a pretext,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.280]   or pretending to be from your bank, or your brokerage,
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.320]   or from a financial house.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.000]   Thanks.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.500]   Sure.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.700]   Hi, there.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.600]   I'm Adrienne.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.160]   I used to live in Atlanta over 20 years ago.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   And I would listen to you on talk radio.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.120]   And since I moved, I've kind of lost touch with you.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   So it's really good to hear you.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.960]   And I'm going to pick up your podcast
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.400]   and start listening to them again.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:19.680]   Thank you.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.220]   Where in the country do you live now?
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.160]   I live in Arlington, Texas now.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.360]   Austin, Texas?
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.960]   Arlington, which is outside of Dallas.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.440]   Oh, OK.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.840]   My question-- since I haven't listened to you in so long,
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.440]   I don't think 0% credit cards were out back then.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.840]   But I take advantage of them now.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.440]   I was just sharing with my table there.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.480]   I use them for house renovations.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.840]   Our house is paid off, so I'll just take it and get the points.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.440]   I don't have any credit card debt.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.760]   I would be interested in hearing what
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.360]   you have to say about 0% credit cards.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.480]   If you're using them as a payment system,
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.760]   and you get it paid off within the 12 months, 18 months,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.560]   whatever, 24 of the zero, I have no problem with that.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:09.480]   That's not an issue, as long as it's a method of finance
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.080]   that you use.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.280]   The thing that's really on our radar right now
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.840]   are these pay-in-fours, the buy now, pay later.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.040]   And those are blowing up on people.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.520]   I don't get a lot of problems about what you're doing.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   I'm getting tons about pay-in-four,
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.400]   where you get to the register, or you're
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.960]   buying something online.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.840]   And they say, would you like to pay this in four easy payments?
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.160]   And pretty much a fourth of people doing that
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.800]   have ruined their credit, because they don't get
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.840]   the pay-in-four done on time.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.200]   They end up in the hands of a collection agency.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.360]   They end up with interest and penalty payments
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.720]   that they thought it was free doing the pay-in-four.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.960]   But there's no give on that.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.880]   In your case, you know you're getting six months, 12 months,
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.640]   18, whatever it is you're getting on the 0% intro on it.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.520]   So that's fine.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.440]   That's how we do it.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.960]   Like, say, for example, if I'm getting a new air conditioner,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.400]   it's $10,000.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.520]   If they're going to charge me a fee to use a credit card,
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.400]   then we just pay cash.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.000]   But if I can do it with a 0% and get the reward,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.840]   and then just pay it right off, then we will just do it that
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.340]   way.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.460]   Now, do you need a new AC?
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.800]   Because if you do, get a heat pump instead of AC.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.440]   Oh, I've got to start back to listening to you.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.920]   Much more economical, and you can get big federal tax credits
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.440]   right now.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.000]   I got it.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.440]   I'll be back to listening to you.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:37.940]   Thank you.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:42.720]   Hello, Clark.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.360]   Hi.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.280]   Where are you from?
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.040]   I'm Rob from Colorado Springs.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.360]   And I didn't--
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.320]   Y'all know each other?
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.920]   This guy's from Colorado Springs, too.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.560]   We actually met once a few years back.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.240]   So I didn't save the easy question for you.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.600]   I got a hard one.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.600]   I'd like to talk about health insurance.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.760]   For those who are retiring before Medicare eligibility,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.280]   you know your choices are COBRA, maybe.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.920]   Don't do COBRA right now.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.560]   OK.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.760]   OK, that's a good piece of advice.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.480]   And the Affordable Health Care Act, ACA,
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.360]   which often leads to very narrow networks,
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   no out-of-state coverage for those of us who like to travel.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.560]   This seems like a tough nut to crack.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.200]   Yeah, so what I've recommended for people
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.640]   who are 50-plus, up to 64, is that you
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.680]   do an HSA-eligible, high-deductible plan
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.720]   on healthcare.gov.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.160]   Because if you do the HSA-eligible,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.760]   high-deductible plan, usually you're
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.560]   not going to be restricted on network
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.640]   like you are in a traditional plan
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.080]   that you would buy on healthcare.gov.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.400]   The networks in a lot of places--
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.600]   here in Colorado Springs, your network's
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.680]   going to be much more narrow than it
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.560]   would be for somebody in Denver or somebody in Phoenix.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.940]   So it's tough for you.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.960]   And that's why I would look through the choices
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.080]   and see if you can find an HSA-eligible,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.320]   high-deductible that allows you the freedom
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   to go where you want.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.480]   OK, thank you.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.440]   And by the way, for the HSA money,
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.760]   don't put it in some terrible HSA savings account.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.800]   You can invest that money.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.840]   And I don't know if there are lightning bolts in here.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.560]   Fidelity is doing the best job I know of on investments
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.040]   for HSA money.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   Well--
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.680]   What's that?
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.960]   That's right.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.480]   You get a tax deduction up front, it grows tax-free,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.520]   and you spend it tax-free.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.680]   The company I work for already chose Fidelity for our HSA.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.360]   Thank you.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.560]   Sure.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.680]   Am I in a lot of trouble?
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.080]   I mentioned Chuck, I mentioned Fidelity.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.200]   No, let me give you some trouble.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.840]   Oh, sure.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.160]   I'm the site administrator.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.760]   I'm Lady Geek from the Philadelphia area.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.840]   As soon as you said avoid COBRA, that hit an alarm bell with me.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.160]   I was-- last year, a year before,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.200]   I was in the same situation.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.720]   I retired, but I was not eligible.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.520]   I didn't want to go on ACA for a while, so I went on COBRA.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.920]   Why did-- why would I go on COBRA?
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.480]   It was cheaper, actually, because I
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.440]   work with an insurance-- a medical insurance broker.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.160]   They are fantastic.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.520]   Not a life insurance, a medical insurance broker.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.680]   They're all over the place.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.360]   It's a guy I've been dealing with for years.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.160]   What he made me aware of is that you're--
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.680]   of course, COBRA, you pay your share plus the employer's share
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.920]   plus 2% administrative fee for 18 months.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.160]   What he told me was that the policy premiums paid
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.440]   by the employer are based on the average age of the workforce.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.560]   So your workforce average age is like 30s.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.280]   So I am like 60-something.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.920]   OK, I'm going to get 65 next-- oh, my god.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.520]   So I actually checked.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.720]   He gave me the rate sheets for the Philadelphia area insurance.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.120]   And I compared the rate sheets for someone
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.640]   60 in the ACA marketplace versus the COBRA cost.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.320]   It was a little more than half to be on COBRA.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.920]   It was a huge, huge savings.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.720]   So I went on COBRA.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.800]   I'm so interested in hearing that because I've not
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.240]   heard that before, so I appreciate the correction
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.000]   from you.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.240]   Yeah, so be careful.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.120]   So first of all, yeah, because, I mean, you're dealing here.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.920]   You want to give general advice, of course.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.840]   But the advantage of having an insurance agent for something--
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.480]   I mean, it doesn't hurt to do yourself.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.800]   But to have someone with that level of experience--
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.840]   I mean, I called him up and said--
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.560]   and it was like an instant answer.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.840]   I said, why?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.640]   So he sent me the rate sheets for his insurance.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   And he was right.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.960]   So be careful.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.680]   Just be aware that the workforce premiums are based not
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.920]   on your individual age.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.960]   Because remember, everybody pays the same premium.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.520]   So they base it on the average age.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.880]   So your premium increases with your age.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.280]   So if you're in the 60s, the ACA marketplace price
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.240]   will be a lot more than if you were in the 30s.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.640]   So you want to use this price, the lower price range.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.480]   Thank you for that.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.120]   OK.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.520]   Clark, thank you for what you do.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.520]   I'm very upset.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.400]   I'm very upset about the Phillies
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.280]   beating my Braves three games to one, two years in a row.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.040]   Typical Philadelphia fan giving it to me.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:54.320]   OK.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.400]   Thanks, Clark.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.960]   I do listen to your podcast.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.600]   And I think you do something for us instead of something to us.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.520]   And so I kind of like the consumer advocate.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.440]   Richard Boyd from Lexington, South Carolina.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   I've run a business for 40 years.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.040]   And like many people, have the sky pennies,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.200]   but have collected a lot of air miles over the years
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.480]   that I really was saving for personal
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.320]   when it wasn't business to use.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.480]   And you read the points guy, you read these folks
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.040]   about how you can take advantage of the best air miles award
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.880]   points.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.440]   And so about a year ago, Forbes ran an article
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   on the top 10 points concierge people that'll do it for you.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.080]   For like $200, they'll search out the best flights
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.720]   to Amsterdam or to London.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.080]   If you're not finding the cheapest fare that's on sale,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.040]   which works, and I appreciate that.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.560]   And I used it and it was fantastic.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.960]   I didn't know if you'd had any interest in that.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.920]   What they ended up telling me was,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.160]   are you willing to reposition?
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.080]   Because Charlotte is not a very friendly airport
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.840]   to use air miles.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.520]   And it'll cost you twice as much.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.000]   But I can get you business class to Amsterdam for 52,000 miles
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.360]   versus out of Charlotte for 100,000 miles.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.240]   And so those points concierge, I don't
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.120]   have the bandwidth, the search.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.000]   Although I think they've got a word hacker now
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.320]   that you can do it on your own.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.880]   But I don't know if you had any input.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.200]   I'm glad you mentioned that, because I
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.840]   meant to mention that earlier and I forgot,
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.200]   that there was a new extensive study that
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   found that international airfares to Europe
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.960]   are much, much, much cheaper out of New York
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.680]   on average versus anywhere else.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.080]   The second cheapest city to fly out of is Boston.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.440]   But I can't fly out of Boston because the Patriots
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.000]   beat my Falcons in the Super Bowl.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.960]   But it is true that the departure point matters so
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.460]   much.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.800]   And we do this a lot, where we go to the gateway.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.400]   We're going to Australia in January.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.600]   And the fare out of LAX was so much cheaper
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.320]   than going from back east that I bought tickets on Southwest
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.040]   to the West Coast.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.340]   And then we're getting on Delta at LA.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:08.760]   And the savings for five of us were just unbelievably
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:09.800]   different.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.280]   So yeah, the departure point gateway for international
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.840]   is everything, whether you're using points or using dollars.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.920]   The point.me was the one website.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.560]   It was highly recommended in terms
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.080]   of if you wanted to book with your air miles
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.240]   and didn't want to have to--
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.120]   Point.me.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:27.880]   I'll check it out.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.040]   I've not looked at that one.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.220]   Hi, Gauri from New York City.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.940]   Thanks for your work and sharing your insights.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.140]   So it seems a lot of bogelheads are hardwired to be frugal,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.780]   meaning they didn't have to learn it.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.740]   They weren't taught it.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.540]   It's a personal preference.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.000]   And conversely, a lot of people seem
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.180]   to be indiscriminately spenders in a hardwired way.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.380]   What have you seen to effectively help folks transfer
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.740]   from the latter to the former?
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.420]   So the earlier you can do it, like with my kids,
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:10.340]   I required all three of my kids to get a regular real job
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.260]   when they turned 15.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.460]   And one of them worked retail.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.860]   The other two worked restaurants.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.340]   And my son was also a lifeguard in addition to that.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.220]   And then I offered each of them what
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.980]   we call the mommy-daddy match on a Roth IRA
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.820]   because a kid doesn't have to pay rent,
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.440]   doesn't have to pay mortgage, doesn't
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.060]   have any of the normal expenses.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.860]   They just blow the money.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.180]   So when I told each of my kids--
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.220]   and I recommend this to anybody if you've
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.780]   got kids that are young or grandkids that are young--
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.660]   that you offer them an incentive to save money
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.340]   that they're earning.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:55.740]   And whatever they save-- let's say they make $2,000 at a job.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.280]   And so they're eligible to do $2,000 a Roth that year.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.060]   So they give me $1,000.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.620]   I match it with $1,000.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.700]   They've got $2,000 in the Roth.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.540]   And all three of my kids are totally into it.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.540]   And I remember my oldest daughter
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.540]   was a freshman in college, and one of her--
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.820]   I don't know if it was personal finance or economics
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:16.980]   or whatever.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.980]   And so the professor was asking-- the instructor
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.020]   was asking, so what should someone
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.700]   do to save for the future?
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.980]   And my daughter raised her hand and says, well,
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.100]   they should do a Roth IRA.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.700]   And all the other students are looking at her like,
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.740]   you are one big loser.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.660]   What are you talking about?
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.540]   But the point is, she was a winner, and she learned it,
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.140]   and it was in her head.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.260]   It's got to start young.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.660]   The younger you can start it, the better.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.100]   What I did with my kids when they were single digit
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.740]   was I'd take them with me to the supermarket,
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.260]   and I'd show them the difference between a store
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.460]   brand and a brand name.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.020]   And the kids, they don't care the consequence
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.140]   that the brand name is more money.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.500]   And what I did with my kids was I said,
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.340]   whatever money we save as you try the store brand instead
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.420]   of the brand name, I'm going to give you half the savings.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.540]   And so all three-- because always market, incentives,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.620]   aligned.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.180]   That is it in capitalism.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.620]   And my kids, two of them are adults now.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.940]   When they go shopping, they're always buying store brand.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.140]   And my middle child loves Aldi, so I really love her
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.980]   more than the other two.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.180]   And so it is something that has to be taught young.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.700]   Now, somebody later in life, if they're a spender,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.580]   it has to be School of Hard Knocks.
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.740]   They have to-- people don't change
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.220]   once they have habits in place until they're ready.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.900]   But there's one thing I recommend
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.980]   to people who can't ever seem to save a dollar.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.820]   I try to get them to save $0.01 of every dollar they make.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.180]   And every six months, step it up another cent.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.600]   And in five years, I'll have them at a dime of every dollar
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.060]   that they're saving, because people don't miss it one penny
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.300]   at a time.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.220]   And it's all about building habits and routines.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:17.720]   Great.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.260]   Thank you.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.300]   Sure.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:20.820]   Hi, Clark.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.820]   We've got back-to-back New York City here.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.780]   I'm Jeremy Zucke.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.820]   So for me--
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.060]   Which borough?
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:26.900]   Manhattan.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.700]   Yeah, me, too.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.020]   Oh, only for two years, though.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.420]   I'm more of a Chicago before that.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.180]   But a bit of a personal question in a way,
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.140]   but I think one of the-- what I saw growing up,
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.820]   like one of the reasons that my parents got divorced
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.500]   was that they had a lot of resources,
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.820]   but one of them was a big cheapskate,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.340]   and like a proud cheapskate, and the other one was not,
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.180]   and thought, we've got a lot to spend.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.140]   Why are we going and sitting by the toilet
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.100]   and coach on the airline when we don't have to?
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.040]   So I'm curious how you coach people
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.380]   who are in relationships to try to follow your principles,
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.300]   but also maintain a strong bond between them.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.900]   So I'm not a good marriage therapist,
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.020]   but I will tell you that it really
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:11.580]   is about communication and respect for each other,
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.140]   and you have to find the compromises.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:18.860]   So you have to find the things that work with a couple.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.260]   Where is it that you can reach an accommodation?
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.140]   And so on this, we're going to spend less,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.020]   but on this, we'll do it your way.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.260]   It has to be an ongoing conversation.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.780]   There's not ever one conversation about money.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.460]   It has to be a continuing thing, and I
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.580]   don't know a couple alive that there's not
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.300]   some level of separation in how they feel about money.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.580]   So it's got to be communication in that couple,
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.460]   and it can't be anybody imposing will on the other,
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.500]   because you're going to build up so much distance and resentment
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.460]   in that relationship if somebody is trying to impose
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.900]   their beliefs on the other person.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.620]   Usually the stronger personality will impose,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.460]   but then the person who's not as strong will resent,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.220]   and it builds distance and that separation.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.860]   Thank you.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.020]   Sure.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.780]   Anybody who's a marriage therapist who
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.020]   wants to take a stab at that?
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.700]   OK, hi.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.700]   I'd like to continue the Phillies' braids,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.220]   but I guess one of us cannot.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.740]   But anyway, OK, don't let me--
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.100]   sorry, a true Philly fan.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.220]   But OK, I'm super--
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.420]   Yeah, but we're from the home of the losers.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.660]   Atlanta is loserville.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.620]   We always lose.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.300]   That's because Atlanta is so fun and so interesting that we
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.580]   always have things to do other than pay attention
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.060]   to whatever we're supposed to be doing.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.500]   All right, so let me--
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.940]   you triggered another--
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.780]   Cobra was the first, but the second, as soon
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.460]   as you said private brands, there's
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.660]   something that's really bugging me in grocery--
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.900]   in the supermarkets, food selection.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.700]   That is the private brand labels.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.260]   Buy all these supermarket chains.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.100]   In the Philadelphia area of ShopRite, you have Giant.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.780]   They have been creeping in, and it's all about the shelf space,
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.980]   you know, how they organize, the profit--
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.540]   more profit, the promotional brands they put first,
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.140]   and do a lot of placement.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:25.100]   They, over the past maybe year, these couple of chains,
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.580]   even the higher end chains, they start putting private labels.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.220]   And they said they're cheaper.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:34.180]   And I think-- I really think they're intentionally boosting
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.980]   prices on the name brands, and they want to introduce
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:37.820]   their private labels.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.900]   But what I've noticed is the difference
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.380]   between frugal and cheap.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:47.220]   I look-- when you look at the product quality, turn--
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.700]   no, look at the price, but look at the ingredients,
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.020]   like all the spaghetti sauce.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.060]   They all have high fructose sugar, lower quality corn
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.020]   syrup, cheaper substitutes, lower quality
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.380]   of the product itself.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.140]   So it just bothers me that they're
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.460]   encroaching on the premium market space, the shelf space,
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.380]   to put their best.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.860]   And they are taking-- they're removing the private--
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.700]   the commercial brands, the brand name stuff.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.940]   So I am actively avoiding private label brands simply
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.060]   because of quality.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.180]   And I can taste the difference.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.020]   I just notice it.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.520]   Like, I will pay.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.420]   Like, the spaghetti sauce is the higher-- the real stuff,
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.780]   it doesn't have sugar in it.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.300]   It is much better.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:33.380]   So like, say, the point of being a boga is you're frugal,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:38.780]   but you need to spend on stuff you want, not stuff you need.
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.420]   So if you want-- so I want better quality food.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.980]   So I will buy--
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.620]   I'm avoiding private label brands
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.020]   so I can buy the name brand to get what I like.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:54.900]   So I would say in rebuttal that it is up to the retailer
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:59.780]   to have private label of a quality that people buy it,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.740]   they're happy with it, and they buy it again.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.660]   When you buy a private label that you're happy with,
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.900]   you win, and the retailer wins.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.260]   The supermarket wins.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.220]   Because they're making a higher margin on that,
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.020]   and you're buying at a lower price.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.060]   And so it's not to their incentive
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.740]   to sell you garbage ingredients in a private label.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.540]   Now, you're looking at the labels, you're seeing garbage.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.100]   But that is not what the industry is really
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.540]   trying to do, generally.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.780]   It's just-- but I just see them--
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.300]   each store has their own brand encroaching on that.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.260]   And you're right, but--
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.860]   It depends on the store and how they do it.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.540]   Yeah, of course, it's a balance.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.820]   But I'm just pointing that out, because this
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.660]   is what I'm seeing.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:52.500]   It's a consumer area that I just don't like to see that.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.940]   So do you shop at Whole Paycheck?
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.140]   No, it's not in our area.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.420]   So people who shop at Whole Paycheck,
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.500]   the 365 brand is really good.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.500]   The ingredients are solid, and it
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.620]   takes something that's four times
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.860]   the cost it would be somewhere else to only 2 and 1/2 times
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.220]   the cost of what it would be at another store.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:17.700]   And so the marketplace provides the competition.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.660]   And in supermarkets, I would say it's not
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:23.100]   that you buy the store brand versus the--
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.420]   the brand name versus store brand where you're shopping.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.700]   It means you're shopping at the wrong supermarket.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.020]   If I can find what I want, I'll go to a different store.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.620]   But I just want to bring up that point, that it's bothering me.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.380]   And I understand it's a trade difference.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.340]   But if I can see the quality, and I can taste the quality,
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.540]   I'll go for that better product.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.040]   OK.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.020]   Back to travel.
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.140]   My name is Paul Brown.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.620]   I'm from Northern California.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.140]   My wife and I have a bucket list trip coming up
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.060]   because I have a four-week sabbatical.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   Pretty excited about it.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.340]   And my question is, is there any value
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.820]   to using a travel agent?
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.540]   And again, the travel agent don't typically charge.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.040]   They do.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.780]   They charge an hourly rate now.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.380]   If you use a sophisticated travel agent,
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.380]   you're going to be paying him or her
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.620]   like you'd pay someone for financial advice who's
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.660]   in this room, or you pay a lawyer or an accountant.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.540]   You're going to pay them for their expertise
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.620]   and a rate per hour for being knowledgeable
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.460]   about the destination and making your trip really great.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.460]   Where is it you're planning on to go on this bucket list trip?
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.420]   I'll see you in Australia in January.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.100]   All right.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:39.740]   So--
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.540]   And I've never been.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.260]   So--
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.820]   What do you hope the agent will do for you?
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.060]   Put a package together that gives us
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.300]   the experience that we want.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.060]   So part-- we're going to do Australia, New Zealand, so--
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.900]   Yeah, so you and--
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.340]   And I've never been, so--
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.580]   And you live in the Bay Area?
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.180]   So Bay Area, you'll have no trouble
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:04.700]   finding someone who's got high certification as a leisure
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.860]   agent, what used to be called a CTC, Certified Travel
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:09.900]   Consultant.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.940]   They use a different term for it now,
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.900]   but it's a professional designation.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.860]   You'll be able to find someone and ask them,
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.620]   how many times have you been to Australia?
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.220]   How many people have you sent to Australia?
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.420]   And a good, experienced, knowledgeable agent
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.260]   will ask you a lot of questions about you--
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.500]   what you enjoy doing, what kind of meals you eat out,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.180]   how important this, that, or the other is.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.660]   They'll interview you first to make
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.820]   sure they're putting together the right kind of trip
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.740]   for you.
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.220]   Great.
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.820]   Thank you.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.820]   Now, on the other hand, with my family going,
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.100]   we have nothing planned.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.780]   It's going to land, and we just wing it.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.460]   So it's a different style of travel.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.980]   Have a great time, by the way.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:57.540]   Hi, Clark.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.780]   Thank you for being here tonight.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.500]   My name is Brian.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.540]   I'm from Vienna, Virginia, right across the Potomac River.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.060]   Since we're very close to DC, I'm
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.420]   going to ask you this open question.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.380]   If you were a congressional staffer
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:12.140]   and could champion the consumer policies of your choice,
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.620]   what would you choose and why?
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.340]   Thank you.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.340]   What would-- you mean, what would I fix?
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:16.820]   Yes.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.700]   In terms of consumers?
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.200]   Exactly.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:24.060]   I think, well, right now, there's
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.780]   federal law that gives the airlines pretty much leeway
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.660]   to do whatever they want.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.820]   And I've been on a slow burn about we, as taxpayers,
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.100]   bailing out the airlines after September 11, '01.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.460]   Then we bailed them out again during COVID,
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:45.100]   gave them billions of dollars with no responsibility
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.460]   to pay it back.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.020]   And then they treat consumers so badly.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.780]   I want us to have a law, like they have in Europe,
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.420]   that if they disrupt your plans, they have to pay you.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.500]   If you don't make a connection and you're
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.100]   going to have to spend the night,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.420]   they're required to pay for your hotel.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.700]   If you're delayed so much time, they
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.820]   have to pay you compensation.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:13.660]   And it has made the airlines in Europe much more honest.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.840]   And they run more efficient operations
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.740]   than we do in the United States.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.120]   So that's the-- because I travel so much,
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.700]   you ask me self-interest.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.220]   If I were on transportation committee in the House,
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.900]   that is what I would do.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.100]   I'd have consumer protections with teeth
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.380]   for people who travel.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:38.220]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:38.700]   Thank you.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:41.980]   We just need to convince Airlines of America of that.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.540]   What's that?
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.380]   We just need to convince Airlines of America,
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.300]   the airline lobbyist group, of that.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.700]   They are intensely powerful.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.160]   They are very good at what they do.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.820]   Hi, Clark.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.900]   I'm Frank from Maryland.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:57.340]   And I just wanted you to comment on electronic vehicles.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.900]   I believe there's a big push, obviously, with the makers
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.300]   right now, rolling out the EVs.
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:05.460]   And will hybrids still be around for a while?
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.540]   Hybrids are going to be around in the world.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.420]   And there will be quite a few sold in the United States.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.580]   Because a lot of the US is so extremely rural
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.000]   that an electric-only vehicle is not necessarily
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.580]   going to be practical till we get
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.780]   to a range of maybe 700, 800 miles on electric vehicles.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.980]   We're not close to that yet.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.340]   And Toyota believes-- and they've
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.380]   been just hammered for this by environmentalists.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.780]   But I think Toyota is right.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.460]   There's going to be a big market in the world.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.740]   Because automobiles are a worldwide market.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:39.620]   It's not just us.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.060]   It's not just any particular country.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.780]   They sell worldwide.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.100]   And there are going to be a lot of places in the world
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.980]   that there's not reliable electricity
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.540]   supplies and the rest.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.660]   And so I think there's going to be a continuing role
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:56.860]   for hybrids for at least a generation moving forward.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:00.700]   Now, I've driven an electric vehicle since 2011.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.420]   I first drove a Nissan LEAF.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.980]   Did anybody else do that?
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.280]   What was the range on yours?
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.660]   Mine dropped to 35 miles total range after a while.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.340]   You're really getting 80 miles?
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:16.900]   How about you?
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:17.380]   How many--
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:21.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.180]   Wow.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:29.420]   So I now drive a Tesla that goes 344 miles on a charge.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.540]   So electric vehicles are so much fun to drive.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.900]   Forget the environmental thing.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.020]   I mean, if you want to be environmental, it's fine.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.820]   But they are so much more fun to drive than gas engine
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.860]   vehicles.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.060]   It's nuts how much fun they are to drive.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:48.580]   It's like a whole different thing.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.060]   Especially if you get the Plaid Plus, huh?
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:56.180]   So I'm not getting a Plaid, because I have a teenage son.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.340]   There will be no Plaid in our household.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.300]   If you don't know the Plaid, it's the world's fastest
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.860]   production vehicle at 1.9 seconds, 0 to 60.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.740]   There is one $5 million car called the Rimac or something?
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.580]   Rimac that's faster?
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.100]   Oh, how many of those do you have?
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.700]   Just-- OK.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.060]   Jim Dolley, Sandy, Utah.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.980]   A lot of us are pretty frugal.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.300]   Many of us are wealthy at this point,
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.420]   partly because we've been frugal our whole lives.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.300]   At what point does it make sense to not
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.500]   spend the time and hassle shopping for the deal?
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.100]   Because we don't need the money.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:42.860]   So something--
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.900]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.660]   Something we didn't talk about is
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.020]   I retired the first time I was 31
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.420]   and never intended to work again.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.340]   And I've always been just, at this point,
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.940]   wired so solidly that way that I just
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.100]   can't seem to let go of that.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.260]   But I did make a deal with my wife
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.380]   that I am about to blow all my credibility,
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.580]   so if you're ready.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:19.380]   So I fly every week, pretty much for work, every week.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.780]   And I fly Southwest, so I get the companion pass.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.340]   I've had the companion pass since 2006.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:31.100]   And my wife flies with me free everywhere we go.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.020]   Whenever she goes with me, her fare, it's not really free.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.100]   We have to pay $11.20 round trip.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.700]   But she's free.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.060]   And she hates Southwest.
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:46.620]   So we reached a deal that up to six times a year,
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:52.260]   if we go international, she says, lie flat, baby,
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.660]   and we fly business class.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:00.660]   Because remember that marriage thing earlier?
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:05.500]   Life involves compromise and negotiation.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.940]   And basically, whatever she says, that's right.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.460]   But this was her deal.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.260]   And you know what I've discovered?
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.100]   I really like flying in one of those lie flat beds
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.540]   in the front of the plane.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.620]   I think he's getting the last question.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.980]   You get the last question.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.460]   Oh, thank you.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.420]   My name is Ramesh.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.660]   I'm from Austin, Texas.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.060]   No offense to Dr. Dow--
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.940]   What's your favorite Amy's ice cream flavor?
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.260]   Oh, Amy's.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.180]   See, everything for me is about food and ice cream.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:39.500]   And if you ever go to Austin, you've got to have Amy's ice
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.380]   cream.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.940]   I like the Mexican vanilla.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.340]   Have you ever tried that?
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.340]   Yes, yes.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.660]   But obviously, that's not your favorite flavor.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.780]   So what is your favorite Amy's ice cream flavor?
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.540]   Oh, the one in the Great Hills, that Amy's ice cream,
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.500]   that's the one I like.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.580]   OK.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.620]   My question is about the doctors.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.700]   I mean, they're in Austin area these days.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.060]   There's a lot of advertisements about concierge services.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:11.020]   They offer $400 a year.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.820]   I'm fairly healthy, so I don't have
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.100]   to worry about major expenses.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.260]   But what's your opinion about these concierge services?
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.460]   They offer 24-hour services.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.740]   So I don't know where you're finding concierge doctors
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.420]   for $400.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.300]   I mean, usually, they're about $2,000.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.900]   And it's something that I think is really
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.780]   advisable for somebody who has a chronic medical condition
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:41.940]   or is at an age where more things may go wrong.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.140]   Because with a good concierge doctor,
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.620]   you get same-day or next-day appointment.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.060]   And you get visits that are typically
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.780]   booked at-- they block an hour for your time with the doctor.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.820]   I mean, normally, when you're with the doctor,
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.660]   you're on a conveyor belt. And they
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.180]   walk in, you're already sliding down the conveyor
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.020]   to go out the door.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.100]   And with a concierge doctor, it's
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.940]   a completely different kind of experience.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.900]   So if you're really healthy, there's
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.060]   no reason to spend that money.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:20.140]   But at a certain age or with a certain condition,
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.460]   I think it's really a great idea if you can afford
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.020]   to pay for the concierge doctor.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:31.140]   And doctors are being crushed, particularly primary care
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.100]   doctors are being crushed by the insurance industry.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:39.060]   And they are not in a position anymore
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:43.220]   to provide the care and the time to a patient that they--
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:46.500]   bless you-- that they historically did.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.180]   Bless you again.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.740]   And so for doctors, they're between a rock and a hard
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.220]   place.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.580]   If you're worried about why medicine is going up
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.220]   so much in cost, it is not the doctors,
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.020]   and it's not even the prescription drugs.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.100]   It's all hospitals.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.020]   It's all hospital bills.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:08.820]   And so the doctors are used to making
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.420]   whatever they've been making in their career.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.140]   And they hate having to reduce the quality of service
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.340]   to their patients.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:21.100]   And that's why the concierge movement's been so big.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.540]   And I think for the right person,
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.700]   it's a great thing to do.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:32.100]   But if you're really, really healthy, wouldn't do it.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.060]   Now, he was supposed to have the last question.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.020]   So ask one really fast.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.180]   Well, it's a quick story, if I may,
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.060]   since you mentioned the importance of compromise
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.620]   in marriage.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.220]   Two weeks before our wedding, my wife and I
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.540]   were walking in Riverside Park.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.660]   We saw this elderly couple before us.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.900]   We approached them and said, we're about to get married.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.660]   You seem like you've been together a while.
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.160]   Do you have any guidance to share with the young couple
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.260]   about to get married?
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.700]   She embraced the question.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.260]   She spoke for two minutes, saying,
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.180]   marriage is about compromise, accommodating.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.420]   You must listen to one another.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.220]   Two minutes.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.060]   I said, thank you.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:05.980]   Sound advice.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.180]   I turned to him.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.580]   What would you like to add, sir?
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.620]   He said these five words.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.580]   Always do what she wants.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:19.940]   My wife loves that second one.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.180]   Thank you very much.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.540]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.260]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:38.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
