[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.240]   My name is Joshua, I am your host,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.240]   and today we begin a discussion on how to find a wife.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.340]   Today is part one, the preparation.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.920]   This is a series that I've wanted to do
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.280]   or wanted to start for a long time.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.020]   I don't intend to go day by day,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.780]   nor am I going to neglect some of the other series
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.820]   that I've got running,
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.420]   but I've decided to do this one today
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.160]   because it'll be an important part
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.460]   of my own personal self-growth,
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.340]   or personal growth and improvement.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.440]   And it's a personal New Year's resolution of mine
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.060]   for the new year.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.600]   I'll explain here as part of just a quick introduction,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.240]   and then we'll get to the meat of a discussion
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.440]   of how to find a wife.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   One of the challenges that I have faced
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   in being a broadcaster is in wanting to do things well.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.480]   And unfortunately, wanting to do things well
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.180]   often results in not getting anything done.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.480]   This is not unique to me.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.420]   This is probably common to both you and me,
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.500]   where we know what we'd like to do,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.900]   and because we'd like to do something really, really well,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600]   well, we use that as our standard,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.260]   and because it takes us a long time
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.160]   to do something really well,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.380]   we often pull back in fear and do nothing.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.340]   And this is a personal character trait, a failing,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.020]   a negative trait that has dogged my heels
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.880]   for the last few years with radical personal finance.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   I've worked hard to overcome it.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.060]   I've made good progress, but I'm still not satisfied.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.980]   I still see things happening again and again,
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.700]   where because I can't do something as well
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.020]   as I would like to,
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.940]   I pull back and don't get it done at all.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.820]   And so this series would be an example like that.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.340]   I know of no subject that causes more conflict
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.340]   in the area of finances and money than marriage,
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.500]   marital relations, marriage problems, marriage philosophies,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.100]   whether to enter into marriage or not be married.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.420]   If you were to survey the average person,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.220]   you will find that money fights
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.520]   are often a major component of their marriage,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800]   and their marriage is a major component
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.380]   of their money challenges.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.980]   And so it feels quite neglectful for me
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.500]   not to address the subject and give you some thoughts
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.420]   and some research,
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.360]   but because it's such a difficult subject
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680]   where we all have such strong experiences
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740]   that are emotionally vivid,
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.020]   and because we all have such strong ideas,
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.260]   depending on what personal background we come from,
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.960]   it's the kind of subject that I feel like
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.980]   needs to be dealt with very, very carefully.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.900]   And frankly, this is true of almost any subject.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.180]   One of my personal ambitions
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.700]   in building Radical Personal Finance was to be accurate
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.220]   and somewhat authoritative
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.180]   in the topics that I would discuss.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.720]   I was frustrated with inaccurate information
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.580]   being presented in the popular space of personal finance.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.540]   And so I've always felt this desire
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.580]   to be academically accurate.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.140]   Unfortunately, it's hard to know everything.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.740]   I make lots of mistakes.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.020]   And in an effort to try to avoid making mistakes,
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.620]   I often mire myself in research.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.420]   And in the way my brain works,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.820]   my brain works in terms of claim, counterclaim,
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.900]   rebuttals, et cetera.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.140]   I can think through the logic of most statements
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.700]   and think about all of the rebuttals.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.660]   And I've often had the desire to present things.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.400]   And I often have this desire to do it comprehensively,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.440]   to wit, even the explanation that I'm giving you right now,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.680]   some people could bring into three sentences,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.820]   but I have this desire, this impulse
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.700]   to try to communicate comprehensively what's happening.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.580]   And I'm doing it because I think it will help you
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.100]   to both understand me and to hopefully evade
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.820]   and learn how to overcome your own procrastination as well,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.980]   as I am doing myself.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.700]   Because of this desire to be complete,
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.460]   I often have this drive to create comprehensive information
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.900]   that is absolutely irrefutable.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.100]   I wanna make a case so strongly
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.740]   that my position is irrefutable
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.420]   because I know I'm gonna put this out there
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.700]   and then the internet's gonna judge
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.280]   and I want my content to be irrefutable.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.840]   Well, unfortunately, that's not a good thing.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.580]   Because first, of course, irrefutable content
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.760]   is often extremely lengthy.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   And when you take a, say a 10 minute simple concept
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.560]   that if you just presented it simply,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.900]   it would have broad appeal
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.760]   because it could be consumed in 10 minutes.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.320]   And you expand it to 60 minutes to handle all of the rebuttals
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   and all of the counter arguments, et cetera,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   it has much more limited appeal.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   But more importantly, it's hard to do that.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.480]   It's hard to come up with all of the rebuttals
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   and it takes a lot of time.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   It takes time to develop the outlines.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.160]   It takes time to make sure that your lists are exhaustive.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.680]   And because of the enormity of certain topics,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.520]   I have often found myself just stuck in the mud,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   not getting stuff done because it's simply too big.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.140]   And that must be fixed.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.320]   That is not a good character trait.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.000]   I will change that.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.120]   I'm making it to you now as a public declaration
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.880]   to force myself out of the pride
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.200]   of putting myself in a situation to change it.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.560]   It will change.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   And so my commitment is we begin this new year
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   is to produce more,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.140]   now some people would say produce more bad work,
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.680]   produce more cursory content,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.360]   to just simply let fly
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.100]   with things that are not so comprehensive.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.760]   Because if this is not solved, if I don't change this,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.000]   the entire project of radical personal finance
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.320]   will forever remain a fraction of what it could be
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.040]   if I don't solve that.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.760]   And so you are gonna be hearing in the coming years,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   you're gonna be hearing much more straightforward,
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.000]   turn on the microphone and let it go, work.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.760]   That's not an excuse for mediocrity
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.140]   in terms of my own delivery.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.740]   That's not an excuse for not being prepared.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.420]   None of that, just simply that I'm going to be less focused
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.780]   on being comprehensive
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.420]   so that I can create more helpful content.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.520]   We begin that in today's discussion.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.780]   As I said, I don't know of anything that's more difficult
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.100]   in money than relationships, than marriage.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.300]   And it's hard to find anything
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.040]   that's more difficult in marriage than money.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.240]   And so it seems important to talk about.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.280]   But because there are so many variations,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   so many questions, so many things,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.680]   I've never felt like I had
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.520]   that comprehensive encyclopedic answer,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.680]   which obviously is a foolish thing to expect anyone to have.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   And that's what's held me back.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.480]   But I'm not gonna stop at this point.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.280]   I'm gonna talk about it.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.120]   And in this part of the series,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   I am specifically desiring to speak to young men.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.620]   That is my goal.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.820]   I'm picturing in this series, my son.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.500]   Picturing him in his early to middle teenage years.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500]   And I'm picturing giving him advice about finding a wife.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.940]   So if you are a young listener,
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.660]   this series will help you.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.100]   Because I personally believe
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.580]   that finding a good wife
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.380]   is one of the most important things
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.580]   that a young man can do.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.580]   It's one of the most valuable things
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.660]   that a young man can engage in.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.360]   It's very rare when I find a happily married husband,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.900]   it's very rare to find a man
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.340]   who will put money ahead of his wife.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.180]   I personally am very fortunate
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.780]   that I found an excellent wife.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.540]   I'm married to an excellent woman.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:46.580]   I would quickly, if necessary,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.300]   I would quickly sacrifice
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.980]   any financial amount of money that I needed to,
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.620]   to see to her wellbeing.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.260]   If she were sick,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.220]   we would spend all our money to try to get her well,
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.460]   if that were necessary.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.140]   And I think most men would do that.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.620]   In fact, I think most men do that.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.500]   But there are some caveats though.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.540]   You'll notice, for example,
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.100]   that I've used the word excellent
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.700]   as an adjective describing my wife, an excellent wife.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.460]   Now, of course, those of you who are familiar
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.220]   with the scriptures,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.260]   the Jewish and Christian scriptures in the Old Testament
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.300]   will quickly connote or quickly be reminded
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.820]   of the verse in Proverbs that uses that adjective,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.440]   an excellent wife.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.340]   There's a verse in the book of Proverbs 31
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.700]   that says, "An excellent wife, who can find?
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.420]   She is far more precious than jewels.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.660]   The heart of her husband trusts in her
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.100]   and he will have no lack of gain."
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.140]   So for me personally,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.460]   that statement about the fact that my wife
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.380]   is an extremely valuable asset to me
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.180]   is both an observational fact,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.140]   me just simply observing my life,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.580]   observing the lives of other people
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.340]   and recognizing it to be true.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.940]   And it's also a theological statement of faith.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.660]   The Bible says it and so I affirm it,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.740]   whether or not I fully understand it.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.660]   But there are those modifiers.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.620]   And I wanna focus on that for just a moment
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.060]   as a way of broaching this topic.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.540]   Because if you just wanna go out and get married,
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.180]   you could do that pretty easily.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.180]   You can go out, if you're a dude,
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.860]   you can go out and you can find a girl who'll marry you.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.740]   There are plenty of them out there.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.380]   But it's harder to marry well.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.900]   It's harder to find an excellent wife.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.740]   And there is a lot of pre-work that needs to be done,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.020]   a lot of preparation.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.260]   That particular verse in Proverbs says this,
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.180]   "An excellent wife, who can find?"
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.940]   Question mark.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.420]   An excellent wife, who can find?
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.580]   And I like some of the various translations of this.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.700]   So if you're not familiar with the concept of translations,
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.540]   the original scripture here is written in ancient Hebrew.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.260]   And then modern English translations
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.940]   are translated in different ways by different people
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.740]   and different teams of translators.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.340]   But here are some of the various translations.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.180]   A wife of noble character, who can find?
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.380]   She is worth far more than rubies.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.420]   Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.020]   She is more precious than rubies.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.460]   Who can find a virtuous woman?
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.020]   For her price is far above rubies.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.980]   Contemporary English version, which is a paraphrase,
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.700]   says this, "A truly good wife
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.980]   "is the most precious treasure a man can find."
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.700]   I like the good news translation.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.740]   It says this, "How hard it is to find a capable wife.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.780]   "She is worth far more than jewels."
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.700]   Or another version, "Who can find a worthy woman?"
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.660]   Aramaic Bible in plain English says,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.540]   "Who finds a diligent woman?
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.540]   "For she is precious beyond incomparable precious stones."
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.700]   Another translation, "Who can find a wife
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.060]   "with a strong character?
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.980]   "She is worth far more than jewels."
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.180]   Or, "A woman of valor, who can find?
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.660]   "For her price is far above rubies."
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.140]   Who shall find a virtuous woman?
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.620]   For such a one is more valuable than precious stones.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.220]   Who shall find a valiant woman?
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.340]   Far and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.140]   A woman of worth, who doth find?
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.380]   Yay, far above rubies is her price.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.820]   So you can see in all of these different translations
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.060]   that there is a modifier, an adjective,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.820]   that modifies the word wife or woman.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.720]   And that is a modifier of excellence.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.820]   That is the hard thing, to find an excellent or worthy
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.860]   or noble or virtuous wife.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:12.420]   And it's that kind of wife that is more valuable than money.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.660]   It's that kind of wife that is more valuable than jewels.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.100]   Of course, it should be fairly self-evident
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.460]   that we can substitute money for jewels or rubies.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.980]   These were old-fashioned expressions of money.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.340]   Most, I mean, of course, they still have that reality
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.940]   of being expensive, costly things.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.100]   But the meaning, the poetic meaning is clear.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.520]   An excellent wife is more valuable than money.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   That does not mean that a wife is more valuable than money,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.420]   but an excellent wife is.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.700]   And herein, we find the conflict of the modern age.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.220]   How do we find an excellent wife?
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.440]   What is an excellent wife?
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.740]   How would we define such a woman?
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.460]   How would we know such a woman if we met her?
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.780]   What would be the standards that we would hold up
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.220]   that we would judge her by
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.140]   to see if she was worth more than money?
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.580]   Just any wife, just any woman,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.540]   a non-excellent wife is not more valuable than money.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.440]   A woman without virtue is not more valuable
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   than rubies or jewels.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.640]   In fact, your life will become a living hell.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.520]   In fact, we could take one of my other favorite Proverbs
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.360]   and preach from it.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.900]   From chapter 17 of the book of Proverbs,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.220]   "Better is a dry morsel with quiet
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.660]   "than a house full of feasting with strife."
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.620]   Or, "Better a dry crust eaten in peace
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.820]   "than a house filled with feasting and conflict."
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.060]   So from that, we can see this obvious parallels.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.720]   Either you can find an excellent wife
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.700]   and her presence will be far more valuable than any money.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.680]   She's worth more than rubies, than jewels, than money.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.580]   But if you don't choose carefully,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:13.740]   better a dry crust with peace and quiet,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.140]   better a dry crust with peace and quiet
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.200]   than a house full of feasting with strife.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.160]   Or perhaps we could preach from Proverbs 25.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.000]   Better to live,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.320]   "It's better to live in a corner of the housetop
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.400]   "than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife."
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.680]   On this one, I like the New Living translation.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.260]   "It's better to live alone in the corner of an attic
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.140]   "than with a quarrelsome wife in a lovely home."
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.880]   You go back to the King James.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.020]   "It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.000]   "than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   "Better to live on the corner of a roof
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.480]   "than to share a house with a nagging wife."
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.840]   Anyway, you get the point.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.160]   So we have this incredible parallel here.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.320]   We have this parallel of things being really valuable,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.720]   of a good wife being really valuable,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.480]   but a bad wife being one of the worst curses
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.680]   you can ever go through.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.360]   Now, here's what I find very interesting,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.200]   back to the original Bible verse
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.900]   that I started this series on, from Proverbs 31.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.400]   "An excellent wife, who can find?
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.200]   "She is far more precious than jewels.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.780]   "The heart of her husband trusts in her,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.620]   "and he will have no lack of gain."
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:38.340]   Again, the heart of her husband trusts in her,
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.340]   and he will have no lack of gain.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.340]   Let me give you a couple of variations on this one.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.880]   The New Living, "Her husband can trust her,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.700]   "and she will greatly enrich his life."
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.140]   Or, "The heart of her husband trusts in her,
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.360]   "and he will not lack anything good."
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.240]   Or, "Her husband depends on her,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.220]   "and she never lets him down."
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.780]   Good News Translation,
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.380]   "Her husband puts his confidence in her,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.180]   "and he will never be poor."
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:25.760]   Interesting, huh?
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.020]   See the parallel here?
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.660]   The parallel between wealth, a woman,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.700]   a virtuous and excellent wife,
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.820]   being more valuable than money,
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.180]   and yet that woman, because she is trustworthy
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.140]   and worthy of her husband's confidence,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.820]   his ensuing prosperity.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.260]   An excellent woman leads to prosperity.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.300]   On the other hand, better to be poor
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.580]   than with a nagging or quarrelsome wife.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.620]   Better to live on the corner of a rooftop
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.200]   than with a nagging or quarrelsome wife.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.920]   Now, these are all Bible verses.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.100]   What I find interesting is to look at modern life
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.380]   and to see, can you see evidence born out in real life
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.480]   or in your own experience of these things?
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.660]   My observation, my experience,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.180]   I have an intense interest in the subject,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.300]   I talk, I ask a lot of people when I have the chance
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.140]   about their own personal experiences.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.740]   My own experience has born out this truth
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.640]   that I'm trying to draw,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.580]   this dividing line between these two things.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.580]   I'm thrilled to have been blessed with an excellent wife.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.540]   And because my wife is excellent,
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.580]   I enjoy a lot of gain.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.780]   I enjoy a lot of growth.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.640]   I enjoy a lot of riches, both monetary and otherwise.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.540]   But man, I have sure known and seen some quarrelsome women
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.220]   and I would walk away in an instant
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.340]   and never want to be with them.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.500]   So when we talk about marriage,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   you better take this very, very carefully and seriously
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.060]   because if you choose well,
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.060]   there are a lot of blessings that come with it.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.800]   If you don't choose well,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.260]   there are a lot of curses that come with it
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.220]   and these curses are financial.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.460]   Perhaps the most obvious expression of this
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.880]   would be if you look and study the lives of wealthy men,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.460]   it would be very rare to find a wealthy man
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.300]   who did not have an excellent wife
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.060]   keeping his house together
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:50.340]   because it's not possible to simultaneously be
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.380]   the world's greatest businessman
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.900]   and the world's greatest father
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.380]   and the world's greatest husband
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.780]   and the world's greatest investor
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.180]   if you don't have help.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.060]   You can't do it.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.140]   Now, I'm sure that there are many, of course, who try,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.540]   who are forced into the position of being a single father
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.380]   and they dedicate themselves to it as best as they can,
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.860]   but it's tough, it's hard.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.900]   And so there are just some practical realities
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.760]   that are important to recognize.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.720]   Now, I wanna give you some thoughts about preparation
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.700]   because the first thing I'm convinced
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.940]   that you have to do in order to find and attract
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.940]   an excellent wife is to be an excellent man,
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.940]   to be an excellent husband
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.700]   because an excellent wife
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.420]   will be very discerning in her tastes.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.940]   She'll be very careful in the decisions that she makes.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.340]   And so you've got to be the kind of man
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.900]   that an excellent wife will be attracted to.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:10.300]   And it would be best if you would become that kind of man
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.980]   at a very early age
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.940]   because you will have a much higher probability
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.620]   of being able to find and attract
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.220]   and marry an excellent wife
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.140]   if you will be an excellent man at an early age.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.380]   There are massive, massive benefits
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.380]   that come from marrying young, if you marry well.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.500]   My wife and I married when we were both 26,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.820]   which is about the average median age
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.220]   at which most people marry.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.340]   We were right in line with the statistical norms.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.220]   I wish I had married younger.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.180]   I think she wishes that too.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.580]   I should ask her before putting those words in her mouth,
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.540]   but I wish I had married younger.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.460]   Now, there is some statistical sociological data
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.620]   that indicates that marriages are shorter lived
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.020]   among younger people who marry
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.260]   than among people who marry
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.180]   when they are reaching a different stage of maturity,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.340]   mid-20s, is where that statistical analysis changes.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.460]   You should be aware of that.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.180]   I'm personally not distrustful of that data,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.700]   but I'm distrustful of the causes involved in it.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.500]   I don't wanna delve too deeply into that.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.420]   You should be aware of that data,
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.300]   but I don't see any reason why my wife and I
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   would not have been able to build a successful of a marriage
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.640]   if we had married younger.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.120]   And I've taken a poll of many of my friends,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.780]   and most of them, at least the ones,
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.500]   this is just a very casual poll, casual sampling,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.840]   just in personal communication,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.660]   but most of us who are married well,
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.860]   most men I know who are married well make two comments.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.740]   Number one, they are very happy to be married.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.980]   They're very happy to be married.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.060]   If they married well.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.020]   And most of the people that I hang out with
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.700]   have married well.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.140]   And they're very happy to be married.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.820]   Very rarely, we joke about this sometimes,
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.220]   me with some of my other married friends,
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.100]   and we say, "Would you ever wanna go back to being single?"
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.060]   And the answer is no, not a bit.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.940]   Nobody sits back and says,
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.580]   "Man, I wish I could go back to college
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.100]   "and get some more girls."
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.300]   None of us say that.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.900]   All of us are thrilled and happy with married life
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.220]   if we're married well.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   The second thing has been an appreciation of marrying young.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.340]   Again, lots of benefits.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.940]   I'll briefly mention more on that
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.700]   towards the end of this show in later in my outline.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.860]   So I wanna talk about preparation.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.700]   I'm gonna keep this simple
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.620]   and give you some specific suggestions
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.820]   for you as a younger man
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.500]   of how to prepare yourself to be the kind of man
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.380]   that would be attractive to an excellent wife.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.700]   Number one, be a man.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.620]   Grow up and be a man.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.660]   I'm not perfect on my language.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.280]   I slip sometimes.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.620]   But I work very diligently to never refer
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.020]   to people who are past the age of adolescence
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.020]   or who are in the age of adolescence or past it as kids.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.580]   I slip up sometimes.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.620]   I concede that.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.620]   It's hard.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.460]   In a society where we call 20-year-olds kids,
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.900]   it's hard to not slip up.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.420]   But I try very hard to never refer to people
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.180]   who are past, say, double digits, 10, 11, 12, 13,
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.040]   as anything other than young men and young women.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.960]   And I do that intentionally
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.320]   because we live in a culture
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.120]   that praises the infantilization of men and women
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   and wants to keep boys as boys until you're 35 years old,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.200]   which is ridiculous.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.800]   Grow up and be a man.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   And that will happen as soon as you decide it will.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.080]   You can either choose to continue to be an infant, a kid,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.380]   into your 30s at this point or even longer,
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.140]   and society will pretty much bear with you,
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.140]   or you can choose to be a man.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.620]   I recommend that you choose to grow up and be a man.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.460]   What does that mean?
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.940]   Well, there are many things,
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.940]   but specifically, embrace the concept of adulthood.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.740]   Set a clear course for your life.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.460]   Set goals for yourself and pursue them.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.940]   Develop ambition.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.040]   Develop a plan.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.960]   And if you'll do that, if you'll set out goals,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.840]   if you'll develop ambition and make a plan,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.060]   that process of personal growth
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.280]   that you will need to go through
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.120]   in order to achieve your goals
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.540]   will, in time, bring you into a position of manhood.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.320]   I don't know of any bright line indicator
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.280]   that could be used to establish
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.480]   if somebody is a boy or a man.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   I have no use for chronological indicators,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.400]   except as a general understanding.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   For example, I would not call a five-year-old boy a man,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.660]   or would I necessarily call a 30-year-old a man,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.280]   although I'd be much more inclined
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   to call the 30-year-old a man than a five-year-old.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.860]   Has much more to do with indicators of behavior.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.720]   Now, not the absurd and stupid indicators
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.540]   of behavior either.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.460]   You're not a man if you get drunk.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.160]   You're not a man if you've lost your virginity.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.260]   You're not a man if you've learned
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.180]   how to swear like a sailor.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.940]   There are other aspects of masculinity
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.880]   and manhood that are important.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.060]   But to keep things simple today,
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.740]   set out a clear course for your life
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.600]   and embrace the advances of life.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.740]   It's not attractive to try to retain
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.940]   your status as an infant or as a boy.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.380]   There is nothing attractive about a 20-year-old
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.220]   choosing not to grow up.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.420]   Embrace the responsibility of life.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.740]   Lean your shoulder into it and work hard at it,
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.900]   and you'll start to enjoy the benefits
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.180]   that come with manhood.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.180]   Now, here's what's interesting
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.340]   in the vein of attracting a woman.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   If you will be a man, if you'll act like a man,
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.680]   if you'll study masculinity,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.580]   what does it mean to be a man and become one
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.060]   or start the process of becoming one?
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.960]   If you'll set a clear course for your own life,
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.540]   your own personal goals,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.760]   you'll have plenty of marriage prospects
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.460]   available to you if you want them.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.700]   Now, you may not want them.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.460]   You might choose to never marry.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.020]   There are many men who make that choice,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.400]   and I don't think it's a foolish choice.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.280]   It is better for you to never marry
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.960]   than to marry a non-excellent woman.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.120]   It is much better for you to stay single
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.620]   than to marry a nagging woman.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:32.820]   So it's better to never marry than to marry poorly,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.820]   but I am convinced it's better to marry well
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.480]   than to not marry at all
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.880]   if you can find an excellent wife.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   The great thing is if you will set out goals for your life,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.640]   if you'll set out a course, if you'll develop ambition,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.880]   that will suit you if you never marry.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.800]   That will help you to enjoy a life of singleness
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.960]   as a single man,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:03.720]   but it will also be extremely attractive to excellent women,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.500]   and you will have plenty of marriage prospects.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.420]   Now, I can quit with that.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.940]   If you'll take just the simple,
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.420]   undefined language that I used of be a man,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.460]   grow up and be a man,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.220]   and you'll develop what that means to you, that's enough,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.180]   but I wanna give you another, a few more points.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.260]   If you would like to develop,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.620]   I'm sorry, if you would like to attract to you
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.140]   an excellent wife,
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.740]   it will help you to be rich.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.500]   It will also help you at least
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.420]   to be on your way to being rich.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.820]   Wealth is extremely attractive to women.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:48.900]   Wealth is extremely attractive to women.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.460]   You don't need me to cite any data here.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.980]   Just consider your own experience and look around.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:00.980]   Wealth is extremely attractive to women.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.180]   Now, here's what's neat about that.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.780]   Wealth can be developed.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.620]   It can be achieved.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.220]   It can be accomplished.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.260]   That's what I talk about here all day, every day,
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.500]   and as part of becoming a man,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   you should naturally become wealthy.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.740]   Part of being a man is being independent,
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.180]   providing for yourself.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.340]   Well, what do you need to be independent
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   and providing for yourself?
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.700]   You need a source of income.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.620]   You need a livelihood.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.460]   You need a job.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.380]   You need a business,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.380]   and so if you get a job, you'll have income.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.820]   If you start a business, you'll have income.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.500]   Then part of being a man involves being prudent,
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.340]   being frugal, saving money.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.820]   Well, what happens if you have a job and you save money,
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.300]   you start to actually be wealthy?
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.340]   The great thing about this is it can be done
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.740]   in an age-appropriate way.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.100]   No one expects a 15-year-old young man
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.300]   to have as much wealth as a 45-year-old man ought to have.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.500]   So you can begin the process of becoming wealthy,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.300]   and wealth is extremely attractive to women.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   Here's also what's cool,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.100]   especially if you're starting young.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:11.220]   You don't actually have to currently be rich
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.300]   or be wealthy to be attractive,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.900]   but if you are ambitious or if you have the character
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.940]   and the clarity of plan that you know you will be rich,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.500]   that's attractive.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.060]   See, when you're younger,
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.180]   a younger woman has different standards
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.380]   than an older woman does, and she should.
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.300]   It would be absurd for a 20-year-old woman
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.660]   to state as one of her criteria
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.420]   that she's only willing to marry a man who is a millionaire.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.700]   It would be a very vanishingly rare 20-year-old
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.740]   who was a millionaire of their own hand.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.580]   So that would be absurd.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.580]   But you can be a 20-year-old
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.980]   who's on your way to being a millionaire,
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.180]   and an excellent woman, an excellent wife,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.900]   will be able to identify the character traits,
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.340]   and she'll be attracted to those character traits.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.340]   So if you're not rich, start with being ambitious.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.660]   Be ambitious.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.060]   Set goals.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.860]   Have ambition.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.740]   And a young woman, if you are young,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.540]   a young woman who is serious and interested in marriage,
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.860]   she will identify those character traits,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.380]   and they'll be attractive to her.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.060]   I do believe at this point
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.460]   that a cautionary statement is warranted.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.020]   I think it's wise to be careful
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.900]   in how you display the symbols of wealth
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.900]   so that you send the right signals to the right women.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.220]   Here, I think it's a major danger
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   to focus just on flashy, ostentatious displays of wealth,
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.180]   because if you do that,
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.740]   you run the risk of attracting a woman
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.020]   who is interested in flashy, ostentatious displays of wealth.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.540]   Unfortunately, especially at a young age,
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.700]   flashy, ostentatious displays of wealth
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.860]   don't actually lead to becoming wealthy.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.420]   Simple example would be an automobile.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.540]   Of course, this is changing in a modern culture,
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.580]   but traditionally in US American culture,
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.780]   the car that you drive says a lot about you.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.420]   But if you're 20 years old
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.620]   and you're driving a brand new, fancy leased car,
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.220]   and unless you have a massive income
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.500]   that you've already developed behind it,
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.540]   that's a good sign that you're not destined to be wealthy.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.060]   And the kind of woman who would be attractive
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.460]   to that kind of status indicator
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.220]   is also probably the kind of woman
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.780]   who will consume a whole lot of your income
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.420]   and keep you from being wealthy.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.420]   And so since in order for you to actually become wealthy,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.580]   frugality will be required,
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.220]   it would be good to be able to demonstrate that frugality
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.340]   and to choose a woman who is also frugal.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:08.980]   It is almost impossible, virtually impossible
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.660]   for you to out-earn a spendthrift wife.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.820]   And so you better be careful
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.660]   that you don't attract one.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.820]   So think carefully here,
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.060]   it's a good idea not to be too flashy.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:26.500]   So be rich or be on your way to being rich
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.580]   because wealth is extremely attractive to women.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   Focus on it, set out a course and work your plan.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.300]   If that means that you need a job, get a job.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.100]   If that means that you need an academic credential,
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.580]   go get a college degree.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.780]   If that means you need to start a business, get after it.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.820]   Get busy and build wealth.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.460]   And if you will do that,
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.100]   you will find your pool of prospects to be very broad.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.100]   Next, be physically attractive.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.700]   You must be physically attractive.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.820]   Don't be sloppy, don't be weak,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.980]   don't be small, don't be puny.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.380]   Now there are some things you can control
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.260]   and some things you can't.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.780]   You can't control the size of your nose
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.020]   or the jut of your chin,
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.100]   but you can control if you're sloppily obese,
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   you can control if you're weak and a wimp.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.100]   So get busy and start becoming physically attractive.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.100]   Men who are physically attractive
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.960]   are extremely attractive to women.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.100]   So become physically attractive.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.500]   Control the things that you can control.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.220]   And at the very least, don't be sloppy.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.980]   Now here's what's neat.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.260]   If you will work on becoming strong, fit,
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.740]   that will be helpful to you in your quest for wealth.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.060]   Your physical health will make a big difference
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.540]   in your ability over time to earn an income.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.820]   Your physical health and energy and vitality and stamina
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.460]   will be a large determinant of how hard you can work,
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.020]   how long you can work,
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.580]   the type of energy that you can bring
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.380]   to your work interactions.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.100]   And so your health will impact your wealth.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.620]   And then in reverse, it's also true.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.380]   The more money you have,
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.300]   the more money you can spend on improving your health.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.060]   And if you look at the expenditures of wealthy people,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.020]   they usually will accumulate some status symbols over time,
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.580]   but then quickly they realize
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.380]   that investments in their own physical health
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.220]   are some of the most productive investments.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.580]   And so these two things are inextricably linked.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.240]   You have to have and work on both of them.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.580]   So become physically attractive, become strong.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:48.260]   If you'll do that, they'll play off of one another.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.700]   And so you can identify two of the most important,
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.780]   most attractive things to women,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.960]   and they work off of each other.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.760]   I remind you, here's the cool thing.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.260]   They're great for you personally,
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.180]   regardless of whether you ever marry or not.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.600]   And so there's no downside to becoming wealthy.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.000]   There's no downside to becoming strong and vibrant
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.100]   and healthy and physically attractive.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.080]   There's no downside.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:22.200]   Next, be a man of integrity and character.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.780]   Be a man of integrity and character.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.320]   Be a virtuous man.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.760]   Because an excellent wife is one
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.200]   who will be attracted to your character and moral virtue
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.460]   in addition to your wealth and your physical attractiveness.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:48.680]   If you are wealthy and/or physically attractive,
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.260]   you can have as many women as you want.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:59.480]   But if you only have wealth and/or physical attractiveness,
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:04.180]   it will be very hard for you to attract an excellent wife.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.520]   Because an excellent wife will also care
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.740]   about integrity and character.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.300]   Doubt me, put it in reverse.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.760]   If you are a promiscuous man
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.680]   and you find a woman who is rich,
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.940]   and/or you find a woman who is attractive,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.960]   you will have a large temptation
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.760]   to indulge in a sexual relationship with that woman.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.520]   But it's very unlikely that you would wish
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.000]   to marry her exclusively based upon her wealth
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.600]   and/or her physical beauty.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.320]   But if she is also a woman of integrity and character,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.280]   and if you could put one factor of integrity and character
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.300]   together with either wealth and/or physical attractiveness,
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.220]   now you have a much brighter prospect.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.260]   So be a man of integrity and character
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.140]   because the kind of woman that you would want to marry
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.980]   will be attracted to your character and to your moral virtue.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:17.620]   Why does this matter so much?
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.900]   Well, first, you have to attract an excellent wife,
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.340]   but it also matters because in order for you
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.500]   to respect yourself, you will need to be able
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.700]   to respect your integrity and your character.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.500]   If you put these things together,
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   you will be a man who is brimming with confidence,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.820]   personal self-confidence.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.860]   Now, perhaps there's some possibility
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.000]   that you can develop personal self-confidence
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.020]   with some form of trickery.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.140]   I don't personally buy it, though,
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.860]   and I think it's a very inefficient process.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.740]   The best way to become self-confident
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.300]   is just to simply do things that would cause you
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.500]   to become self-confident,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.320]   such as set goals and achieve them.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.660]   Do hard things well.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.120]   Do things with character.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.780]   Stand up for what's right in the midst of somebody
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.480]   that tells you to do what's wrong.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.580]   Do hard things to be frugal.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.900]   Develop self-confidence.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.580]   When you have money, you'll be more confident.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.940]   When you invest well,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.820]   you'll gain confidence in your skills.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.620]   If you're physically attractive, you work hard,
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.220]   you push yourself physically,
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.400]   you'll be and develop more self-confidence.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.820]   If you can respect yourself
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.060]   because of your integrity and your character,
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.160]   you'll be self-confidence.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.860]   Now, what is incredibly appealing to women
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.580]   on a physical level, on a sexual level?
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.660]   Self-confidence.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:53.180]   So you can develop confidence and self-confidence
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.040]   with all of these things together.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.020]   Now, at this point in time,
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.800]   if you have done these things, you've developed wealth.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.140]   If you've laid out an ambitious project
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.760]   of goal setting for yourself
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.180]   and you're on the path to becoming wealthy,
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.620]   if you're not there yet,
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.860]   if you're physically attractive,
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.780]   you've developed your own personal strength,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.420]   you've developed your own personal style,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.120]   you've developed your own physical attractiveness,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.140]   you're a person of a contagority, a man of character,
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.920]   and all of these things come together
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.520]   to make you confident you now have a choice to make.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:35.620]   To what end will you use your attractiveness to women?
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.640]   Because at this point,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.920]   you will be attractive to many, many women.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.680]   And you can either choose to pursue a wife
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:51.160]   or you can choose to pursue sexual indulgement
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.880]   without a wife.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.440]   And there are two different paths here.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.480]   Because an excellent wife that you would want to marry
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.260]   will be one who also would want you
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.180]   to maintain your own sexual purity.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.180]   The kind of woman you would actually want to marry
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.380]   is one who has maintained her own sexual purity.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.120]   Now, why would you expect her to do that
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.640]   if you don't expect yourself to do that?
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.760]   So you need to make a commitment
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.460]   to maintain your sexual purity until marriage.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.600]   That's a hard decision.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.300]   And that decision will only come out of your own personal,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:45.320]   clear understanding of right and wrong,
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.200]   of your worldview,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.360]   and of your own personal decision of the impact.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.960]   You don't necessarily have to adopt my own worldview
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.560]   or my own convictions on the subject.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   To be clear, I believe that all sexual contact,
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.040]   contact of any kind should be reserved
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   for a one-man, one-woman marriage relationship for life.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.480]   That's simple.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.560]   You don't necessarily have to adopt that
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.760]   to see the wisdom of it.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.960]   Meaning that I believe any sexual contact
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.920]   outside of a one-man, one-woman relationship,
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.600]   a marriage relationship for life is sin.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.160]   It's a violation of God's law
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.880]   and it will be judged as sin by God.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.400]   But you can see the wisdom of that
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.060]   even if you don't personally embrace my own understanding
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.740]   of the source of that wisdom.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.060]   Again, the kind of woman
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.160]   that you would actually want to marry
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.880]   is one who's maintained her own sexual purity.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.080]   So if she's played the harlot for many years
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.120]   and then decided to settle down, which is very common
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.400]   among the way, in the way that women's sexual cycles work
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.640]   over the course of their lifetime,
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   especially in our modern era,
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.340]   why would you be attracted to her?
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.480]   It's very common, especially in the hyper-sexualized culture
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.000]   of the United States of America,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.520]   that women will spend years behaving like a whore
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.800]   and then finally decide,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.360]   "Okay, I want to find the good man and settle down."
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.360]   Now at that point in time, why would you want her?
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.820]   If you study marriage, you find that sexual promiscuity
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.900]   causes deep, deep problems for marriage.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.960]   Many of the significant interpersonal conflicts
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.360]   that men and women face in their marriage relationships,
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.740]   the things that drive them apart,
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.480]   the things that have them screaming at each other
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.920]   through the house, come from the sexual behavior
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.680]   that they've engaged in throughout their lifetime.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.560]   Some of those scars are outside of the responsibility
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.200]   of the people involved.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   Somebody's endured abuse when they were a child.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.880]   That was outside of the area of responsibility
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.340]   for the person.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.760]   But some of those are fully within the responsibility
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.100]   of the individual person.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.140]   Now obviously for a woman,
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.540]   some of the most difficult issues involve children.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.780]   If you're interested in a woman who has bastard children,
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.480]   you'll have a very difficult time
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.500]   in your marriage relationship integrating with them.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.760]   It's not impossible, but it's certainly difficult.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.840]   You look at blended families and the challenges
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.480]   of those marriage relationships,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.560]   and it's a lot easier if a woman that you're pursuing
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.480]   was never married, but still it's really, really tough.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.200]   Not impossible, but difficult.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.360]   And of course, that's preferable to the alternative,
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.200]   but it's super tough.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000]   Now the alternative, if she's aborted her children,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.680]   you'll have a very difficult time trusting her.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.360]   It says a lot about a woman's character
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.780]   when she'll murder her own babies
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.060]   in order to further her own life
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.240]   and her own personal ambition and freedom.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.080]   Is that the kind of mother you want for your children?
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.520]   Thank God that repentance and forgiveness is possible,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   but if you're involved with a woman like that,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.800]   you better see some strong fruit of repentance.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.580]   Now, even if no children have ever entered the picture,
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.840]   you'll have strong problems
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.240]   if she's been a promiscuous woman.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.680]   She'll have a hard time attaching to you emotionally.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.480]   There will be a long history of others
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.560]   that you're compared to, both good things and bad things,
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.780]   both sexually and relationally.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.040]   So your very best possible outcome
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.520]   is for you to search for a woman
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.160]   who does not have a history
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.040]   of sexual and relational promiscuity.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.440]   Now, how do you find that in the modern world?
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.100]   Well, chances are that you'll have a better chance
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.380]   of that happening if she is young,
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.680]   which means that you also should be young.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.080]   It's very hard to make
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.840]   cross-generational marriage relationships work.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.220]   So your best chance of finding and attracting a young woman,
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.480]   who also is a woman of purity and virtue,
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.880]   will come when you're young.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.100]   And then, of course, she should have a clear intention
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.240]   about maintaining her personal virtue,
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.840]   which means that you would only qualify
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.280]   to come past her radar screen
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.980]   if you've maintained your own personal sexual virtue.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:05.780]   Now, there are many more things that we could say.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.540]   My point is, you will have to make a choice.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:13.520]   And I recommend to you that you make a choice
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.480]   to not choose to exercise your sexual attractiveness
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.280]   for your own personal gratification,
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.600]   because that will harm your chances of marrying well.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.040]   (mouse clicking)
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.400]   That choice will have to be up to you,
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.800]   because if you do those other things
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.920]   that I've talked about, developing wealth,
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.440]   physical attractiveness, integrity and character, et cetera,
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:43.140]   if you do those things, you'll have huge options,
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.160]   you'll have huge attractiveness in the sexual marketplace.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.920]   But if you indulge widely in the sexual marketplace
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.880]   without focusing on marriage,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.120]   you won't be able to find an excellent wife,
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.700]   because she will reject you.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.580]   Not because you're not attractive,
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.000]   not because you're not rich,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.040]   but because she wants the trifecta.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.640]   Now, I just simply tell you this.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.880]   You should, as always, judge anything that I have said
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.260]   on your own, analyze it and judge it.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.840]   But I'm in my mid-30s now,
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.340]   and I have watched the life course of many of my peers.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.140]   I'm in a unique stage at this point in time
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.680]   where I should be, or I think I am,
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.740]   relatable still to young men.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.160]   I might sound like a curmudgeon,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.760]   but I don't look quite like a gray-haired, bearded curmudgeon.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.440]   I'm a red-haired, bearded curmudgeon.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.960]   So I understand I've been there.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.160]   I can talk to a 15-year-old and clearly understand
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.640]   and remember where I was at 15.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.600]   I won't be able to do that when I'm 60.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.440]   But I'm also in an interesting change,
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.800]   in an interesting phase where I have watched
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.440]   the US-American culture change drastically,
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.600]   and my lifetime is the time that it's happened in.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.920]   And I can watch my peers, my friends,
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.360]   who have made different choices,
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.020]   and I can see the clear outcome of their lives.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.480]   If you want to marry well, you will need to be careful,
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.880]   and you will need to do things differently
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.100]   than most of your peers.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:34.600]   If you don't wanna marry well, fine, do whatever you like.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.040]   But if you wanna marry well,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.080]   you will need to do things differently.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.480]   I come back, as promised, to a brief discussion of age.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.980]   My hope is that young men listen to this show,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:55.760]   because you have a major benefit if you marry young.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.960]   Caution is warranted.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.000]   I will caution you.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.480]   Separately, I'll talk about what to look for in a woman.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.440]   Anticipate doing that.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.520]   I'll share with you what I think is important
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.640]   for you to consider.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.680]   I'll talk with you about how to find a woman.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.400]   But at the end of the day, I am watching
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.080]   almost every one of my friends who is in their mid-30s
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.160]   who wants to be married
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.460]   have a very difficult time finding a suitable wife,
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.880]   having a very difficult time finding an excellent wife.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.600]   Now, there is plenty of sexual activity available
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.880]   to men in their 30s,
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.940]   but there's not a lot of excellent women who are not taken.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.120]   And so one of your major competitive advantages
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.200]   that you can develop is if you as a young man
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.480]   develop these qualities, wealth or ambition,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.680]   ambition and personal integrity,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.360]   character on the way to wealth,
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.880]   putting in place the framework that will eventually lead
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.240]   to wealth in your life, physical attractiveness,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.160]   developing physical strength, et cetera,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.720]   and integrity and character,
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.200]   you'll have a very wide selection
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.700]   of suitable marriage candidates when you're young,
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.160]   very wide.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.360]   And because you will basically have the pick of the crop,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.480]   so to speak, because you'll be an attractive man,
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.520]   then you can choose well
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.800]   and you can marry very discriminatingly well,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.520]   which is incredibly helpful.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.860]   But in order to do that,
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.560]   you'll have to have the clarity of mind.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.700]   You'll have to have settled the question
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.020]   of whether you want to marry.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.900]   You'll have to have settled some of those things in advance
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.900]   and be much more self-aware than I was when I was 18.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.900]   Much more self-aware than most of my friends were
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.080]   when we were 21.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.140]   There are huge advantages to marrying young.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.100]   Back to wealth.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.860]   When you marry young,
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.940]   so many things in life are better, cheaper,
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.020]   you'll have more energy,
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.020]   and the adventure of life that you can go on with your wife
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:08.020]   is so richly fulfilling, so deeply fulfilling and rewarding.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.340]   And if you can do it without all of the extraneous baggage,
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.100]   friend, it is excellent.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.740]   It's truly excellent.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.460]   I did not have all of these qualities when I was younger.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.500]   I was not rich when I was younger,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.740]   made a ton of financial mistakes.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.260]   Thankfully, I had a lot of the knowledge about those things
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.260]   and I had some good habits
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.860]   that were instilled into me by my parents,
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.620]   but I wasn't rich.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.700]   I wasn't particularly physically attractive.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.600]   I wasn't particularly ugly,
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.700]   but I also wasn't particularly physically attractive.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.140]   My strength was in the area of character and integrity,
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.400]   but I didn't do everything intentionally.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.020]   And there was a phase in my life
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.920]   that I was determined to pursue
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.460]   the path of sexual hedonism
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.220]   rather than the path of marriage.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:59.140]   I thank God that I was insufferably terrible at it.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.820]   I was a beta male through and through,
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.300]   and I was all the ladies' friends,
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.440]   and I was none of their sexual partners.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.180]   Today, I am thankful.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.740]   I literally view it as I was sovereignly protected,
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.380]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.640]   Now, at the time, I wasn't particularly happy about it,
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.780]   but today I'm deeply grateful for that
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.380]   because my wife, she's the only woman in the world
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:26.840]   that I have ever slept with.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.000]   And me, I'm the only man in the world
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.300]   that she's ever been with.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.840]   And the richness and the peace in our relationship
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.800]   that has come from that.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.120]   We met when we were fairly young.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.520]   We didn't marry until we were later.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.000]   I wish I'd married older.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.400]   I wish I'd married younger.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.100]   But because so much of our experience of life
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.840]   was shared experience,
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.600]   we have almost no conflict in our marriage.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.760]   We argue about English grammar.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.320]   I jokingly say, but it's true,
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.340]   like we argue about English grammar.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.440]   So many of the conflicts that I observe
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.880]   in my friends' marriages and their lives,
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.200]   so many of the emotional insecurities
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.360]   that so many women have,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.400]   so many of the, just the personal,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.480]   again, personal insecurities that so many women have
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.780]   that reflect in contentious fights with their husbands.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.520]   It is really, really tough.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.660]   It's so tough.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.660]   And if you're looking to have a rich
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.720]   and rewarding and fulfilling life,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.000]   you can avoid so many of those things.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.120]   Now, just because a woman has emotional insecurities
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.360]   or just because she has a checkered past,
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.680]   that shouldn't be a disqualifying thing.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.440]   Thank God, repentance is available.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.000]   The things of the past can be forgotten.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.480]   I have friends who before,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.880]   I have friends who,
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   one of their wives, before she was a Christian,
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.160]   she just had the worst life.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.380]   And thank God, God can change all those things.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.720]   All those things can be forgiven.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.740]   They can be cleared.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.180]   Christ's forgiveness is true, it's real,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.500]   but it still brings challenges.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.360]   You can work through them,
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   but don't set out with the goal of saying,
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.000]   I'm gonna take on a challenging charity situation
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.120]   and work through it.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.480]   Start with the very best.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.280]   Start with the ideal.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.200]   I just wanna give you that personal testimony
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.600]   that if you will be careful about how you marry,
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.760]   if you will avoid, if you'll choose,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.400]   I mean, it sounds silly,
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.040]   but my wife and I,
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.720]   because both of us have a focus on the habits
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.200]   that lead to wealth,
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.620]   we don't argue about money.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.760]   With, and I'd say that about 98%.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.880]   I mean, we still have our disagreements,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.160]   but those disagreements are minor.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.400]   And because they're so minor,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.740]   it's easy for us to just ignore them.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:05.480]   I would be much more aggressive about debt than my wife is.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.560]   I'm the financial planner, she's not.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.360]   Now, that's a good thing for me,
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.280]   that she doesn't wanna have any debt,
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.800]   because I probably would have been bankrupt
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.040]   if I weren't married to her,
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   just 'cause of how easily exposed I am
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.140]   to the hardcore scenarios.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.840]   But those things are minor.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.080]   It's not a big deal.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.520]   So, but if you can avoid the conflicts,
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.240]   if you can avoid the problems,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.360]   your life can be built together
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.120]   and you can build on a strong foundation.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.640]   I don't have anything more to say other than to say,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.760]   as someone who's not yet your grandfather,
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.060]   if you are a young man,
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.600]   I'm here to tell you that if you will choose
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.240]   an excellent wife,
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:49.180]   if you will choose an excellent wife,
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.500]   she will indeed be far more precious to you than money.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:59.480]   You will indeed be safely able to trust in her,
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   absolute trust,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.960]   and you will indeed have no lack of gain.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.640]   Now, on the flip side,
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.040]   if you are stupid about this decision
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.960]   and you just marry somebody because they came along
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.840]   and you weren't careful in discerning
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.000]   and discriminating and thoughtful in your decision-making,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.680]   well, you might be up on your house rooftop
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.120]   eating a crust of bread, frustrated at your nagging wife,
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.560]   and you won't be happy about that.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.160]   Choose carefully.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.200]   In summary, if you will pursue these things,
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.480]   be a man, grow up and be a man,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   build wealth or be on the path to building wealth,
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.520]   become as physically attractive
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.280]   as your personal face and body will allow,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.640]   be physically strong,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.920]   be a man of integrity and character,
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.200]   all of these things, of course,
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.660]   leading to be a man of brimming confidence,
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:09.920]   you will be very attractive to women.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.720]   If you will maintain your personal sexual purity,
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.120]   you will be very attractive to an excellent woman
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:22.720]   who will not come with a train car of baggage,
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.320]   both emotional and physical, attached to her,
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.680]   and then you'll be able to marry well
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.060]   and build life together.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:38.400]   You cannot think that you will fool an excellent woman.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.920]   You can't play a trick.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.080]   You can't flash the credit card,
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.440]   drive around in the leased car,
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.840]   show up in the rented house
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.480]   and have her think that you're actually wealthy.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.180]   An excellent woman will see right through that facade.
