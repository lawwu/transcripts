If you'll set a clear course for your own life, your own personal goals, you'll have plenty of marriage prospects available to you if you want them. Now you may not want them. You might choose to never marry. There are many men who make that choice and I don't think it's a foolish choice. It is better for you to never marry than to marry a non-excellent woman.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.240]  . That will suit you if you never marry. That will help you to enjoy a life of singleness as a single man, but it will also be extremely attractive to excellent women and you will have plenty of marriage prospects. I can quit with that. If you'll take just the simple, undefined language that I used of "Be a man. Grow up and be a man."
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:43.420]  , that means to you, that's enough. But I want to give you a few more points. If you would like to develop, sorry, if you would like to attract to you an excellent wife, it will help you to be rich. It will also help you at least to be on your way to being rich. Wealth is extremely attractive to women. Wealth is extremely attractive to women.

[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:55.220]   I do believe at this point that a cautionary statement is warranted I think it's wise to be careful in how you display the symbols of wealth so that you send the right signals to the right women here I think it's a major danger to focus just on flashy ostentatious displays of wealth.

[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:05.060]   because if you do that you run the risk of attracting a woman who is interested in flashy ostentatious displays of wealth.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.900]   Unfortunately especially at a young age flashy ostentatious displays of wealth don't actually lead to becoming wealthy.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.980]   Unfortunately especially at a young age flashy ostentatious displays of wealth don't actually lead to becoming wealthy.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.580]   Simple example would be an automobile of course this is changing in the modern culture but traditionally in US American culture the car that you drive says a lot about you.

[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.500]   to marry is one who has
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.740]   maintained her own sexual purity.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.780]   Now, why would you expect her to do that
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   if you don't expect yourself to do that?
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.780]   So you need to make a commitment to maintain
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:31.080]   your sexual purity until marriage.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:39.100]   That's a hard decision.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.360]   And that decision will only come out of your own
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:43:09.500]  , your own clear understanding of, uh, right and wrong,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:09.500]   of your worldview and of your own personal decision of the impact.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:39.540]   So you don't necessarily have to adopt that to see the wisdom of it.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:39.540]   Meaning that I believe any sexual contact outside of a one man, one woman relationship for a marriage relationship for life is sin. It's a violation of God's law and it will be judged as sin by God. But you can see the wisdom of that, even if you don't personally embrace my own understanding of the source of that wisdom. Again, the kind of woman that you would actually want to marry is one who's maintained her own sexual purity.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:53.580]   So if she's played the harlot for many years and then decided to settle down, which is very common among the, uh, in, in the ways that women's sexual cycles work over the course of their lifetime, especially in our modern era, why would you be attracted to her?
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:09.580]   It's very common, especially in the hypersexualized culture of the United States of America, that women will spend years behaving like a whore and then finally decide, okay, I want to find a good man and settle down.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:09.580]   And then finally decide, okay, I want to find a good man and settle down.
