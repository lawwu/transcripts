[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.280]   I struggle with social media
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.960]   and I struggle with just how much pain people are in.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   And if there's one message I would like to push out there,
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.480]   you're responsible, everybody, all of us,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960]   myself included, with struggling.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.640]   Struggle, struggle mightily because you,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.920]   it's nobody else's job to do your struggle for you.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.660]   Now with that said, if you're struggling
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.720]   and you're trying and you're trying to figure out
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.920]   how to better yourself and where you've failed,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   where you've let down your family, your friends,
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.900]   your workers, all this kind of stuff,
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.600]   give yourself a break.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240]   You know, if it's not working out,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   I have a lifelong relationship with failure and success.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.880]   There's been no period of my life
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.040]   where both haven't been present in one form or another.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.400]   And I do wish to say that a lot of times
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320]   people think this is glamorous.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.640]   I'm about to go do a show with Sam Harris.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880]   People are gonna listen in on two guys
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.400]   having a conversation on stage.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.640]   It's completely crazy.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.080]   I'm always trying to figure out how to make sure
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.420]   that those people get maximum value
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.340]   and that's why I'm doing this podcast.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600]   Just give yourself a break.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840]   You owe us your struggle.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   You don't owe your family or your coworkers
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.160]   or your lovers or your family members success.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.040]   As long as you're in there and you're picking yourself up,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   recognize that this new situation with the economy
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.400]   that doesn't have the juice to sustain our institutions
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.040]   has caused the people who've risen to the top
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   of those institutions to get quite brutal and cruel.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   Everybody's lying at the moment.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.140]   Nobody's really a truth teller.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.400]   Try to keep your humanity about you.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.140]   Try to recognize that if you're failing,
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.280]   if things aren't where you want them to be
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   and you're struggling and you're trying to figure out
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.780]   what you're doing wrong, what you could do,
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.640]   it's not necessarily all your fault.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.320]   We are in a global situation.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.400]   I have not met the people who are honest,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.560]   kind, good, successful.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.080]   Nobody that I've met is checking all the boxes.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.780]   Nobody's getting all 10s.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.680]   So I just think that's an important message
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.080]   that doesn't get pushed out enough.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.120]   Either people wanna hold society responsible
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.320]   for their failures, which is not reasonable.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.480]   You have to struggle, you have to try.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   Or they wanna say you're 100% responsible
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.760]   for your failures, which is total nonsense.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.920]   (silence)
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.080]   (silence)
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.240]   (silence)
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   (silence)
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.560]   (silence)
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.720]   (silence)
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.880]   (silence)
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
