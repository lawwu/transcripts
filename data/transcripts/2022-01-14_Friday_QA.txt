[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.760]   Today we begin with Vinny.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760]   Vinny in Brooklyn.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   Welcome, sir.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280]   Thank you so much for taking my call.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.720]   My question is regarding DIY projects.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.680]   I'm wondering if you have an objective or a formula to determine whether or not you
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.160]   should do a project yourself or whether you should pay someone to do it.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.640]   Long story short, I own a house.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   It's about two years.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   It's a little bit of a fixer upper and I live in a high cost of living area.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.720]   And right now there's unfortunately a little bit of tension with me and my wife because
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.200]   we're just trying to figure out how to get this stuff done here.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   And of course, contractors come to the house, everything's very expensive.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560]   They don't necessarily do the best job.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   But on the other hand, I don't have time really to do the work.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.960]   I guess it comes at the expense of relaxation.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.360]   So my question to you is, obviously I know it's more of a case by case basis question,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.600]   but is there an objective formula that we can start at whether or not to determine if
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   we should do DIY projects ourselves?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Thank you.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.860]   So the objective formula from a financial perspective is going to be your personal hourly
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.100]   rate versus the hourly rate that you're paying for the work that you're commissioning.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.320]   So if your personal hourly rate is $20 per hour and the contractor is going to charge
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   you $50 per hour, then objectively speaking, it's going to be much better for you to go
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.440]   ahead and do the work yourself because if you can do something close to the rate that
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.500]   the contractor can do it at, then you're going to be earning a higher hourly rate.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.520]   On the other hand, if your personal hourly rate is $500 per hour and the contractor will
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.020]   work for $50 per hour, then you're far better off going ahead and hiring the contractor
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.640]   to get those things done.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.560]   So that's the objective scenario.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.960]   You want to look at the opportunity costs and ask yourself, what am I giving up in order
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   to do this work?
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.240]   Now here's where things get tricky.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.840]   You have to ask yourself, what am I actually giving up?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.720]   So for example, if you have a job where you work 40 hours a week, Monday through Friday,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.360]   and your personal rate is $50, and let's drop it down.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.160]   Your personal rate is $30.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   No, let's do 50.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.740]   Your personal rate is $50 and you're going to pay someone else $50, but you could otherwise
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.920]   do it on a Saturday morning, then all of a sudden the financial considerations go out
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.960]   the window, right?
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.120]   Because if you were just going to sit around and do nothing on Saturday morning, or you're
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.200]   going to do something productive with your Saturday morning, it doesn't matter that your
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.580]   personal rate is the same as the contractor's.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.020]   It matters what is your alternative use of the time.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.100]   What would you be doing otherwise?
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.240]   So I think here you would want to do an analysis and say, do I really enjoy the work?
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.800]   Is the work something that I enjoy, that I want to do?
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.480]   Is it something that inspires me, or is it something that I just want to get as far away
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.780]   from as I possibly can?
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.840]   Some people come to DIY projects and they find them relaxing.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.320]   It's something that they enjoy doing.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.260]   They enjoy working with their hands.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.080]   They find it relaxing.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.440]   Many times this includes people who are knowledge workers.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   I personally often get frustrated that most of my work is not tangible, and so it's nice
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.600]   to do a project and build a deck on your house, and all of a sudden, look, I did that.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   I built that.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   It feels good to get some of those things done.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.980]   On the other hand, some people find them very draining.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.720]   You ask an entrepreneur who gets turned on by his business, and you say, "Now you're
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.980]   going to go home and work on a bathroom," a lot of times, for some people, that can
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.980]   be very draining.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.760]   So I would analyze not only the financial ramifications, but I would analyze and say,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.160]   how would I rank this activity?
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   Is this something that I enjoy?
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.040]   Is this something that I want to do?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.240]   I personally don't enjoy DIY projects.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.920]   I used to want to.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.280]   I did a lot of it when I was younger.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   I'm more capable than many people, but I don't enjoy doing it.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.180]   And so I've learned that I would rather spend my time doing something that is a better fit
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.760]   for me and then simply pay someone to do my DIY projects for me because the time that
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.000]   I spend on the DIY project is quite draining for me personally.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.540]   I don't find it rejuvenating.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.320]   I don't find it very rewarding.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.080]   I find it really frustrating a lot of times, and then that frustration kind of seeps over,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.240]   and it costs me my time and my mental energy in other aspects of my work.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.560]   I think another lens that you would look on is a lens with regard to safety and to, is
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.920]   this actually a good idea?
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.200]   Is this something that I can actually do?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.840]   For example, if you are someone who earns, let's say you use your body and you're an
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.200]   athlete, right, or you're a surgeon, something like this, it would be crazy for you to spend
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.800]   a lot of time doing things around equipment and machinery and roofs and eaves and ladders
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.440]   and nail guns and chainsaws and such, right?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.920]   Because if your body is injured in some way, then that has a much higher cost for you than
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.720]   it does to somebody whose body is not so highly paid.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.160]   And so you want to consider that as well.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.440]   I think finally, the big question is, what could you do with your energy and with your
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   time?
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.480]   If all of the projects were done around the house and your wife weren't as upset about
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.680]   how long things were taking, would that give you more mental space to be more productive?
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.400]   Some of us have very large opportunities for productivity.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.880]   We have high potential with our earnings, and if we could just put an extra 30 or 50
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.840]   or 100 hours into a project, it could be an extra five, six, or seven figures to our income.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:09.680]   And so that's a big, it's a big cost if doing a DIY project to save a few pennies keeps
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.920]   us from that very productive side.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   On the other hand, some people don't have such financial potential.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.880]   Their earning ability is more modest.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.240]   They don't have side work or they don't have projects that have exponential kind of financially
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.880]   explosive power.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.240]   And for those people, I think the return on investment of time and money on DIY projects
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.920]   is a good return.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.200]   But the absolute financial aspect is, how much would you be earning with the time that
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.440]   you don't put into a DIY project?
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.100]   How much is the DIY project going to cost you?
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.540]   And is it a better use of your time to make money, pay taxes, deal with expenses associated
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.600]   with that and then pay for it?
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.400]   Or is it better for you to simply do it yourself?
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.480]   Great, thank you.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.560]   The only minor complication, which obviously it's not a financial question, is that the
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.040]   people around here, you get people, you pay people to do a job and unfortunately, it just
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   really cut corners.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.360]   It seems that people don't really want to do a good job anymore.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.920]   But again, that's not a financial concern.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.880]   But anyway, I really, really appreciate your time and thank you for answering that.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   It really helps me.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.040]   I think that's a very valid reason why you might want to spend time doing something yourself.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.640]   If you get shoddy work and it's going to annoy you to have crooked tile joints and poor trim
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.920]   work and that's going to annoy you, then either you pony up and hire a very productive, highly
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.640]   qualified craftsman or you go ahead and just make it a side project as well.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   John of Pennsylvania, welcome to the show.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   Hey Joshua.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   Good analysis for the last person.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I fully agree on all those.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:57.960]   One way I've become better, if it helps the other guy, Vinny, one way I've felt better
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.720]   about paying contractors in the past or more recently, it's come to me, if I hire them
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.400]   and they show up with say three or four people to do a big job and they say it takes them
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.200]   three full days, I'll calculate all those man hours off and then I'll double it because
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.280]   my skill level probably isn't as good as theirs and I'll just calculate how many weeks that
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.880]   would have taken me to do something and then I see the true value in it.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.560]   Sometimes it's hard to see it when you're just looking at a number on a contract but
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.120]   shoddy quality is definitely something that makes you feel bad about paying contractors
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   for sure.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.520]   I think that's a good point and I think that happens to a lot of us.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   You look at a project and you say, "You know what?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.080]   This project should be simple."
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.600]   And all of a sudden you get into it and you need new tools and all of a sudden the project
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.240]   isn't simple and it takes you two or three times as long as it should have because of
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.080]   lack of experience.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.280]   And so I think the key is to recognize that we should all be grateful I think to live
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.160]   in an economy that runs based upon specialization of labor.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.940]   And that's the underlying aspect of what makes us so wealthy in the modern world is highly
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.160]   specialized economies and high specialization of labor.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:16.840]   As much as we appreciate I think sometimes the idea of a pastoral lifestyle and we think
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.600]   about how wonderful it would be to have a homestead in the country, if we didn't have
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.960]   a specialized workforce where we all worked with each other and collaborated based upon
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.040]   some personal unique area of labor, we would live in absolute poverty.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.080]   The poorest places in the world and the poorest lifestyles are always the people who try to
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.960]   do it all themselves.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   You go out in the country, you go up to Alaska and find a homesteader who's really committed
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.280]   to doing all his work himself.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.080]   The guy lives like a pauper.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.200]   It's just not a wealthy lifestyle.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.080]   And so if we reject that and we say, "I'm going to do it all myself," there's a good
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   chance we're going to wind up poorer.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.200]   And so I don't think that most of us when we look at a DIY project really want to go
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.320]   and say, "I'm going to be an off-the-grid homesteader doing everything myself."
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.680]   We just say, "I'm going to go ahead and redo my bathroom."
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:16.120]   And that's where I say there are elements of enjoyment and satisfaction, making yourself
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.680]   into a person of diverse skill sets, building up your... trying different things in the
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.880]   comfort of your own home where there's not a lot of pressure to see, "Hey, do I like
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.880]   this?
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.960]   Maybe I enjoy this.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.360]   Maybe this is an expression of my artistry and it brings me satisfaction to make my personal
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.880]   abode something that reflects my individual taste."
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.600]   Those are all good, valid reasons.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   But generally speaking, we want to work in our areas of specialty where we are the most
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.720]   productive, where we are the most appreciated, and then we want to let other people work
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.320]   in their areas of specialty and of genius because that's where we have the wealthiest
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   lifestyle.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   >>Trevor: Yeah.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.040]   I'm certainly guilty of romanticizing the off-grid homesteading lifestyle myself, but
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.440]   I know in the smarter part of my brain that's no way to live for me and I kind of shy away
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   from it.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   >>Trevor: The romantic...
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:18.240]   The very best off-grid lifestyle comes when you have some form of work that you really
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.200]   enjoy, be it doing scientific experiments or creating YouTube videos or writing the
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.840]   next greatest American novel, and you have a few hundred thousand dollars a year coming
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   in.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   That way you can buy all your toys, you can have your tractors, you can have all the
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.960]   people, and then you can give yourself the satisfaction of looking out over your flocks
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.400]   and your herds that other people take care of, and your beautifully painted stables,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.040]   et cetera, but it's all based upon that side income that comes from where you actually
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   earn a lot of money.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.720]   That's the best lifestyle to have.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   >>Joseph: Absolutely.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   And one kind of argument, there is one good reason to do it yourself on a lot of jobs
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.760]   is to know for sure you never want to do them again.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.120]   I refinished floors once and I was more than happy to pay for floor installation the next
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.200]   time rather than refinishing them because it almost killed me.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.040]   >>Trevor: Every time I talk about how I don't love DIY projects, I feel like I'm betraying
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.480]   my father a little bit, because one of the things that my dad worked hard when I was
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.280]   younger was, in addition to education, he worked hard to give us opportunities to do
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.040]   work and to do manual labor a lot.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.280]   So I spent a summer when I was in middle school, I spent a summer working for a tile setter
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.520]   as a helper on tile jobs.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.560]   I've spent time working on farms.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.320]   I've spent time doing construction work, various kinds of carpentry and all kinds of different
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   stuff.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.160]   I've done some electrical work here and there.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.000]   And so what I have learned from those things, every one of them is what I do not want to
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.880]   do and where I'm not good.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.560]   And in hindsight, I appreciate that I'm actually pretty capable.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.920]   I remember when I was a senior in high school, we got together to build our senior class
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.520]   float on a trailer to bring along behind.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.400]   And I was surprised, because I didn't think I was much of a carpenter, I was surprised
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:09.360]   that I was one of just a handful of guys who had a concept of basic construction techniques
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.200]   and how to drive a toenail into a piece of two by four and how to put something that's
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   not going to fall off, put together some random float that's going to actually hold together.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.320]   But I actually consider it a very good part of my experience that I've done enough of
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.720]   those kinds of jobs to know that I do not want to do those things for the rest of my
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   life.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:37.160]   And so it motivated me to not spend my time there, because I just found it so physically
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.080]   draining and mentally boring.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.520]   And that was a useful skill for me.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.680]   So I hope to impart the same lessons to my children to either give them the chance to
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.000]   say, "Hey, my children are good at working with their hands and they find great satisfaction
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.360]   in it and they're good at it," or to learn the same lessons that I personally have learned.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   Go ahead with your comment of the day, John.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   Yeah, we'll do it.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:06.160]   I just run my kids a little house in the prairie and I felt very humbled by how much stuff
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.800]   the father could do and build the house and everything and all the different skills he
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.240]   had, for sure.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.640]   But yeah, my question is kind of just a boring one about real estate.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.360]   But I think I know the proper answer.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.400]   I figured I'd run it by you.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.320]   My in-laws have a house that they bought from another family member about nine or 10 years
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   ago.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   It wasn't bought because they intended to keep it for an investment.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.440]   It was just kind of a circumstance in the family that they ended up buying this house.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.480]   It's very close to where they live, right across the street, in fact.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.320]   It's appreciated quite a bit.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.480]   And now they're getting to the point where they don't...
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.200]   I don't think they ever really wanted to have a rental home, but it's appreciated quite
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   a bit.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:56.080]   And some of the other factors, like having a person in the family to do all the repairs,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.640]   he's getting a bit older and not as nimble as he used to be to be able to get over and
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   do all those repairs.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.400]   So some things that made it attractive to be an unintended landlord are kind of falling
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   away.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.080]   And I simply told them, "It's probably just time to sell it."
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.040]   Some of the kids are talking about what they're missing out on there.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.000]   And the way I could describe it to them, I think I'm correct in saying that, well, they're
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.480]   going to miss out rather than their parents keeping it until they die and passing it on
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.320]   to the children to get the step-up value, which right now I think it has gained somewhere
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.360]   in the 350,000 mark.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   That is significant and they could save a lot of taxes on that, but that's really the
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.400]   only thing I can see as a benefit.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:41.600]   And if you're talking about 15% capital gains tax, somewhere in the order of $50,000, I
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:49.120]   said, "Is that really worth it for your parents to keep a house that they really don't necessarily
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   want to or need to keep?"
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.040]   And I think no, but obviously it's their decision to make.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.160]   So I don't know if there's any other thoughts I need to bring to the table there to give
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.760]   them a full breadth of the conversation or if I'm thinking about that correctly.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.320]   What do you think would happen to the money if the house were sold?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   What do you think would happen with the money, the profits?
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.720]   It would go to help the parents have a probably more secure retirement, although they're very
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   good savers.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.360]   I don't think they're in any jeopardy of having a bad retirement.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.800]   They're just getting to retirement age, by the way.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.280]   And I think one of them is still working part-time just to have something to do.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.520]   The other one's in her first year of retirement and who knows if she'll go back to work or
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   whatever.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   But I think they're fairly good financially, so it might just go to a net thing.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.280]   Maybe it would go to some less desirable trades.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   Maybe they'd gamble away.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   I don't know.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.800]   But I don't think it's necessary for their financial security if that's the case.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.920]   Well, here are the things that go through my mind.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:04.040]   Taxes are a question, but I think you're right to demote that to a relatively low importance
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   because you're talking about long-term capital gains, taxes.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.600]   Depending on how good their records are, yes, they may have some gain, but it's not going
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.760]   to be that big of a deal.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.680]   My first question is what happens to the money?
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:24.800]   The beautiful thing about real estate is, especially for normal people who aren't engaged
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:31.240]   in just every couple of years borrowing every last penny of equity out of their property,
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.720]   real estate allows people to have an asset that produces an income where they don't spend
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.680]   the principal.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   That's a uniquely beneficial thing for many people.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.820]   That's also beneficial with children.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.240]   You mentioned the children, which is why I wondered what the ownership here is.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.960]   It's really nice if you have an asset that can't be sold, especially when you're thinking
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.840]   about multi-generational planning.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.960]   It's nice if you have an asset that is worth a lot of money but can't really be sold and
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.060]   won't be sold because it has some kind of value to the family.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:11.240]   That allows the family to maintain wealth but not to fritter it away.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   Cash is wonderful, but cash spends really easily.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.720]   Real estate doesn't spend very easily.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.080]   So I ask myself, is this the kind of property that should be sold or is this because we
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.520]   don't need it anymore and it was a good move but it's not useful now?
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.440]   Or is this the kind of property that shouldn't be sold because it would be useful to have
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.780]   in the family and to have as a piece of wealth that could continue to produce dividends down
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.440]   through the ages?
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   This next question I ask myself is, could this real estate fill a unique role in the
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   retirement and financial planning of the parents who own it?
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.200]   The nice thing, related to what I just said, the nice thing about real estate is in an
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:03.480]   ideal scenario, if I could have every retirement planning client that I encounter have a handful
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:12.440]   of houses and the bulk of their assets in mutual funds, stocks, etc., I would be tickled
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:19.720]   pink because what happens is those houses balance people's concerns in a way that the
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:27.200]   paper assets, which are non-tangible and feel risky to people, those houses are more familiar
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   to them.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.640]   And so when markets are down, as a financial planner, and you're talking to someone and
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.520]   you're saying, "Listen, markets are down 30%, markets are down 40%, there's fear everywhere,
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.680]   don't sell, don't sell," it's nice to say, "Look, you guys over here, you've got $4,000
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.880]   coming in from your rental real estate portfolio, you're fine, right?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.600]   You don't need to have all this.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.760]   Just ignore the statements for the next year.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   Let's let this market clear, let's just relax."
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:58.600]   And so the fact that the houses are usually uncorrelated, and I don't want to misstate
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.760]   that, let's just say less correlated to things like large equity markets, etc., and then
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.000]   also the fact that they're tangible, that people understand them in a way that nobody
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.880]   understands stocks and mutual funds, then I like that from a diversification perspective.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.840]   And so I think it's valuable to have, and for the reasons stated, that it's nice to
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.080]   have that income that comes in, it's nice to know there's a bunch of gains sitting there,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   it's nice to know we have a paid-off house that we could access if we needed it.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.800]   That said, I think people often find themselves to either be real estate people or not to
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.440]   be real estate people.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.720]   And it sounds like these people might not be real estate people.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   Like, "Okay, well we bought it because it showed up and it's actually turned out to
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.880]   be a good move, but we don't really want to be real estate people in the future."
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.280]   In my experience, many people, once they buy a house, they quickly learn, meaning a rental
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.040]   house, and they go through it for a couple of years, they quickly find out either, "Yeah,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.600]   I can handle this, I can learn these skills, and I'm good at it, I'm a real estate guy,"
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   or "I'm not, I don't want to deal with it."
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.680]   In that case, I say sell the house, put the money in mutual funds, and go on.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.400]   Because if they're looking for productive assets that don't require the difficulty,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.640]   don't require the time, don't require the trips to Home Depot, etc., then I think certainly
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.720]   there's no question that mutual funds are superior, vastly superior, to that piece of
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.360]   real estate.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.520]   But those are the additional questions that I would ask.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.920]   Is this going to be a useful part of their portfolio, etc.?
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:38.680]   I think that, as a financial planner, you recognize that people who just have one or
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:46.200]   two houses often don't, they often significantly underperform capital markets, but I still
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:52.880]   feel like it brings a good amount of mental security to people to know, "I have this house
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.440]   here that's available for me that's creating rental income."
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.520]   So I can't give you a clear yes or no, but that is what I think about.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.880]   No, that's a good way to think about it.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.320]   It's a good thing to consider the realness of it.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   While they're good savers, I wouldn't say they're financially savvy as far as anything
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   regarding markets.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.480]   It's all a big mystery to them.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   So having something real could help them mentally in the future.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.040]   It's a good aspect of what I'll bring up.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.680]   Super dangerous for people to say it's all a mystery to me.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.920]   It's really dangerous, right?
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:32.560]   Because what happens is they can take advantage of it really easily, and they can do dumb
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.200]   things because, "Oh, it's all a mystery to me."
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.560]   And so this is one of the reasons why I think that real estate has been so productive at
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.320]   helping people build wealth.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.960]   It has such big dollar signs behind it.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.000]   People understand it intuitively because they've always lived in houses.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.200]   They understand the value that a house has.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   They know a market.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.360]   They understand what's necessary.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.840]   Houses are big dollar figure things, so they're hard to sell.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.040]   They're expensive to sell.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.640]   People don't just freak out when the market goes down 5%.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.400]   They don't get marked to the market every day.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   You don't get a statement every day on your iPhone telling you, "Here's what your house
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   is worth."
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.560]   And so because of that benign neglect, real estate generally works out for people.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:19.140]   Whereas with stocks and mutual funds, for the unsophisticated, they often wind up making
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.920]   these errors when they could be avoided if they would just apply that same principle
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   of benign neglect.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   Jim Collins: Sure.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   Yeah, no, good talk, man.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   I appreciate all that.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   Thank you.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.480]   Peter T. Leeson, Jr.: Well, thank you for helping them to think it through clearly and
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.800]   helping them to come to a good decision.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   We go to 703.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   Welcome to the show.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   How can I serve you today?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   Jim Collins, Jr.: Hi, Joshua.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.360]   My name is Jim, and I have a, I hope, quick question for you.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:52.660]   The synopsis is my dad is trying to convert his SEP IRA to Roth, do a Roth conversion
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.340]   on it, a little bit of an amount per year.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.420]   The little background on him, 70-year-old single, only on Social Security, so he doesn't
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.820]   have to file a tax return now.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.060]   Obviously, will when he has to start taking RMDs or he starts converting.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.000]   He's got a SEP IRA, all taxable, approximately a million dollars.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.720]   For him, RMDs will start at 72 instead of 70.5.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:24.400]   He's looking at doing the Roth conversion, and let's see, he's aware the Roth conversion
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.640]   is going to count as income, and he's going to have to file tax returns.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:35.360]   Wants to stay in the no higher than 24% bracket, which is about 170 for a single person, because
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.680]   when he takes his regular RMDs, which is going to be about $40,000 to $50,000 a year, that's
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   automatically going to put him in the 22% bracket.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:52.120]   He figures that the 24% bracket is marginal cost to get the benefits of a Roth.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:00.280]   The real question for you is, do you see, what downsides are there to this?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.880]   Before I answer that, what upside is he hoping to get?
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.760]   Why does he think that he's served well by a Roth conversion?
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.160]   My brothers and I are the beneficiaries of it.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.640]   He does not pull money out of it.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.560]   I cannot convince him to take a dollar out of it, and he's basically looking to pass
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.640]   it on to us.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.720]   All three of us are going to be in the 22% or higher bracket, and he figures if it can
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:38.120]   grow tax free over the next, he's estimating 10 years, he just thinks that he's a very
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:46.760]   anti-tax guy, and he just thinks that this is going to be a better option for him to
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.160]   give to us, so we don't have to pay taxes on it later.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:57.360]   He hopes to start converting it now at about $150,000 a year, and then he can get it all
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.520]   converted to Roth, it'll grow a bit, and then everything's tax free after that.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:12.160]   So I think that that answer that you gave is the answer that makes this a good move.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:18.720]   Meaning what he's trying to do is he's trying to pay taxes at a predictable rate that he
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.440]   can control now based upon the amount of money that he converts, and he's trying to move
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.200]   it into a Roth IRA where he won't have to take required minimum distributions with the
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   goal that he lives a long and healthy life for his entire lifetime.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.760]   He gets to enjoy that money being tax free, and then at his death, then you would be the
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:47.960]   beneficiaries of the Roth IRA, and you would be able to maintain that tax free nature for
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.560]   a significant amount of time depending on what the actual rules are at the time of his
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.560]   death based upon the inheritance of a Roth IRA.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.920]   I say that because this is one of those areas where there's certain to be change, right?
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.520]   Traditionally we would say, "Well, you could put it into a stretch IRA and take it out,"
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.920]   and then in the recent round of tax legislation, there were some new rules imposed, and so
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.120]   we don't know what those rules are going to be 30 years from now.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.920]   All we know is that if he keeps it in the SEP IRA and then he dies, then you as the
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.120]   beneficiaries will have to pay full income taxes on it as you take it out.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:32.040]   Of course, you can still do some stretch IRA calculations, et cetera, and also we know
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.320]   that if he keeps it in the SEP IRA, he'll have to start doing required minimum distribution.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.720]   I think that here this is a good reason to do a distribution.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.400]   So now the question you asked me is what are the downsides?
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.960]   I'd say number one downside would just be that you're going ahead and locking in the
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:30:00.220]   taxes now, and is it possible that instead of taxes going up in the future, that taxes
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.480]   go down in the future or that there's some other wrinkle that comes out?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.460]   That's unknowable, and so you always hate to pay taxes.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.720]   If there's ever a time when you can defer taxes to the future, you always try to do
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   that.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.320]   So in this case, this is one of those questions where maybe something changes in the future,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.200]   but of course, I think it's unlikely.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.440]   So that's not really a downside.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   Go ahead.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:31.760]   He and I have spoken about that, the future risk, and he and I are both, as I think you've
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.840]   said in the past time or two, that overall tax rates may go up and down and so on and
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   so forth.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:48.600]   But in general, they generally don't fluctuate a dramatic amount to make a huge difference.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.480]   There's a time or two in history that it has, but over the last 20, 25 years, our tax bracket
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:31:03.120]   has stayed fairly stable within reason for up to $150,000 to $200,000 a year.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:11.680]   Typically on those that make more, it fluctuates more, but for the middle class, it seems to
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.880]   be fairly stable over the last 20, 25 years.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   Exactly.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   I concur with that.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:25.560]   That is my personal analysis as well, that any changes have generally shown themselves
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.520]   to be fairly small.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:34.200]   There are changes at the margin, and it seems to me that the taxing authorities feel like
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.600]   they've pretty well dialed in their Laffer curve, that they're at the optimal amount
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.080]   to get the most tax revenue out of the population with the least amount of noise.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:49.680]   And so taxes are a political tool that politicians press on, that we're going to raise taxes
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.480]   on the rich, we're going to lower taxes on business people and on the middle class, et
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   cetera.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.800]   And so when they actually have the opportunity to pass legislation, generally it seems like
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.960]   they're unpersuaded to make any significant changes.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.400]   And so the changes are relatively small, and I think it's simply because they've honed
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.080]   in on the fact that we've got a precisely very efficient tax code.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.040]   I think it's, I say from personal experience, that this is true.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.980]   I find the United States kind of maddening, because the taxes are not so low that you
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.840]   just feel like, you know what, it's wonderful, I'm in the best place in the world because
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.600]   I'm in tax haven.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.760]   On the other hand, they're not so high that they're so uncomfortable that they push you
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   out.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.960]   There's some people, some people, not all, most people just live where they live because
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.280]   they like being there.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.600]   But some people will leave Sweden or leave Holland to go somewhere else, leave the Netherlands
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.160]   to go somewhere else.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.260]   But very rarely does anybody leave the United States for tax planning.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.160]   And so they've kind of got this sweet middle zone success story where we're not too high,
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.380]   we're not too low, and we get a lot of tax revenue out.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.700]   So I think that they've dialed in that they're happy with where things are at.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.940]   I don't see many downsides.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:13.260]   I think that this is an appropriate situation to do the conversion.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:21.400]   I think that your father's intention for you to inherit the money in the best way possible
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.580]   is excellent.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.920]   The only thing that tickles at the back of my head is I would look to see if he's charitably
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:36.160]   minded and ask myself, does he have any personal charitable goals that he would like to use
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:43.880]   this SEP IRA to fund in addition to an inheritance for his children?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:49.080]   Because if he set up a charitable organization, even if that was his own fund or made some
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.340]   kind of charitable transfer with a direct transfer of the SEP IRA, I think that would
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.960]   be a superior move from a tax perspective.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.680]   But beyond that, I think your analysis is good, and I think this is a good situation
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.160]   for a Roth conversion.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   Great.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   Thank you.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.640]   I've got one more question in relation to this.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.040]   At $1 million a year, he's 70.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:17.120]   He's got two years before he has to take RMD.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:23.400]   So assuming he does this at $150,000 a year over the next two years, that's going to reduce
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.640]   the IRA without any growth or anything down to $700,000.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:34.000]   Now, from my understanding, if you can confirm this, I'd appreciate it.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.840]   After he's 72, he's going to take his RMD of about $28,000 to $30,000 a year based on
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   the $700,000.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.320]   And he can still do, above that, he can still do Roth conversions after he has started his
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   RMD.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.680]   Am I thinking that's correct?
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.200]   You can do Roth conversions any time that you want.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   Absolutely.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.400]   There's no problem there at all.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.680]   But your RMD cannot count as part of that Roth conversion, is my understanding.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   That's my understanding as well.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.160]   Yeah, the RMDs have to go into a taxable account.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.920]   And if he doesn't have earned income, then those RMDs would have to go into the taxable
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920]   account.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.200]   So correct, that's my understanding.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.800]   And along those same lines, say in two years at $700,000, he starts his RMD, which is going
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.320]   to be about $30,000 a year, fall apart.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:37.120]   If he then does an extra $100,000 a year, will his RMDs from 72 to say 77, will his
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.520]   RMDs go down because that's recalculated every year?
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.520]   Yes.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.000]   Because the balance is much lower?
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Yes.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Awesome.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Great.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Josh, thank you so much.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.400]   You've answered all my questions.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.080]   And I just wanted to, it's a big financial move for my dad.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:01.280]   He's worked in the oil field forever and he just had, he was looking for some maybe confirmation
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.840]   bias, if you will.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:08.000]   But if nothing else, he was just looking to bounce some ideas and I figured I'd give you
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   a call.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.320]   And I want to say thank you for doing this for your Patreon people.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.840]   It's a very valuable thing.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.600]   And I think that the Patreon cost is well worth, well underpaid for what the information
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   I received today.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   So thank you.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   I'm going to go.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.160]   I tell people and sometimes it seems like they don't understand.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.320]   The cheapest way to talk to me, as long as you don't mind someone hearing the sound of
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.600]   your voice and airing out and my choosing how long it is, the cheapest way to talk to
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.680]   me is to jump on one of these Friday Q&A calls.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.680]   And with that we go to Kristen.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   Kristen, welcome to the show.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.680]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.680]   Thank you so much for taking my call.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.080]   This is very exciting for me.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.040]   I'm a brand new Patreon.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:02.640]   So my question is, I am thinking of buying a vacation home abroad somewhere in Central
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   America and my interest is peaked in El Salvador because my husband and I are Bitcoiners and
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.160]   we love the idea of maybe a plan B residence over there.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.640]   The housing is affordable at this time and we might want to possibly retire there.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   But most of all, it would just be a vacation home and hopefully something that we could
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.440]   rent out.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:40.760]   So we basically saved up $100,000 to put toward it so far, which is not enough, I think, to
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.160]   pay a full cash value.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:49.800]   So my question is, should we keep saving up and just wait for the right time or should
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.040]   we take some financing?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.720]   What's an appropriate amount of money to spend on something like this?
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:01.680]   It does seem very luxurious purchase that we're not used to buying, but we are debt
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   free.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.720]   We're actually homesteaders in the country.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   Great.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.440]   Which is kind of funny.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.960]   After my homesteader bashing.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:16.000]   Oh yeah, and we love it, but my husband does have a day job and we do hire people.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.480]   I just wrote a big fat check today for a fencer.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.120]   But anyway, just kind of wanting to get some advice from someone who's not trying to sell
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:32.680]   us a home abroad and maybe a little pep talk about how to make this purchase appropriately
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.760]   in a way that's not going to stress me out, in a way that's not going to make me regret
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.080]   that I did this.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.720]   And another thing, because we are homesteaders, it's not really possible to spend a huge amount
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.840]   of time out there at the moment.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.520]   We could probably get away for a couple weeks a year.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.840]   So I don't know if that affects your answer.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.000]   Do you like going to El Salvador?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.360]   I've never been.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.360]   That's step one.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.160]   I like going to Costa Rica.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.240]   That's step one, because you want to make sure, if you're going to buy a vacation home,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.280]   you want to make sure that you buy somewhere that you like and that you're actually going
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.960]   to go and do it, especially when you're thinking about doing it abroad.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.320]   Where in the United States is your primary homestead?
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   What region?
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.000]   We're in southeastern Arizona.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.120]   So just trying to think of flights in and out of Central America.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.560]   You would always have to connect through either LA or Texas or Florida from Arizona.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.000]   I doubt there are any direct flights.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Is that right?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.800]   Okay.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.160]   So here are some of the questions that I would raise.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.640]   And I would be cautious and slow to do it.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.440]   And I'll give you some arguments as to why for you to consider.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   The second question, do you speak Spanish or does your husband speak Spanish?
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.520]   No, but I'm trying to learn.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   Good.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.840]   Third question, if you did buy a property, not having yet gone there, describe to me
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.200]   what your dream property would look like.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.880]   I'm actually looking at a development.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.160]   So my dream property would be turnkey.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.440]   That included a property manager, because I don't want to be a hands-on landlord.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:35.680]   It would be like a tiny house or a little surf cottage by the beach.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.040]   Okay.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:46.360]   So something not in a condominium, not a big building, but some kind of freestanding structure.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.960]   And you want a freestanding house, but in a development that somebody is developing
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.440]   as a centrally planned community?
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.240]   Yes, exactly.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.040]   I have my eye on one that's in development right now.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.280]   And it's a series of tiny homes.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.920]   How much are they asking for those?
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:11.880]   Anywhere between $125 to $175.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:18.400]   So what you're considering is not wrong.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.260]   I would caution you and I would say that you want to be very clear on what you're actually
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:30.360]   paying for, and I'll give you some insight into the Central American marketplace.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.960]   So to begin with, if you're going to choose a vacation home, you need to choose a place
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.080]   that you actually like.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:43.800]   And I would really want you to spend several significant vacations in this place before
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.660]   you actually committed to a house.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.680]   And make sure that you actually like going there.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:56.520]   And that liking going there needs to be everything associated with liking going there.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.280]   Meaning, that's why I asked about airline connections, right?
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.200]   Do you want to connect through?
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.880]   It's kind of a hassle if you have to fly from Tucson to Houston and all of the connections
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   are stink, right?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.860]   Or you fly from Tucson to Miami, there is probably a two and a half hour flight.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.180]   And then you sit in Miami for four hours, and then it's another two and a half hours
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.420]   from Miami back west to El Salvador, and now to get back and forth is a whole day's travel
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.440]   and it's really annoying to you.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.880]   On the other hand, if you could find something that's a direct two hour shot, then that's
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.600]   a much lower and a much easier thing to do.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.560]   One of the things that you need to be very aware of when dealing with Central America
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.800]   specifically, and this is true in many places outside the United States, not all, but it
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.720]   is definitely true in Central America.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:51.240]   Property does not move fast like you're accustomed to in the United States.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.800]   The values thus are very hard to say.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.080]   In the United States, especially right now, you can sell a property and you can know a
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.680]   good idea of what the price is.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.440]   You can sell a property in a couple of weeks.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.880]   I don't know of anywhere in the United States that has a slow real estate market.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.960]   You can sell a property and the market is extremely efficient, so you know what the
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.880]   price that you're getting in as and you know what the price that you can get out is.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.240]   And so that allows you to plan.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.800]   You go and you say, "Hey, I bought this property.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's $125,000 and now I can sell it and I can get out of it."
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.720]   And so you know your exit plan.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:31.200]   That is not true in any way, shape, or form in any place in Central America.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:36.360]   If it is true, the only place it would be true would be a place like Panama City with
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:43.640]   downtown apartments in well-established high-rise apartment buildings.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:50.280]   There's nowhere else or Mexico City in very desirable neighborhoods and very established
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.400]   places.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.840]   That's where you could sell a property quickly.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.640]   Everywhere else in Central America, you would expect that if you wanted to sell a property,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.840]   minimum you should plan on a couple of years because there's no efficient marketing of
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.000]   a property.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.560]   There's no central database.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:12.000]   There's no central system and there's not a lot of demand, especially the kinds of properties
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.640]   that you are interested in.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   There's not a lot of local demand for those properties.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.720]   The reason I say there's not a lot of local demand, let me explain to you how Central
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   America works.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.800]   It's very different than the United States.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.440]   In Central America, you have a much greater wealth disparity than you have in the United
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   States.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:39.100]   In the United States, there is a massive middle class where you have many, many people who
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:43.560]   have the means to afford middle class lifestyle.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.320]   The United States has the strongest middle class of any country in the world.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.400]   It's wonderful.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.440]   But in Central America, you don't have that.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.080]   In Central America, you have a very, very small middle class.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.200]   You rather have a small upper class and a very large lower class.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.100]   The upper class is exceedingly wealthy.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:07.280]   You have many, many very, very wealthy people all throughout Central America.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:12.400]   They live like wealthy people, which means they have nice houses, they have nice plantations,
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:19.880]   they have nice apartments, they have nice cars, they have large estates with multiple
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.600]   employees working for them on their estates, etc.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   They're not interested in a beach shack somewhere.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.880]   They're not interested in a tiny house.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.400]   They're not interested in some dinky little apartment.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.160]   They're interested in top level properties that are created for wealthy people and they
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.960]   have the means to afford it.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.880]   On the other hand, you have a huge lower class.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.200]   That lower class is not interested in buying any kind of property that you would actually
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   live in.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Why?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.400]   Because the lower class can build for itself an appropriate home.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.640]   Unlike in the United States where no poor person can build his own home, you can't afford
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   it because you can't afford to comply with code enforcement, you can't afford to do it
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.400]   all at once, you can't afford to get your plans through city hall.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   Poor people in the United States can't build their own houses, but in Central America you
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   can.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.440]   You can go out and you can get some wood from the local rough cut lumber from the local
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.480]   saw mill and you can save up and you can get a few pieces of tin and you can build a shack
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.360]   and you can live in the shack.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.400]   Everywhere that you will go in El Salvador where somebody is building a community, there
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.360]   are plenty of people who are already living there, but they built their house for $2,000,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.200]   $3,000, $1,000, etc.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.840]   So the kind of property that you're looking at is not the kind of property that you will
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.800]   be able to sell very quickly.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:46.080]   So you need to know that going in and be thoughtful and recognize, "Hey, if I buy this property,
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.640]   I'm going to own this property for a very long time and/or I'm going to have to sell
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.880]   it to another foreigner."
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.000]   So now let's talk about the foreign property market.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.600]   So the development that you're looking at is almost certainly, if it has a website and
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:08.360]   if it's something that has crossed your computer screen, that development is almost certainly
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:16.440]   a development that has been created for expats, for foreigners, be it for vacationing foreigners
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.360]   or just expats living in El Salvador, which is great.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.080]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.640]   And in fact, you might find it to be a wonderful community.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.560]   You might really enjoy it.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.960]   There'll be a really fun international flair.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.720]   There's lots of other expats that you would be able to speak with in English.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.440]   You can enjoy your time together.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.480]   It's not bad to live in an expat bubble in El Salvador.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.080]   You might really enjoy it.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.880]   And the kinds of people who would also be interested in a tiny house or a surf shack
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.840]   on the beach might just be your perfect people that you really want to enjoy being with.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   But you are paying a very significant financial premium for that property because you are
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.800]   compensating the developer who had the vision and the foresight and took the financial risks
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.240]   to put the land together to get the appropriate zoning permits, to get it all titled and marked
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.960]   out and surveyed and to go ahead and build the structures, etc.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.640]   And that developer probably has a significant inventory.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.600]   And so let's say that you buy the property and five years from now you want to sell it,
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.520]   the developer is still going to probably have a sales office where he's still building other
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.280]   properties and selling those other properties.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.320]   And so why would somebody come and buy your five-year-old lived-in property and not simply
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.400]   go and buy one of the brand new ones from the developer?
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.760]   There could be good reasons why.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.600]   You might develop the place and it's beautiful.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.400]   You might have really mature fruit trees.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.280]   And for me, if I could go in and buy a five-year-old house, but that five-year-old house is surrounded
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.560]   by a food forest, whereas the brand new one has been, the ground has been raised and it's
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.120]   just denuded earth and I've got to do it all, man, I'll take the five-year-old house with
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.400]   the food forest any day of the week.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.320]   But you need to think about this going in.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.920]   So those should be some big warning flags to say to you that if you go into this type
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:09.380]   of property, you want to make sure that you actually like it and that you like being there
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.840]   and you're going to get good use out of it, that you're going to fly down and spend significant
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.120]   amounts of time there, that your family is going to want to come and be with you there
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.980]   or that you're going to actually use it.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:26.940]   Whereas the property markets in all of Central America are simply wildly different than everything
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.720]   that you are accustomed to in the United States.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.780]   So can buying a property be a great thing?
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.780]   Absolutely.
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.300]   If you buy a property that you love and that you love going to and that you're going to
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.580]   want to continue to go to for many years, then I say go for it.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.980]   If you can afford it, go for it.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.560]   Buy it, make use of it because you'll enjoy it.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.220]   If your family enjoys it, maybe it's got a wonderful surf break and you just love going
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:58.340]   down there, your children love it or your friends love it, go for it.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:04.440]   Is there a good chance that these properties that are purchased today will be worth more
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.100]   a couple decades from now?
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.380]   Almost certainly.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:15.500]   All of the economies in Central America are growing with the exception perhaps of Nicaragua.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.700]   The business climate has improved.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:24.860]   El Salvador just elected a young forward-thinking president.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:30.440]   Many of these countries have made tremendous progress in reducing corruption, increasing
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.620]   business friendliness, etc.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:37.700]   There's every reason to think that there's good potential for growth in the future.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:50.020]   I don't expect Central America to be the war-torn, violent place that it was during the 1980s.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.460]   I don't personally expect that to happen again, again with the big exception of Nicaragua
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.620]   right now.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.780]   But still, that's a long-term perspective.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:04.240]   If you're looking at it from a financial perspective, I think you would find many, many markets
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.780]   that seem much more attractive in terms of their growth potential than most places in
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.060]   Central America.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:21.460]   That would be my caution to say, don't buy a property because it looks good in the pictures.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.780]   First thing you do is go there, spend some time there, find some other Bitcoiners who
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.020]   are also doing that, check out where they're going.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:35.200]   I think there is a good reason to think that El Salvador may indeed have some growth due
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.000]   to the Bitcoin economy.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.440]   There are many people who are overnight Bitcoin millionaires who are going there and seeking
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:50.040]   to encourage them for their forward-thinking stance on making Bitcoin a required currency
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.480]   to be accepted.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:57.600]   But having spent a good amount of time in Central America, I would caution you that
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:03.640]   go and live it, spend several good vacations there before you actually go and pull the
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.040]   trigger on a property.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.920]   One more piece of advice and then I'll await your response.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.360]   Before you go and you buy in a planned community, make sure that that planned community is going
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:27.560]   to offer you something significant that is not available in the open market.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:33.720]   Here is where, since you don't speak fluent Spanish and you are a foreigner, I would strongly
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:39.660]   urge you to find a local person, develop some local contacts.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.400]   Those can begin with simply social contacts.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.680]   You might meet some people who live there, meet some expats, you might meet a missionary
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.340]   or meet someone who retired down there, etc.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.220]   And then you probably want to find some professional contacts, right?
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.800]   Find a local lawyer.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:00.520]   Probably a local lawyer is one of the best information brokers.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.760]   Hire the lawyer to be your representative and to look for some other properties.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:12.480]   Because if you're looking to spend your money well, for $100,000 without question, if you
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:18.520]   could work with an appropriate local, you could get far more land and probably more
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.000]   opportunity for a house than what the developer is offering you.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.340]   And go and see the development with your eyes and say, "Is this a place that I actually
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.340]   want to live in?"
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.480]   Let me give you an example.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.720]   First, all throughout Central America are all kinds of developments where somebody came
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.280]   in and said, "Hey, you know what?
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.200]   I'm going to make a buck developing property and selling it to rich Americans."
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.580]   And they come in and they just never finish the development.
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:45.200]   And you'll find that there's this big elaborate gate and then the road is just destroyed in
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.400]   front and you've got no recourse, right?
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:54.800]   You're left with something that is totally, it's not worthless, but it's pretty much worthless.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   Because you have no recourse.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   There's no legal recourse.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.000]   You won't get anywhere in the courts.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.520]   And if the developer just takes the money and disappears, then everyone who actually
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.040]   bought property in that development is left without recourse.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.000]   And many times, the development doesn't get finished.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.980]   And so you need to be very thoughtful and get good legal advice to make sure that you're
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.800]   getting in at a phase in which it's appropriate.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.020]   There are some developments that are really special.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:24.520]   My favorite development in Central America is Rancho Santana, which is one that Mark
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.000]   Ford was involved in developing in Nicaragua, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.960]   And it is just, it's stunning, right?
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.520]   It's amazing.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:41.280]   But it's amazing because Mark and his co-investors, they sank, it was a passion project for them,
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   right?
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   They sank Rancho Santana, Rancho San Juan, and they decided to develop it.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   And it's luxury.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.520]   And they have committed themselves to maintaining that standard of luxury.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   And it's the kind of standard that there is a big market for because it's a luxury market.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.600]   Another good example would be in Costa Rica, right?
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:01.160]   You've got Los Sueños, the development in Jaco.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.280]   It's a luxury development.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.320]   And it's going to always have that luxury appeal because it's convenient, right?
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   You can fly into Costa Rica.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.360]   In an hour, you can be at your door in Jaco, hour and a half, hour to hour and a half from
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.360]   the airport.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:22.080]   You can, you have the Marriott Hotel there, which is an attraction for many tourists.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.000]   You have the Yacht Club.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.880]   You've got kind of this high-end stuff and it's a luxury development that's very proven.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.600]   And so I think these are the kinds of developments and they're all over Central America.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.800]   You can find them, but they're not at the low end, the low end side.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   They're luxury developments.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.040]   And I think there's a good, if you're looking for a luxury vacation home, there's a good
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   argument for them.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.840]   But I would be nervous myself, especially without having spent significant amount of
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.560]   time there vacationing or without having a personal acquaintance.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:59.320]   There are expats developing all kinds of properties all throughout Central America.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.080]   And they're often labors of love, right?
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.600]   Little eco-villages, little things like that.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.880]   And so if you can find a labor of love where there's somebody who's building something
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.960]   because they're committed to it and they're living there, then yes, go all in.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:16.560]   Just make sure that this one that you're involved in does have that expression.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.560]   That's my overview.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   Awesome.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.560]   Thank you.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:27.280]   I think I was feeling like I needed to get in while prices were kind of still low in
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.040]   the region before things blow up because of Bitcoin.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I think I was kind of spiraling into an impulse buy, perhaps.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.040]   And I think I just need to chill out and I need to go there.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.520]   And I mean, if prices rise in the next few years, so be it.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.640]   I'll just keep on saving.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.160]   You need to go there and you need to make sure.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:53.920]   I do not expect, I think that Bitcoin may have some influence on El Salvador.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:57:01.440]   But El Salvador is starting from a very position significantly at the rear.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.960]   El Salvador is known for having the highest murder rate in Central America.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.240]   I think the fear that people have of that is overblown.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:15.520]   Generally, virtually all of the violence that happens in Mexico, in anywhere in Central
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.840]   America, virtually all of the violence is related to drugs.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:24.240]   Meaning people that are buying drugs, going and literally buying drugs on the beach in
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:29.720]   Mexico and get targeted, or who are involved in the drug trade and the gang wars that are
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.360]   associated with them.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:37.120]   But El Salvador has had its reputation significantly tarnished by that.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:45.720]   And it's one of those things where the reputation of El Salvador is the worst, in my opinion,
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:51.040]   of any country in Central America.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.240]   I don't need to qualify it.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.640]   I would say I think their reputation is the worst.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.400]   And so again, I think oftentimes it's overblown.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:04.200]   But most people who don't have some confidence from traveling in the region are going to
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.100]   be dissuaded from that.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.360]   And so you just want to be recognized that it's starting from a backwards position.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.800]   And it's going to take some time to work those things out.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.320]   So I say, yeah, get in early, but make sure that you go slow.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:25.120]   Because this is the kind of market where there's no clear and obvious wins.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.520]   I think that if you're looking from an investment perspective, there are many other places in
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.280]   the world that are much more exciting from an investment perspective.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:37.000]   The reason you would go to El Salvador would be, hey, I've got some Bitcoin in this wallet
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.240]   on the side here.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.080]   I want to do a direct Bitcoin transaction.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.660]   El Salvador, I can do that in El Salvador.
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.960]   And I like going there.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.440]   I enjoy spending time there.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.280]   We got this little corner where some other Bitcoiners are also setting up shop, where
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.840]   we're all going ahead and establishing our homes together.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.680]   And we like each other.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.520]   Then I think that there's a good reason for you to do it.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.360]   But I wouldn't just jump in out of a fear that you're going to miss out.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.840]   I don't think you're going to miss out.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   All right.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   Three, one, two, four.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   It doesn't matter.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   Five colors left.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   Peter, welcome to the show.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   How can I serve you today?
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:19.640]   I want to talk about European inheritance taxes.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   I'll do my best.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   Let me just say that.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   I don't promise anything.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   I'll do my best.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   I keep trying to stump you.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   I think you may have.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.800]   I could do US inheritance taxes all day long, but I'm not good enough to do European.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.800]   But let's try.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   Go ahead.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.080]   I don't know if the exact specifics are really what I'm looking for.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.920]   I think I'm looking for more for just the general strategies to try to reduce them.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.800]   And obviously, there will be country-specific stuff.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:52.120]   But I've got friends who have family property in France.
[00:59:52.120 --> 01:00:04.040]   And they're trying to figure out whether going through some maneuvers to try to equity strip
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:10.840]   the property with a mortgage on it to reduce the value of the property for the tax basis
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.720]   purpose is worth it versus just going ahead and paying the taxes.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.480]   But I was just sort of curious about just kind of what some of the strategies you can
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.960]   have other than just straight out paying it in terms of trying to potentially reduce the
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   tax.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   Right.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.400]   So, again, we're outside of my area of expertise.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.000]   I want to clarify that up front.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.320]   This is definitely a question where you would want to retain a proper French financial planner
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.600]   who understands the ins and outs of French taxation.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   That's the key.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:57.280]   What I would point out is that there are a couple of options, things that are worth paying
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.400]   attention to.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.880]   Thing number one, it's important to note, especially when we're dealing with the difference
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.640]   between Europe and the United States and especially France, that...
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.360]   And let me just clarify, this is not you that you're working on this problem.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.560]   This is some friends of yours.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.400]   And you're just kind of meditating on their question, wondering if there are any options
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   for theirs.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   Is that right?
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   That's correct.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   Okay.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:29.240]   And these friends, are they born and bred, raised native French or are they expats who
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.120]   have French connections?
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.000]   No, they're French.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.360]   Their parents are French.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.040]   They're actually dual US French citizens, but they are straight up French.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   Okay.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:48.600]   So the dual citizenship thing is actually complex, but let's just give you a quick overview
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.320]   and I won't be able to give you many details.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.400]   Let's give a quick overview.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.440]   Number one, it's important to recognize that the attitude and the practice around taxation
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.960]   and tax paying is exceedingly different between France and the United States.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.800]   In the United States, first of all, the United States has the highest rate of tax compliance
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.880]   of any country in the world.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.720]   Regularly, when the surveys are done of people paying their taxes, people in the United States
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.080]   pay their taxes as they are calculated and owed at a higher rate than any other country
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.080]   in the world.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.560]   Whereas other countries that rank very highly, such as Germany, still the United States comes
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:38.480]   out with a higher payment rate of people actually paying their taxes as they are assessed and
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.900]   as they're owed.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:48.640]   This is often surprising to people because as US Americans, we like to gripe a lot about
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.720]   our taxes.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.000]   We argue about them.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.060]   We gripe about them.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:57.960]   We have lots of loud people who, these loud, crazy libertarians who believe that taxation
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.680]   is theft and they get all grumpy when they think that they should pay any taxes.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:09.320]   But the truth is that there is a deep seated belief in the US American system that you
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.480]   should pay your taxes.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:18.460]   And thus, we have a system that's somewhat straightforward and people comply.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.260]   That is not the same in the French context.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:28.780]   The French context is much more of a matter of a battle, an argument, and there's going
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:35.060]   to be some negotiations involved between the tax authorities and the individual taxpayers.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.700]   You don't just, in the United States, if you get a bill from the IRS and they say, "You
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.500]   owe us X amount of dollars," you pull out your checkbook and you write it.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.320]   It's not the same in the French culture.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.380]   If you get a bill from the tax authorities in France, you start working on it and you
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.420]   think, "Well, okay, how are we going to do it?"
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.780]   Now, I wouldn't presume to go beyond that.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.380]   I know that that much is true and I wouldn't go beyond that in my personal analysis.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:59.740]   But I would say that here's where the local knowledge is so important.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:05.300]   That it's not like in the United States where there's a set of techniques and we can look
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.700]   through the book, et cetera.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.300]   We need to actually go and say, "Who are the local taxing authorities?
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.020]   Who's going to be doing the assessment?
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.840]   What are the opportunities for negotiation?
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.020]   How does the system work?"
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020]   et cetera.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.980]   So that would be the first thing.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:23.660]   Second thing is that unlike the United States, which has global taxation, the tax bill that
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:34.280]   a French citizen can legally owe is based upon the behavior of that French citizen.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:42.540]   So as a US American, if you've got $150 million, you're going to have to go through the relevant
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.460]   calculations for your inheritance taxes.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:52.540]   The actual taxes themselves are somewhat optional.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:59.940]   There is an abundant repertoire of techniques that can be applied to the reduction of those
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.820]   tax rates.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:08.780]   But the whole estate itself is going to be taxed under the US system.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:15.000]   And this is where, for your French friends, they're going to have, if their wealth rises
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.900]   to the level of where they're going to owe inheritance taxes, estate taxes, then they
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.180]   will have to deal with the US system itself separate from the French system.
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:36.100]   However, a French citizen always has the ability to move his affairs outside of France.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.580]   And so this is where, to some degree, some form of equity stripping or looking at the
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.700]   estate and figuring out where are the assets and what the assets are, and could we move
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.980]   some of those assets to a tax haven, that can be a very effective strategy.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.500]   It is not an effective strategy for US citizens.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.700]   Because you could take, let's say you've got $150 million in the US, and you say, "Oh,
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.900]   I'm just going to move my $150 million from the US, I'm going to move myself outside of
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.900]   the United States.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.220]   I'm going to go down to my little beachfront resort in El Salvador that I bought with my
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.440]   Bitcoin, and I'm going to move my $150 million just simply outside the United States and
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.980]   put it in a tax haven."
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.140]   That's not going to save you anything from an estate tax perspective.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.700]   You can do some sophisticated planning, and you can start to move some of the money, some
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:25.980]   of the assets into irrevocable trusts, and you can freeze the assets.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:30.860]   You can bring it together under your gift tax exemptions, your estate tax exemptions.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.780]   There are techniques that you can do, but the whole offshore thing is not such a direct
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.780]   scenario.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.500]   However, for a French citizen, those things are possible.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   The same French citizen could move to El Salvador or to some other place that's more tax-friendly,
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:53.500]   could keep his property in France, but could escape over time the French taxation system,
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:00.940]   even up to and including not owing inheritance taxes on the bulk of his estate.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:05.340]   Real estate is always going to be taxed by a local government, because that's what a
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.300]   government has control of.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.500]   A government can control your real estate because they, using their martial power, they
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.460]   control a set of land.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.860]   That's our current definition of what a nation state is.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:25.900]   It's a military force that controls, by use of force, a specific area of land.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:32.080]   Because of that, the tax authorities, the tax agents of that government have massive
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.660]   power to control your affairs over the land.
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.940]   They own the land.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.460]   They don't own everything else.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.980]   They can't keep your business from moving.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:41.940]   They can't keep your intellectual property from moving.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:46.280]   They can't keep yourself from moving, but they can control your land.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:52.100]   There is potentially a whole world of techniques that are available to your friends that are
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:57.040]   not available to US citizens, where your friends can move themselves to a tax haven.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.740]   They can keep their property in France.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.260]   They may move some of the equity out of that property.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:06.620]   They may have some negotiations with the local taxing authorities.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.220]   They may move the property into trust in some way.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.460]   I can't articulate the specific techniques beyond what I've done, but they do have a
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.900]   lot of options.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.540]   What they definitely would want to do is they would want to consult a proper professional
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.140]   who is familiar with French law and custom and who could work in that area.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.220]   I guarantee those planners are out there.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:33.020]   Then do a personalized assessment to figure out what needs to be done with their affairs.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.980]   >>Steve: All right, good show.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:37.980]   Thank you.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   >>Trevor: My pleasure.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:42.620]   It's a fun question though.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:50.340]   I have spent a lot of money on tax planning materials for Europeans.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.620]   So I have a lot of the data.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:53.940]   I've gone through a good bit of it.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:57.860]   I just can't summon it to mind quickly enough to answer it specifically.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.420]   Lucas, welcome to the show.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   How can I serve you today?
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.420]   >>Lucas: Hey.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.380]   How's it going, Joshua?
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.380]   Having a good day?
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.380]   Excellent.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.580]   So interested in the subject of what I'm going to call baby prep hacking.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:17.380]   So I've been listening extensively to your series of podcasts about what to do with young
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:22.540]   children and homeschooling and babies and diapers and everything and sharing it with
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.540]   my wife.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.460]   We're starting to talk about, okay, what can you do?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.220]   What strategically can you put in place financially ahead of or shortly after the birth of your
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   child?
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.540]   Things like 529 plans or whole life insurance policies for children.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.980]   I was wondering, is there anything new, anything that you haven't talked about yet that are
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.260]   just kind of little niche fund strategies for giving yourself a financial advantage
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.100]   by having a baby or giving them a financial advantage?
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.780]   >>Trevor: Absolutely.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:56.180]   I encourage, so to be clear, are you currently expecting a baby or is this hypothetical at
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.180]   this point?
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:00.980]   >>Lucas: This is hypothetical at this point, but I don't think it will be too far off.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.300]   >>Trevor: Okay, great.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:08.940]   So I do like to always insert here the topic of birth tourism.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:15.300]   I think one of the biggest opportunities that you can give your child at the time of birth
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:25.360]   is access, and I mean this financially speaking, is access to a country or a region or a set
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.140]   of resources.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:34.340]   There is a reason why there is a thriving birth tourism industry in the United States,
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:40.540]   in Canada, etc., because for people who are not from these countries, they can achieve
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:48.020]   for their children a whole new set of opportunities, a whole new set of advantages by virtue of
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:53.340]   their child being born a citizen of that particular nation.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:59.460]   So Americans don't think a lot about this because we tend to not look outside of our
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.820]   borders for opportunities.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:05.180]   We know that we live in the land of opportunity, and so we're not accustomed to thinking I
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:08.300]   should go and look somewhere else for opportunity.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.300]   But this is something that is well worth considering.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.340]   And so let me give you an example.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.140]   You could, I'm assuming you sound American, are you living in the United States and you
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.620]   and your wife are both Americans?
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.620]   >>Lucas: Yeah.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.620]   >>Trevor: Okay.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.980]   So right now you could go, and let's say you were having a child, you could go and you
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.540]   could have the child in Canada.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:31.700]   And if you had your child born in Canada, your child would be from birth a Canadian
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.700]   citizen.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.060]   You can go to Canada, you can rent a nice house or find a nice hospital or birth center,
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.820]   whatever you wind up doing when it comes time to dealing with the medical details of the
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:49.980]   birth, and your child will be a Canadian citizen by virtue of being born on the soil of Canada,
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:56.140]   which is a just solely country that offers citizenship to anybody born on its soil.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:01.180]   That won't do anything for you or for your wife, but what it would do for your child
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:08.300]   would be, number one, give your child the right to be a Canadian citizen, which means
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.620]   your child would always have the right to live in Canada.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.840]   Your child has the right to work in Canada.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.660]   Your child would have the right to be educated without cost to your child in Canada at every
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.400]   level of education.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.680]   Your child would have the right to the Canadian government healthcare system by virtue of
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.520]   being a Canadian citizen.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:36.640]   And so those four things right there from a financial perspective could be very significant
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.120]   for your child's future.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.660]   You could put money in a 529 account and save money for your child's education, or you could
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.600]   just simply have your child be a Canadian citizen and have the plan be that your child
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:56.040]   goes to Canada and simply goes to college in Canada, which is much more progressive
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:02.800]   than the United States with regard to college funding, government healthcare programs, etc.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800]   This is, I think, a wonderful backup plan.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   And so it's a significantly difficult thing to do, and I think that very few first-time
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.400]   parents are going to be motivated enough to do it.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   It's difficult.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.040]   It's difficult for a first-time mother on top of all of the complications of having
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.480]   a baby, the fears, the learning style, etc.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.040]   It's difficult to imagine going to another country, but that is an opportunity.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.600]   So if you're looking for kind of benefits, government benefits, then that's a very, very
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.720]   simple thing to do.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.880]   And totally legal, you can do it.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.120]   No problem at all.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.800]   You could also look at this in terms of where is an opportunity zone, right?
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.120]   Where is there an opportunity for significant financial growth?
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.880]   Where would I want my child to be able to go and work and live, and where would there
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.220]   be investment options, etc.?
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.320]   So you could say, where are the places in the world where there's the highest rates
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.200]   of growth?
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:09.120]   Now this is hard for birth tourism because most countries don't offer birthright citizenship,
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   but there are some that do.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.100]   So an example would be South America, right?
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:20.240]   If you had a child born in Brazil, as quite commonly talked about, then your child would
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.920]   have the legal right to live and work virtually in all of South America as part of MERCOSUR,
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.200]   which is an alliance of South American nations working together.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.680]   If you look forward over the next several decades, it's hard for me personally to believe
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.280]   that Brazil, a nation of a couple hundred million people, plus Argentina, plus Chile,
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.600]   plus Colombia, plus Venezuela, when it comes out of its nightmare, all these countries,
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.760]   it's hard for me to believe that there's not more opportunities for a faster growth prospect
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:59.120]   than there is in, say, the United States, which is a more mature and advanced economy.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.200]   So that would be another way of looking at it.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.040]   I won't go on more about birth tourism other than to say that you can look at the world
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.800]   and there are options that you can achieve.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.960]   Let's say that you had an interest in Europe, right?
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.040]   Many people have an affinity and an attraction to Europe.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   Europe is hard.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.560]   It's hard to have a European citizen, but since you're not currently expecting a baby,
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.240]   it could be possible for you to establish a residency, a legal residency for you and
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.160]   your wife in Europe, and then have your child born in Europe.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.080]   And then your child, Portugal would be a good country to look at there, and see if you could
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.760]   arrange for your child to be a Portuguese citizen from birth by virtue of you and your
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.000]   wife having Portuguese residence permits.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.040]   That could be something worth considering.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040]   Now moving past-
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.600]   Yeah, I love the idea.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:57.000]   I tend to think that she would be somewhat hesitant with a first child to do that, just
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.520]   wanting some of the comforts and closeness of home and being around family for it.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.320]   But the idea is awesome, and I'm definitely attracted to it.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:14.620]   I think that virtually almost no US American first mother, first time mother would ever
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.720]   do birth tourism.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.460]   And it's hard for me to imagine her saying yes.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.480]   My wife and I did it with our third child, and what I would say is-
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.320]   Sorry, our fourth child, and what I would say is that it's doable.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.000]   We've done it.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.520]   Having done it, it's much harder than most people think, and most people are not going
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.280]   to actually do it for all the reasons that you stated.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.520]   But I can't myself help but appreciate the elegance of it as a solution.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.360]   And there are, and I say that for my international audience, that there is a big difference between
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:57.040]   you and your wife's situation versus our Afghani friends who are listening, or our Pakistani
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.880]   friends who are listening, or our Iraqi friends, or our Haitian friends who are listening.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:10.560]   Because all of a sudden, you and I, you have no concept of how difficult it is to live
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.840]   in the world as a citizen of Afghanistan only.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:23.120]   And so if there is a kind of a middle class or upper middle class Afghani couple who is
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.080]   thinking about having a baby, the very best, most important thing that they could do with
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.160]   their money, if they could in any way work it out, is to fix their paperwork problems.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.380]   And I'm using these words very carefully.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:45.220]   There are paperwork problems that Afghanis and Pakistanis and Iraqis face.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:51.200]   And so it's a big deal, and it would without question be the best $20,000, $30,000, $40,000
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:58.300]   spent for those people, for that they could invest into their children in order to solve
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.620]   their children's paperwork problems.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.220]   It's a big, big deal.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:05.720]   Now let's go back to your situation personally.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.900]   When you have a new child, I would say the first thing is I always buy a whole life insurance
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.860]   policy for all of my children.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:17.020]   I don't buy generally big ones, but if your financial situation allows you to, I think
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.020]   it's appropriate.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:22.060]   I always buy at least a small one.
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.220]   And these are always whole life policies.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.940]   And then what I do is I make sure that those policies have two things that are very important
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.940]   to me.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.760]   So number one, I buy a small whole life policy, and I make sure that it has an additional
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:42.260]   purchase benefit on it that allows the, where the policy has a guaranteed right to purchase
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:47.040]   more life insurance in the future at a certain age.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.880]   And so generally, I think with the policies I own for my children, starting at the age
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:19:00.580]   of 20, then I as the policy owner can purchase additional life insurance for them every three
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   years.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:07.340]   And I usually start with either $25,000 or $50,000 policies, and I can put an additional
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:12.220]   purchase benefit on the policy of $50,000 or $100,000 or $150,000.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:17.500]   What that means is, let's say I start with a $50,000 policy, and I have usually, I think
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:22.420]   it's seven opportunities between 20 and 40 to add $150,000.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:28.380]   I can buy a $50,000 whole life policy when my child is 10 days old.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.020]   And I can't remember, I think the child does have to be at least five days old, seven days
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.780]   old, 10 days old, something like that.
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:40.340]   But I can buy a policy within the first month of my child's life when the child has no medical
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.700]   underwriting, no anything.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:47.060]   My children aren't scuba diving, they're not learning to fly airplanes, they're not doing
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.340]   anything dangerous at zero years old.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.720]   And then with that additional purchase benefit, I can increase it in the future without any
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.580]   medical underwriting.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:00.700]   I can increase it without any hobby or avocation underwriting.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.740]   There's no lifestyle questions.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.660]   And so I have those options to increase it in the future for them.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.020]   Now most of the time, this is unnecessary, right?
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.580]   Most of the time you're not going to need it.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:17.020]   You're just going to keep the policy and maybe you just gift it to your child when your child
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:20.180]   is 40, something like that.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.620]   But if you need it, right?
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:28.180]   If you have a child that takes up a major interest in racing cars, if you have a child
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:34.300]   who takes up an interest in becoming an underwater welder or to get a pilot's license, or you
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:42.900]   have a child that faces medical problems, heart defect, leukemia, is a drug addict,
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:48.260]   very depressed, suicidal, like these are the kinds of things that can make a big, big difference
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   for you.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:54.340]   The fact that you can buy life insurance for your children in the future is a very nice
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.340]   thing.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:21:00.100]   You've got to be careful because these policies are not term insurance policies.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:07.620]   And so to add on $150,000, you're buying $150,000 whole life policy for your children at every
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:08.620]   time.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.180]   But to know that I could turn my $50,000 policy into an excess of a million dollar policy
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.580]   for each of my children, I really appreciate that.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.140]   And I think that's useful.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:21.180]   These policies are terrible for cash accumulation.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.660]   The cost of the additional purchase benefit, and I also put a waiver of premium benefit
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:29.340]   on there, where if the child is ever disabled, then the premiums get waived on the policy.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:35.060]   But on all my children's ones, there's a clause where I can still exercise the additional
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.660]   purchase benefit and the premiums are included.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.380]   The cost of those benefits, while very modest on a monthly basis, I'm not sure, I don't
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.620]   even remember how much these policies cost.
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:49.500]   I think they're like $30 a month, $50 a month, something like that, I can't remember.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.980]   But it's very modest on a monthly basis.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:59.340]   But most of the cost goes straight to insurance and to these additional purchase benefits,
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.340]   et cetera.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:04.020]   And so the cash value in the policy is quite anemic.
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.020]   It is there.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:09.220]   They do grow and they do build cash value, but they're not great investments.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.980]   That's the first thing.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.060]   The next thing, 529 accounts, can a 529 account be a good idea?
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.060]   Sure.
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.660]   If it's important to you to have money set aside for college funding, then the best time
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.660]   to do that is when your child is one day old.
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:34.980]   And the best way to do it is to make massive transfers into your child's 529 account up
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.020]   front.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:40.900]   And so if you're wealthy enough to do it, you can put up to five years of your annual
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.740]   exclusion gifting amount into a 529 account on day one.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:49.820]   And then you can do that for a husband, you can do that for a wife, your parents can do
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.860]   it, your grandparents can do it, et cetera.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:57.140]   And so you can put in excess of six figures easily into a 529 account.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:03.100]   And the benefit of this is this immediately puts money aside that can grow for your children's
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.340]   college.
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:09.700]   If it doesn't get used for college, you can get the money out either with a couple of
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:13.020]   the escape options that we've talked about in the past.
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:19.900]   More importantly, this is one of the very few assets that moves money out of your estate
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.700]   but allows you to control the asset still.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.460]   So generally, just like we're talking about estate planning under US estate law, if you
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.540]   move an asset out of your estate, it has to go into an irrevocable trust that you get
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.920]   no interest in, you get no control of, et cetera.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.660]   But a 529 account allows you to move the money into the 529 account and you can still get
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.660]   still control it.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.500]   You can change the beneficiary, you control the money, but it's out of your estate.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:51.380]   It's also frequently an asset that's protected from the claims of creditors in many states.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:55.600]   It's also an asset that can be frequently protected in bankruptcy.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.940]   And so it's a very useful way that you could set aside a lot of money for your child's
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:06.060]   future for his or her education and yet do it in a good way.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.680]   And then when you put a lot of money into those accounts up front and you have a long
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.160]   time for them to grow with good investments, that's where from a tax perspective they really
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.740]   do work out very well.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.780]   I'll pause for a moment.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.500]   Any questions, comments, anything so far?
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.260]   No, that's all great so far.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:29.060]   Definitely a little better clarification than I had on the 529 and really how to maximize
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.540]   value there by making a large upfront payment.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:40.060]   We've done some of the more niche stuff, just the kind of people we are.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.540]   I think we probably see eye to eye on several things.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:49.500]   We already bought used cloth diapers in bulk from a friend who was selling them.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:53.780]   Anything else like that that you haven't mentioned on the podcast before?
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:58.100]   I think my wife would be willing to listen to an entire podcast of your wife talking
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.020]   about ways to save money on babies.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:01.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:09.340]   So used cloth diapers are wonderful because, so first of all, people who aren't familiar
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:14.780]   with cloth diapering, they're like, "I don't do cloth diapering."
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.080]   What's funny is that we've used cloth diapers with all of our children, but we use disposable
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:24.660]   diapers when we travel because we don't have the facility to wash the diapers.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:27.100]   And it's not such a big deal to me.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.620]   My wife can't stand disposable diapers because they always blow out.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:35.140]   They don't hold the things that they're supposed to hold, whereas cloth diapers, properly done,
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.900]   don't ever blow out.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.740]   And if you buy them early and if you get them in bulk, if you get them used from a friend,
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:48.140]   etc., then they're fantastic because they're super expensive to buy.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:51.020]   Especially if you go and buy them new, they're really expensive to buy.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.020]   And so that's a good purchase.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.740]   That's a good area where doing a bulk buy on the secondhand market is really, really
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:57.740]   good.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:00.820]   The other thing that you just want to be careful of is it takes a little time to figure out
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.060]   what you like.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:08.860]   So an example, with our first baby, we thought, I forget the brands now, but we thought we
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:13.460]   really liked this brand that you put the...
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.060]   It was a fancy brand.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.020]   I've forgotten all the brand names.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:22.500]   But then, it's funny, a midwife said, "Just covers and inserts, covers and inserts."
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:26.940]   And this brand, I think it may have been Fuzzy Buns or something, where you have to insert
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.660]   the insert into the actual diaper.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:33.340]   It becomes super annoying over time because you always are doing this extra work.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.820]   And so we've switched over the years.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.740]   My wife really likes the Buttons brand.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:42.580]   That's her favorite, which is just a cover with inserts, but she likes the Buttons brand.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:47.220]   So that's what she would say if she were giving her cloth diaper spiel.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:52.540]   But it's really great and it's definitely the way to go.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.540]   It's better.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.020]   I hate throwing away diapers.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.860]   I hate creating all that garbage.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:01.340]   Putting all the plastic into a landfill drives me nuts for something that can be so easily
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.340]   solved.
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.720]   You'll also want to think ahead about your washing machine.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.540]   If you're going to do cloth diapers, you want to have, if possible, you don't want to have
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.540]   a high efficiency washing machine.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:14.900]   You want to have an upright washing machine with a center agitator.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.980]   So that's your best one.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:20.780]   You also want to be careful on the soap that you use and make sure that you have an appropriate
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.780]   soap.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:26.420]   The big thing you can do is you can stockpile clothing pretty easily.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:33.260]   So what my wife did when we had children was whenever people said, "Hey, do you want baby
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.260]   clothes?"
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.260]   She would say, "Yes."
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:40.980]   And so most people have one or two children and then they're looking to, they don't want
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.820]   to have any more children and they need to free up their space and they need to get rid
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.260]   of the baby clothes.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:50.420]   And most people that have one or two children who are upwardly mobile, et cetera, they have
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:53.820]   lots of nice clothes and the clothes barely ever get worn.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.260]   And so we just practiced saying, "Yes."
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.260]   Anytime someone says, "Oh, do you want this certain thing?"
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.260]   "Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.260]   We'll take it."
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:01.260]   And the clothes are the most valuable.
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:05.240]   And what she would do is she would go through, organize them, sort them, take the ones that
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.660]   she liked, make her outfits, et cetera, and then just line them up according to size.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:13.380]   She would clean them, get some of the spots off, et cetera.
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.740]   But I set her up these shelves.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:21.860]   I got some of just those standard shelving units at a home improvement store and I set
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:24.180]   her up with these Tupperware bins.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:29.860]   And for the first, she had I think 12 Tupperware bins of free clothes that she got or had them
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:33.420]   all organized according to size, all organized in advance.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:41.160]   And basically for the first years of our three children life, she bought like three outfits
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:44.120]   and it was three outfits because she just thought they were really cute and she'd never
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.820]   bought any of our children outfits.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.020]   And so I was like, "Buy them.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.700]   Come on, spend some money."
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.620]   And so the clothes are a great way.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:57.240]   And it's really a relief also for the parents who are just a little bit ahead of you.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:01.780]   They have a child that's a few years older because now once they have a repository for
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.540]   their used clothing, then that solves their problem.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.540]   They feel good.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.540]   They give it to you.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.540]   You take it.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.780]   You pass along what you don't like.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.780]   You use it.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:11.620]   And then when you're done, you pass it along to others, et cetera.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:14.200]   So the clothing is the big one.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.420]   Beyond that, with children, there's really not a lot of costs.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.220]   Children don't cost much.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:27.900]   If you wipe out your diaper cost, depending on whether you're able to successfully breastfeed
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.100]   or not, buying formula can be a cost.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.300]   But if you take that out, there are very few costs for babies.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:39.960]   And so my biggest encouragement is invest into your child as much as possible.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:46.740]   And so the big investments that I think pay off in spades is, if at all possible, make
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.300]   sure that your child can have a full-time mother, most importantly, at least for the
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.900]   first three to five years of his or her life.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:00.540]   And I say organize your finances in such a way that that is doable and affordable for
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.220]   your family.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:08.420]   If you can make sure that your child has a full-time mother for at least those establishing
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:14.420]   years, that can make such a difference for the rest of your child's life.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.660]   And the data on that is very, very clear.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:20.700]   If you can avoid institutionalizing your children when they're very young, then that can pay
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.380]   off in spades.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.900]   And then you can work on their intelligence.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:27.780]   And mom can have all times.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:32.060]   There are several good books on how to improve your baby's intelligence.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.300]   Some of that is innate, of course, genetic.
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.060]   But there are a lot of things that you can do of stimulating your baby in different ways.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:43.460]   It's as simple as reading to your children, making sure your children get sunshine, and
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.820]   all the stuff.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:48.460]   But I think that your best investments are not financial in that case.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:52.540]   Just a matter of how can I invest into my children to make sure that my children have
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:53.980]   maximum opportunities.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:57.440]   You can deal with some of the stuff that I've talked about with multiple languages.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.020]   You can bring in tutors or nannies to help support you in that.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.820]   You can look at early child education.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:08.060]   I think that it's interesting to look at, but some of it can be overwhelming.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:14.060]   A lot of it can just be simplified down to take time and spend time with your baby.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:19.500]   But yet those things can pay off in spades and largely obviate the need for all of the
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.660]   financial stuff.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:26.980]   To me, it's obvious that if you're thoughtful about what you do in the first few years of
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:34.540]   life and you make sure that your children have a good, solid emotional grounding where
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:45.340]   they're not traumatized in some way, and you work hard at those early years of education,
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:52.020]   early years of vocabulary, early years of school, homeschooling is great for many families,
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.980]   then you basically eliminate all of the things that are going to cost you money down the
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.100]   way.
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:01.300]   People will throw money at your children for college.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:05.580]   People will throw opportunities at them, and all the stuff kind of takes care of itself.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:11.860]   And so the least efficient way to handle those things is through all of the financial stuff.
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.100]   That's an industry that has been developed that allows we financial advisors to sell
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.460]   stuff.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:23.380]   But it's much more efficient for you if you handle it in the old way, and then the whole
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:27.980]   system again will throw money at your children for the rest of their life if you get those
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.720]   early years as best as you can.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.780]   So there's my little spiel.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.580]   Yeah, really, really compelling stuff.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:42.220]   I think summarized, I think you said in the last Q&A call, it's quantity of time at work
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:46.780]   and quality of time—I'm sorry, the reverse—quality of time at work and quantity of time at home.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:50.660]   So that'll be my guiding star when that time comes.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:51.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:55.740]   So think about it in terms of not having payments, not having big bills.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.140]   If you can pay off a house, great.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.960]   Or if you can't pay off a house, don't have a car payment.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.860]   Think about it in terms of, well, maybe you and your wife both have to work.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.960]   You both need jobs, but is grandma available?
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.900]   Could we go ahead and move into a bigger house where grandma could be in the house?
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.700]   So something like that.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:19.060]   Just think about it in terms of the infrastructure of your life because it pays off.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.480]   I'm convinced it pays off big time.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.580]   So keep me in the loop and then, hey, call back in the future and we'll see what happens.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.660]   All right, I had several callers drop off, but here we go.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:29.660]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.660]   How can I serve you today?
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   Last caller.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.660]   Is it just me?
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:33.660]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:34.660]   Tell me your name, please.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.660]   Okay.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.660]   Frank.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.660]   Frank, welcome to the show.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   Hi.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.660]   Thank you.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:48.260]   So I have a main question and then a quicker second question if we have time, but I'll
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.500]   start with the first question.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.060]   So I'm 25 years old.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:58.540]   I have a career as an IT specialist with a government defense contractor, and I'm considering
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:03.580]   joining the reserves or the Air National Guard on a part-time basis.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:08.980]   And I was wondering what your thoughts were on whether you think the benefits of part-time
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.780]   military service outweigh the downsides.
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:19.380]   Thinking about it, like in my mind, the pros would be the potential to gain more experience
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:25.540]   and different kinds of opportunities in my field, the education and healthcare benefits,
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:31.180]   eligibility for VA home loans, eligibility to use commissaries and future retirement
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   benefits.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:39.540]   But some of my concerns are the increasingly authoritarian kinds of rules being imposed
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:47.740]   on military members and federal employees, like the vaccine mandates, as well as just
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:53.300]   more limits on my freedom and free time, especially if I were to have a family in the next five
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.940]   years.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:35:00.580]   Adding another layer of bureaucracy to my life, like another person telling me where
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:06.540]   I have to be and when I have to work or train, as well as it being more difficult to transfer
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:13.180]   or move to a different state or part of the country if another opportunity came up, like
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:18.260]   with my civilian contractor job.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:25.100]   I will answer your question, and I will be as clear as I can.
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:29.260]   This will be an extremely offensive answer to some of my listeners, and I don't enjoy
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.740]   offending people.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:37.620]   I especially don't enjoy offending people who have dedicated their lives to public service,
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:43.060]   service to country, etc. because generally those are the kinds of people that I like.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:49.580]   But I believe in being honest, and so I'll give you my honest opinion, as if you were
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:52.220]   my younger brother.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:57.700]   I come from a family of people who served in the military.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:00.780]   My grandfather was in the army in World War II.
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.540]   He was on the beaches of Normandy two days after D-Day.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:07.340]   It was D-Day plus two, something like that.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:20.060]   My father was a lieutenant commander in the Navy and served in a submarine for many years.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:25.340]   So I come from a family of people who were in the military.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:31.580]   My father was in the reserves for many years, even after he left active service.
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:42.660]   I cannot understand today why any intelligent, capable man or woman would ever join the U.S.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:44.100]   military.
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:49.860]   I cannot see an argument in which it makes any kind of sense.
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:37:00.940]   The things that we honor, the arguments that we most honor are usually protecting freedom
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:05.220]   or standing up a sense of patriotism, a love of country, etc.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:06.460]   Those are things that we rightly honor.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.900]   I believe that we should honor patriotism.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:13.660]   We should honor people who want to defend their neighbors, etc.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:24.820]   But for people who have the most noble of ambitions to serve and to protect, etc., I
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:32.260]   do not see how those noble ambitions can be achieved by serving in the U.S. military in
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:36.780]   any capacity, especially even including the reserves.
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:43.580]   The entire framework of the modern military system is utterly corrupt.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.500]   You cannot be honest and succeed in that system.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:55.980]   The only way that you succeed in the military system is by being dishonest.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.940]   I think the writer, who I would encourage you to read what he has written, who is the
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.580]   best at articulating that from experience.
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:04.580]   I have no experience.
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:10.380]   I've never served in the military, and I was strongly discouraged by my father from ever
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.660]   even considering serving in the military.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:18.460]   I grew up reading books, reading Tom Clancy books and other thrillers that imbued me with
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.900]   this sense of patriotism.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.140]   I wanted to go in the military.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.980]   My brothers wanted to go in the military.
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:28.540]   My father refused to the extent possible.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:30.140]   Of course, we were legally adults.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.540]   We could have disobeyed him and gone.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:38.420]   But he strongly discouraged and sought very, very vigorously to dissuade us from going
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:39.780]   into the military.
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:46.420]   I am today exceedingly grateful that he did, because I would have joined some form of the
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:52.300]   military, some branch of the military out of a desire to have a sense of adventure,
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.700]   out of a desire to have that sense of camaraderie, kind of that being with the boys, doing something
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.540]   that matters and protecting freedom, etc.
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:08.940]   I could have literally lost my life for no good reason at all.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.660]   I could have had my entire life disrupted.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.580]   I'm grateful that I listened to him and his discouragement of going in the military and
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.820]   didn't join myself.
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:21.740]   Back to my point, I don't see...
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.740]   Go and read.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.860]   First of all, read what John T. Reid writes on the subject.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:31.500]   John is known mostly in financial circles for being a real estate pundit, but he went
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.460]   to West Point and he spent a good number of years in the military academy.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:43.420]   One of the things that I appreciate about him is he writes honestly on military issues.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:53.500]   For example, I find his article that he wrote years ago on military draft to be exceedingly
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.940]   persuasive as to why he believes that all military members should be drafted, that having
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.900]   an all-drafty army is actually one of the best ways that you could get a potentially
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:07.320]   moral and upright army of anything else.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:13.180]   So I don't support a draft, but I find his arguments very, very persuasive.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:16.300]   Read some of his arguments about joining the military from the perspective of someone who
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:20.060]   has been inside the military.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:25.500]   From my perspective, I would say that virtually everything that you want to get out of the
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:30.780]   military you can get better in another circumstance.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.760]   So when I get a college education.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.640]   The fact that you have paid me money to go and be on this Q&A call today tells me that
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:44.220]   you're smarter than the person who needs the military for a college degree.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:49.560]   The training that you need, the specialization, even a sense of adventure, all of those things
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.500]   can be accomplished better and more effectively than in the military.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:00.700]   The problem is if you join the military, you will face a significant series of ethical
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:08.460]   conflicts combined with a set of very difficult personal conflicts in your own life.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.180]   Let's begin with the ethical conflicts.
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:17.380]   The US government and the vast majority of military actions that the US government engages
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:23.340]   in are immoral because they are not involved in defensive warfare.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:28.100]   I personally, this is kind of a joke that in today's world, I oppose a standing army.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   The United States should not have a standing army.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:36.620]   There should not be an army that has military bases in a hundred and probably thirty or
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.620]   a hundred and fifty countries in the world.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.740]   It is an insane policy.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:45.940]   All of those bases should be sold and all of the troops should be returned back home.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:47.980]   There should be no standing army.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:51.940]   Or if there is a standing army, it should be a very, very small standing army.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.060]   But that is not the path that we have taken as a nation.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:00.580]   So if you get involved with the US military, you're not involved in serving and protecting.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:09.500]   You're involved in being in promoting military power around the world for the protection
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:14.180]   and the advancement of military, of American business interests.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:17.380]   That's why the American military exists.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.900]   It's my dad who taught me that.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:29.060]   He was in Vietnam in a submarine spying through the periscope on Russia and other places.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:34.780]   And his commander told him, "Dave, listen, you need to understand the US military exists
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:39.100]   for one reason and that is to protect American economic interests.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:44.860]   And so when you sign up for that, you are going into a moral conflict and you're putting
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:51.260]   yourself in a situation in which you will be court-martialed if you follow your conscience.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:55.900]   And most of the time, people that come out of the military, they have to work very hard
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:59.420]   to justify to themselves many of their actions.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.860]   But go and look in your lifetime.
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:07.020]   At 25 years, you were born in 1997, I guess.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:13.860]   So you go back and in my lifetime, the US military has been involved in undeclared war
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:17.060]   after undeclared war after undeclared war.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.660]   And every single one of them has been a failure.
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:25.700]   The US military has not won a war since World War II.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:28.740]   They've not won a war since World War II.
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:37.220]   There was one spectacular victory in Desert Storm, which then of course resulted in Enduring
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:44.060]   Freedom Operation to depose Saddam Hussein and then the quagmire that was Iraq.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:51.300]   And if you go and you look at the death toll of even just these recent conflicts, the war
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:57.140]   in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and the military actions in Pakistan have cost the lives of
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:01.980]   perhaps somewhere between 2 and 4 million people.
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:02.980]   For what?
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.340]   For what moral purpose?
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:10.260]   So you have to recognize that when you're joining an organization that exists to kill
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:16.060]   people, that you are going to be in a situation in which you are going to be asked to kill
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.620]   people.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.420]   And that is something that should not be taken lightly.
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:26.940]   That's something that if you kill someone, whether you kill someone straightforward at
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:32.320]   the muzzle of your gun, or if you kill someone by you're sitting in a trailer and driving
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:37.620]   a drone and dropping a bomb on someone, or whether you just simply do it in a supporting
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:44.940]   role cooking for your mates on the ship, you are involved in an organization that exists
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:46.900]   to kill people.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:52.460]   And virtually all of that killing in the modern context is absolutely immoral.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:45:00.700]   The only, only circumstance in which taking another man's life is morally justified is
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.660]   in the direct defense of human life.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:07.980]   That is the only context in which it is morally justified.
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:12.700]   And so you can create these elaborate theories that somehow the United States of America
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:19.020]   is safer because we have military bases in a hundred and whatever fifty countries around
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:24.180]   the world, and we have all this stuff, and somehow that's a defensive warfare and we're
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:28.380]   going to go into Afghanistan and we're going to get those nasty terrorists before they
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:30.300]   get us and somehow that's moral.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.300]   I don't buy it.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.380]   I don't buy it a bit.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:41.340]   And so I think that you run the risk of putting yourself into a moral conundrum.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:47.540]   And it's very difficult, again I gave my trigger warning up front, that this is very difficult
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:52.140]   for most people because once you get into it, if you enlist, you are going to quickly
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:59.820]   start to talk yourself into the moral appropriateness of your actions.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.620]   Because you'll see information and you will be conditioned into believing that what you
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:05.580]   do is morally right.
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:13.620]   The reason why militaries all around the world enlist you at seventeen and eighteen and nineteen
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:18.700]   and twenty and frankly twenty-five years old is because you are gullible.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.580]   You are gullible at twenty-five years old.
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.040]   You're gullible at twenty years old.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.040]   We all are.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.300]   I was.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:33.140]   I remember vividly my driving in my car, listening to right-wing talk radio talk about
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.060]   "we've got to go ahead and we've got to go in and get those people who attacked us on
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:41.360]   9/11 and we've got to go in and it's Operation, I forget, it was Enduring Freedom."
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.380]   And I was so gullible that I was just enthusiastic about it.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:49.940]   Well now in my mid-thirties I'm less gullible than I was.
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:54.860]   And so if you talk to young men, young men think that war is exciting.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.620]   Old men know that war is absolute hell.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:03.820]   And the only time at which you voluntarily walk into hell is when the people are literally
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:09.660]   at your door and they're going to kill your children and rape your wife and steal your
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.660]   goods.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:15.540]   In that sense, yes, you walk into hell and you defend your home.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:19.420]   But you don't do it voluntarily for any beyond that.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:25.620]   So it's almost, I would say impossible, although I haven't been in the military and I've known
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.900]   a number of friends, people that I admired.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:31.380]   I've had clients, I've had people I've served on boards, I've had good friends who've served
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.380]   in the military.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:33.980]   Okay, I think they're good people.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.980]   Right?
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.540]   But I don't think you can walk in integrity in the military.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:44.180]   And I believe that you run the risk of signing yourself up for a great moral harm when you
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:50.420]   put yourself in a situation where you are making a voluntary choice to go and enlist
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:53.380]   in an organization that exists to kill people.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:48:00.180]   And that organization has proven itself to be lawless and the people that direct it,
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.180]   right?
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:06.940]   A commander in chief who basically uses the organization with minimal to no congressional
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:13.380]   oversight, no formal declaration of war, and just pops people into Kosovo, pops bombs,
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.100]   sends missiles into Kosovo and sends troops in here and troops in there.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.180]   I don't buy it.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:22.420]   Now, if you got into it, you would see enough situations where you felt like you did good
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:26.100]   that that's what those people, like I said, I like military guys, I always have.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.540]   But that's the first thing.
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:31.460]   The next thing, you are giving over control of your life.
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:34.100]   It's the exact opposite of freedom.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.500]   You are giving over control of your life.
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:42.180]   And even if you do something seemingly as benign as joining the reserves, and they say,
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:46.900]   listen, come out and spend a few weeks a year training with us and we'll give you some
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:50.300]   cool gear, we'll let you drive some cool gadgets, we'll let you learn a little bit
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.800]   about your specialty, etc.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.460]   You very well could be signing yourself up for a death sentence.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.300]   And I don't say that lightly.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:03.500]   We've had too many people, I have a friend of mine recently who she lost her, not recently,
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.840]   it was a number of years ago, but she lost her husband in Iraq, right?
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.700]   How many people go and join the reserves and then all of a sudden they find themselves
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.300]   sitting in Iraq for two years?
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.300]   Why?
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:15.300]   What was the point of it?
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.260]   And what's the point?
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:22.340]   How do you look, if I'm at your funeral and I'm talking to your widow, what do I
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.340]   say was the point?
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:26.380]   What do I say was the point?
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:29.140]   What was the point of Iraq and Afghanistan?
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:33.580]   A few years ago, I spent some time with a guy who had flown, who was a marine helicopter
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:35.340]   pilot in Afghanistan.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:40.700]   And again, the key is, as was the case with me as a financial planner.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:48.260]   A financial planner who is actively making his living as a financial planner has a very
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:54.820]   hard time being honest with himself, honest enough with himself to speak honestly about
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:55.820]   his industry.
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:02.860]   You have a very hard time convincing a man of something when his salary depends upon
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:04.620]   his believing otherwise.
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:14.460]   And so I found it very difficult for years to separate myself from even the job of being
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:18.780]   a financial planner to the point where I could look at it dispassionately and see the good
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:21.500]   things, see the bad things and have some sense of personal honesty.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:25.380]   And the same thing in my experience with people in the military.
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:29.700]   So anyway, I just remember a few years ago I met this marine helicopter pilot and we
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:36.380]   were in Utah at Zion National Park in Utah.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:40.180]   And we spent time and he was camping with his family and we just talked about it.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.740]   And he of course didn't share much about his actual experiences on the battlefield,
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:46.580]   but I just said like, "What was it worth?"
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:50.500]   And he's like, "I can't say that there was any point in being there."
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:56.100]   And I think about a guy like that after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:58.260]   And your heart breaks.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:04.700]   Here you were at the front end of the spear inflicting bodily harm and death on other
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.860]   people and what was it for?
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:10.140]   What do you tell your children that you were fighting for?
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:14.760]   It's difficult enough to defend things like World War II.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.260]   Very difficult to defend ethically things like World War II.
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:20.260]   But you can always point to the Holocaust.
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:25.020]   You can always point and say, "Look, we liberated the camps or we fought Hitler."
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:30.780]   And so you think, "Okay, well there was some justification."
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.720]   But it's harder to defend anything else.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:35.980]   So let me continue my list.
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.740]   Sorry, I got a little detracted.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:42.740]   So number one, you're dealing with not an employer.
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.540]   You're dealing with, I'm going to use this term, it's not quite the right term, but it
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.980]   evokes the right emotion.
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:54.140]   You're dealing with a slave master, meaning someone who controls your body and your time
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.740]   and every aspect of it.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:02.260]   You're voluntarily committing yourself to obey with virtually no questioning the orders
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:10.220]   of unknown men and women who literally will use you as cannon fodder.
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:17.820]   And they do that with your life.
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:18.820]   So what can it cost you?
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:22.460]   Number one, it can cost you your life.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:30.100]   Number two, let's say that you survive your time in the military and you're sent off in
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:36.740]   the reserves, you're sent off to war somewhere, but you survive.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:37.740]   You come back.
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:41.180]   And how many veterans commit suicide every day?
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:42.260]   It's stunning.
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.860]   It destroys men's souls.
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:45.500]   It destroys their brains.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.260]   It puts them through incredible trauma.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:54.620]   And because most of it is not morally defensible, the trauma just sticks with them.
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:58.700]   And it literally drives men to put a gun in their mouth every single day and pull the
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.700]   trigger.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   It's evil.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.060]   It's an evil system.
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:04.340]   And that's what you're potentially signing yourself up for.
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:06.660]   So you say, "Well, Joshua, that's unlikely, right?
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:07.860]   We're kind of tired of war.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:11.060]   We learned our lessons in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.540]   So what is it good for?"
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:14.580]   "Well, I'll go and I'll get some advanced training."
[01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:17.220]   I don't buy that you can't get that better.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.540]   And here I would refer you to my best anecdote.
[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:22.300]   I remember years ago, I heard Joel Salatin talk about this.
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:28.620]   Joel Salatin was invited by a local set of legislators.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:30.500]   And I forget all the details.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.900]   It was where he lives in Virginia.
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:35.660]   And he was supposed to serve on some kind of board or whatever.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.660]   He tells a story.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.100]   You can go and find it.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.620]   But he goes into this board and he was talking about something about farmers.
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:44.340]   And he's like, "We need to do blah, blah, blah with farmers, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:49.180]   And a legislator said out loud what we all know is true.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:57.020]   But he says, "We need farmers because we need people to serve in the military."
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:02.140]   And the basic idea was that instead of allowing farmers to actually build wealth, he was—I
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:04.100]   wish I could do the anecdote more justice.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:08.780]   But instead of—it was a shocking statement to come out of his local legislator's mouth.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:16.340]   But basically, you need to understand that government representatives view that they
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:23.380]   need stupid poor people to sign up and serve in the military because they need bodies and
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:26.140]   they need people who believe in the sense of patriotism.
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:29.660]   They need people who believe in the sense of duty to country.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:34.300]   And the people who do this are poor people, they're country people, and they're farmers.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:41.580]   And so they waive things like they're people from poor backgrounds, inner city, and they
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:43.900]   waive things like, "Oh, get a college education."
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:48.100]   They waive all this stuff at them, "Get a VA loan," et cetera, because they're getting
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.140]   poor people.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:55.500]   You will never find in the modern world, you will never find a wealthy family, a sophisticated,
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.360]   connected family that would send their child into the military.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:06.280]   It's all people who have no options, no opportunities, no intelligence, meaning that—what I mean
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:10.080]   is they don't see the other options, they don't have enough mentors around them to show
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:11.960]   them the better path.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.760]   And so then they go and they sign up for the military.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.260]   And so many of them wind up destroyed by the experience.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:20.560]   And so even if you come out the other side and you just went to reserve training and
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.300]   you never got deployed and, "Yeah, I got a VA loan now," what is that really worth
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:28.360]   as compared to the risk?
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.440]   A VA loan is not going to change your life.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.000]   Access to TRICARE is not going to change your life.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:42.000]   Access to the college funding, the GI Bill, is not going to change your life.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.520]   So if you got those things, they can be useful tools in the hands of a financial planner,
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.520]   right?
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.540]   I've known multiple people, many veterans, they get their medical care from the VA, fine.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.760]   They get a VA loan, great, go for it.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.080]   They got TRICARE, they got a disability benefit, go for it.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.720]   But the problem is that the risks are so high of it going another way that I think that
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:12.440]   getting a VA loan, getting a GI Bill, et cetera, is very, very poor compensation for the risk
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.800]   on the other side.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.160]   And if you're smart enough to ask the question of, "Should I do this?"
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.200]   And if you're smart enough to already be working in that industry, I believe that joining the
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.720]   military would be one of the most, at the very least, one of the most inefficient ways
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.520]   for you to accomplish your goals.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:33.840]   And in the worst case scenario, potentially cost you your life, potentially cost your
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.420]   soul, potentially cost you your sense of peace, et cetera.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:48.920]   And so I think that just in conclusion, a cold look at the pay, the benefits, et cetera,
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:58.240]   as compared to what you can get without that, a cold look at that would say that there's
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:06.360]   very little benefit for a person who has income, for someone who's not penniless.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.240]   I always want to be careful because there's no question that many people have had their
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:12.400]   lives improved by the military.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:17.040]   There are many stories of people who grew up in poverty, I didn't have a dad, and I
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.960]   went into the military and I found my buddies and I found my father, my father figure in
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:24.800]   Sergeant So-and-so who straightened me out.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.560]   I went on the straight and narrow and I went in and I did my four years and I got out and
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:34.120]   I was a totally different man.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:39.840]   There are those stories, but that same guy who did have that good experience is offset
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.320]   by the guys every single day who are putting a gun in their mouth because they can't deal
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:44.320]   with what they did.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:45.320]   They can't deal with what they saw.
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.920]   They can't deal with what happened to them.
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:54.360]   From a practical perspective, I can't see why the military is a good move.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:03.520]   And then from a sense of honor and duty, this desire to love neighbors, protect and serve,
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:09.640]   freedom, make sure that we live in a free world, most of those things just cannot be
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:12.680]   borne out by the military.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.760]   I wrestle with this every Veterans Day and Fourth of July.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.720]   It's like, well, what do I tell my children about things like protecting freedom?
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:26.760]   What freedom has the US military ever protected for Americans?
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:31.800]   There's no question, okay, we liberated the camps of Jews that were going to be murdered.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.320]   Fine, but what freedom has the US military ever protected for Americans?
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.480]   My entire lifetime and my entire reading of history has shown that we've gone from the
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:49.720]   highest levels of freedom in the world in, say, 1750, to significantly lower levels of
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:52.480]   freedom in, say, 1780.
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:58.340]   And since then, the decline of freedom has been inexorable, and I can't find a military
[01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:02.520]   conflict that has actually resulted in increased levels of freedom.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.280]   Rather, I find that almost every military conflict has resulted in decreased levels
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.360]   of freedom.
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:12.320]   And so most of the whole freedom thing is pablum, as best I can tell.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.080]   So if you want to defend freedom, I think your best solution is go become a lawyer and
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.360]   fight in the courts.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.040]   If you want to defend your freedom and your neighbors, go and encourage people and teach
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.800]   firearms training in your local community, encourage people to own weapons.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.080]   That's the best way to encourage freedom in the local area, et cetera.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:34.080]   So I went on a little bit long, but it's obviously a difficult thing and an emotionally laden
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   thing.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:38.660]   But if you were my younger brother, that's the speech I would give you to say, I can't
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:46.500]   see how or why anybody would want to join the military, especially in the modern world.
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:49.680]   Consider after Afghanistan.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:55.360]   Consider who your commanders in chief are, meaning who your commander in chief is and/or
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.880]   who your commander in chief would be.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:04.080]   Do you respect that man or that woman to the point where you would sign up to take the
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.760]   pledge to obey them?
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:12.640]   And do you want to be used as a political tool for influence in the modern world?
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:13.720]   I can't see it.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:18.400]   So forgive me if that was a little bit strong, but that is my honest answer to your question.
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.160]   And I give you the floor.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:24.680]   No, no, I really appreciate your insight.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.920]   I mean, I agree with you on all those points.
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.600]   So I appreciate it.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.600]   I think that--
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.600]   I would--
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.600]   Go ahead.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:34.600]   Go ahead.
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:35.600]   I talked for a long time.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.600]   Go ahead.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:37.600]   Oh, no.
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:41.720]   I was just going to bring up a second question that's unrelated.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.920]   Well, then let me just say one more comment.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.960]   Here's what I would say.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:52.040]   You take every single one of the benefits, the reasons why you wanted to join the military
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.440]   or want to join the military or are thinking about joining the military.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.400]   And then just call me back once a week, and we'll take one of them at a time.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.400]   How do I enhance my career?
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:02.520]   And I'll give you a 20-minute speech on things you can do with your career.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.560]   And going to reserve training is never going to be on that list.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:10.280]   So again, it all comes down to opportunity cost.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:13.160]   For the-- that's why I try to be thoughtful.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:18.400]   I want to be honest, but I don't want to be hyperbolic.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.020]   There's no question that there have been many people whose lives have been improved by the
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.340]   military.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:28.360]   These were generally people with no network, no parents, no opportunities, nobody who reached
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.920]   out and helped them.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:37.600]   And so for them, the opportunity cost was, well, I'm going to be stuck in poverty, or
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.440]   I'm going to be-- I'm going to have no friends or no opportunities.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.440]   OK, great.
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:45.480]   The military was a better move for them if they survive it.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.480]   But for you, that's certainly not the case.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:59.440]   And so you can replace with the military with better strategies that don't have so many
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.160]   downsides and potential downsides.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.280]   And before you say your second question, I just want to say this.
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:07.640]   I understand that this is an extremely inflammatory opinion.
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:15.600]   I hope that those of you who are in my audience who are in the military and who are doing
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:22.640]   it with the noblest of intentions, I hope that you understand that I respect your desires
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.000]   and I respect your intentions.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.360]   My assessment is what I have said.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.000]   I don't see how it can be otherwise.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.400]   And I've asked enough people and talked to enough people that I think that many of my
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.560]   listeners who would agree with me ideologically and psychologically or who would share some
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:41.320]   of the things that I care about would often agree with me.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:48.280]   But I don't intend to, I'm not saying that you as an individual have done wrong.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.640]   There's many people who think they can change it.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.560]   There's many people who serve for many reasons.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.520]   I think it's a lost cause at this point in time.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:00.980]   And I think that it's a lost cause and that one of the best things you can do if you're
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:06.240]   in the military is get out as quickly and as reasonably as you can for the reasons stated.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:12.280]   So go ahead with your second question and we'll wrap up on hopefully a less potentially
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:14.680]   inflammatory question.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:18.000]   >>Adam: Yeah, sure.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.520]   So what is your opinion on using, like investing in treasury inflation protected securities
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:31.320]   or inflation adjusted treasury bonds or whatever they're called, like for short term savings
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.880]   such as to save for a down payment on a house?
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:41.160]   I was looking at one of the Vanguard mutual funds, I think it's Vips, and it paid about
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:50.400]   like 10% in interest, which depending on your inflation calculations, might have kind of
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.560]   tracked the long inflation for the past year and is definitely way better than any bank
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:04.400]   account while at the same time being far less risky than equities or any kind of like DeFi
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.400]   arrangement.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:12.160]   But I don't really hear anybody recommending this avenue for short term savings.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.440]   I'm kind of missing or wondering if I'm missing anything there.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:20.840]   >>Tavis: I would never think of this avenue for short term savings, but I don't have a
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:24.400]   clear argument as to why I wouldn't.
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:29.760]   So do me a favor, send me a link, either whatever brochure, whatever you're looking at, send
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.760]   it to me at joshuatradicalpersonalfinance.com.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:38.440]   Let me look at it because this is not something that I have on my mental menu of options,
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:41.040]   but now I'm wondering why I don't.
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:46.440]   I don't think that tips are the greatest option of all time for retirees and protecting your
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.080]   money against inflation.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:53.060]   And I have some arguments there, but I need to think and consider from a short term perspective
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:55.520]   and see is there some cost that I'm missing?
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.640]   Is there something?
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.880]   Why isn't that on my menu?
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.800]   So send it to me, joshuatradicalpersonalfinance.com.
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:03.160]   I will review and then we'll go from there.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:04.160]   Fair enough?
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:05.160]   >>Joshua: Okay.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.160]   Yes.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:07.160]   >>Tavis: Wonderful.
[02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:08.160]   >>Joshua: Thank you.
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.240]   >>Tavis: And with that, looks like my other two callers dropped off, which is probably
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.040]   good given we're already at two hours here.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:18.920]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:19.920]   Thank you for being here.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.820]   I enjoyed the questions.
[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:25.760]   Quite stimulating and quite diverse and I love doing these shows.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:31.600]   It's hard for me to give answers that I know are offensive to people from whatever perspective,
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.160]   but I do try to – I made myself a promise years ago.
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.160]   I will be honest.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.160]   So thank you for listening.
