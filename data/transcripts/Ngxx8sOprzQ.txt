[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   shorts I was wearing them all last week at future proof but we've got an extended summer
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.960]   here so I'm still getting some shorts as but we're inching closer to jogger season and
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.640]   after jogger season in the fall then we inched even closer to sweatpants season and the great
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   thing about these is that they also have the built-in liner just like the shorts and the
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.440]   side pocket so it feels like you're wearing the bird dog shorts even though they're joggers
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.960]   or pants plus they have the the stretch khakis as well which easily one of the harder words
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.920]   in the English language to spell is the stretch khakis but they're great because they have
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960]   the same material as the shorts they're very comfortable and kind of stretch and move and
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.240]   remember if you go to birddogs.com/ATC you get one of these white stretch tech hats which
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.440]   are very cool I still owe you one Duncan I keep saying that but I still have it ATC is
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.080]   the is the code when you check out also just FYI I think I think StreamYard might have
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.440]   been delayed taking us live there so I think people might have missed some of the beginning
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   part so just the TL;DR is I'm coming coming in live from Frankfurt Germany and Ben made
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.360]   a joke about me wearing wederhosen so yeah in case you missed that all right I had to
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.960]   look it up to remember what that was called I was gonna I had a very fun day at the Hofbrauhaus
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.000]   when I was in college before which is all I need to say but I know you're gonna be there
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.600]   for Oktoberfest you're going you're kind of traveling all over Germany right yeah yeah
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.200]   Berlin down to Munich yeah everything okay here's I have one question for you finance
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.520]   wise did you check that your credit card allows free foreign transactions before you left
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.200]   I did yeah yeah I'm using the Sapphire Reserve for pretty much everything here so just making
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   sure it's kind of nice you don't have to I remember when I went there in college I had
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.540]   to like exchange money all the time and you'd get just screwed on the the transaction fees
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.360]   and the whatever the currency exchange rate was they'd always you know I feel like they
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.700]   took two or three percent off every time so yeah a lot more places now are accepting
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.680]   cards too when I came here years ago it was more you know cash only kind of stuff but
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.640]   now I'm seeing a lot more credit so we're catching up they're going there in the future
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.440]   dogecoin that sort of thing right all right let's do a question okay up first today we
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.160]   have I'm 39 with no kids or dependents I'm a registered nurse with an annual income close
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.680]   to $110,000 I have $370,000 in my 401k $190,000 in an IRA and $220,000 in my brokerage account
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.660]   not to brag that's me not them I currently reside in a duplex where I rent out both my
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.300]   basement and second floor my outstanding mortgage balance is $190,000 at a fixed rate of 2.8%
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.740]   for 30 years additionally I have an investment property which is paid in full per Zillow
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.620]   the estimated value of my primary residence stands at $400,000 while my investment property
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.260]   is valued at $650,000 I'm contemplating using the equity I've built up to further my real
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.260]   estate portfolio or explore alternative investment avenues I'm faced with the decision of whether
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.100]   to leverage a home equity loan even with high interest rates or wait for a potential rate
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.460]   change also is it wise to use my equity to buy more stocks I think it's a pretty impressive
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.660]   question coming from a 39 year old yeah he's in a pretty good position having one house
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.540]   paid off and a 2.8% mortgage on another one puts Joel here in a pretty good position but
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.060]   he's he's come to the he's realizing the problem though he's house rich right and the thing
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.860]   you realize once you have a house paid off you have a lot of it paid off you have equity
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.820]   is great he no longer has the payments on the one house and the payments are obviously
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.380]   probably low on the other one but that all that equity sitting there it's you once you
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.500]   have it you start thinking well what good is it doing I can't spend my house I can't
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.180]   sell shares of my house like I could with a stock if it's appreciated in value and use
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.300]   it for something else the liquidity is the problem so there are some options here but
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.380]   I think none of them are really a slam dunk so you could open up a home equity line of
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.860]   credit or do a cash out refinance but then we're talking borrowing it at ridiculous rates
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.580]   so seven and change probably if you did a cash out refi right now and eight to nine
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.940]   percent for a home equity line of credit which does not sound great so if you're planning
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.540]   on taking that money out and looking at other investment opportunities that's a really high
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.180]   hurdle rate I would prefer the HELOC at this moment than a cash out refi because those
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.820]   rates could fall when when other rates fall it'll fall faster you don't have to refi and
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.940]   you don't have to spend that you don't have to start making their debt repayments right
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.660]   away we've talked about the HELOC before you could use that equity in your home and just
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.340]   sell it and use it for a down payment on new house but then again you have the higher mortgage
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.860]   rates the reverse mortgage is something we've talked about in the past but he's 39 years
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.380]   old so you have to be older to do that so again having home equity is a wonderful thing
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.540]   but what are you supposed to do with it there he does have a very concentrated position
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.460]   in real estate with owning two houses even though one of them paid off the great thing
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.660]   is you don't have those down payment or those monthly payments anymore so you could take
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.420]   that money that you would have been paying for monthly payments and diversify that way
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.380]   but I think something that a lot of people who own rental properties probably don't think
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.420]   about is why don't you just sell it right it's kind of like retirees with their principal
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.060]   they say like I'm never touching my principal I'm only living on the income it's a psychological
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.260]   thing where people I think people once they get rental properties even if they'd appreciate
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.900]   in value they go no I'm getting this rental income it's doing great for me and the way
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.380]   that real estate investors look at this is through a cap rate so let's say you have the
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.700]   house valued at $600,000 or whatever let's say you're netting $2,500 a month so you're
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.780]   not making payments anymore so after taxes and stuff and maintenance let's say you're
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.260]   netting 2,500 bucks a month on that that's a $30,000 a year that's a 5% cap rate call
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.020]   it on a $600,000 house so could that money be put to work and obviously you can play
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.140]   with the numbers and figure out how much you're actually bringing in to figure out what that
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.540]   cap rate is so could that money be put to work elsewhere with better returns possibly
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.340]   I don't know maybe some people just like being landlords you can increase the rent each year
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.860]   to account for inflation Duncan you're a renter you know how this works I actually re-upped
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.180]   my office lease this week and Bill Sweet was looking through the contract with me I've
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.940]   been in the same office since 2015 it's still barely standing even though it's even though
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.420]   there's been a few floods and a few problems my office is okay I still like it it's close
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.260]   to my house and so I re-upped again and Bill and I actually calculated what's the inflation
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.260]   rate been since 2015 when I first moved in and surprisingly it it almost identically
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.980]   matches the rate of inflation so it's 3.4% per year my rent has gone up and CPI in that
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:25.100]   time has gone up 3.3% per year not bad so it's yeah not too bad so I just I think right
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.460]   now is not the environment to be a borrower so he asked about could I just wait until
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.060]   the rates situation is better and yeah I don't know how long that will be but I wouldn't
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.340]   feel great about borrowing at 7 to 9% right now that's a pretty high hurdle rate I think
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.900]   a lot of it depends on how much you care about owning real estate because again I you could
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.860]   just sell the house you don't you don't have to it does sound pretty cool though to be
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.500]   39 and be able to like refer to your real estate portfolio right but I think I think
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.540]   the reason he's having this this internal tug-of-war is he realizes like I have all
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.420]   this equity sitting there and I can't do anything with it yes the home equity line of credit
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.700]   sounds good but that that works better typically if you borrow to do a you know fix the house
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.580]   up or something so maybe you could you could fix your house up or you could I don't know
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.660]   kick your your renters out of your duplex and and live like a king I don't know I think
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.900]   but I think it's okay to think about selling it especially in an environment where there's
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.340]   not much supply and and the house is probably appreciated in price a lot and then you then
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.460]   you you have that liquidity event and then now what are you gonna do you have a ton of
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.020]   money to put the work somewhere else I think it's I would at least consider that as opposed
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.500]   to holding the real estate and I think probably what he's thinking about is yeah I'll take
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.020]   some out I'll use it as a down payment for a new place and put some leverage on it then
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.720]   I don't care as much about the borrowing and I guess that makes sense too but I just be
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.780]   worried about the the rates being so high right now yeah John Carlo in the chat asks
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.860]   are there arm adjustable rate he locks well he locks are technically adjustable rate as
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.140]   it is like the rate fluctuates it's like a live or plus something or whatever whatever
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.980]   prime rate plus something so it'll fluctuate but it with rates this high it's it's going
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.340]   in the wrong direction and they who knows they could go higher gotcha that's a but yeah
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.420]   the hope would be that you could I don't know pay it off with the income and if if you're
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.820]   borrowing at seven or eight percent and it's only for a couple years and you pay off it's
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.060]   for down payment and maybe it's not so bad because that the longer term is what hurts
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.380]   you there but yeah good for you good finance position obviously yeah yeah a few not the
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.140]   brags all right let's do another one another another housing when we've gotten a lot of
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.660]   housing ones here all right up next we have a question from max I'm 30 and recently divorced
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.260]   I received a hundred and thirty thousand dollars settlement for a house we purchased in 2021
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.580]   she stayed in the house total liquid assets are two hundred and sixty five thousand dollars
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.580]   plus fifty thousand dollars in my 401k I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and make a hundred
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.060]   and twenty five thousand dollars base with sixty thousand dollars variable salary and
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.140]   my rent is twenty six hundred dollars a month having lost a five hundred thousand dollar
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.420]   mortgage at three percent I feel I'm stuck without a home in the current market friends
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.180]   are taking out seven thousand dollar monthly mortgages when comparable rents are four to
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.700]   five thousand dollars how is that sustainable how am I supposed to purchase something at
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.420]   six to seven percent on a single income I've explored land purchases to create Airbnbs
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.140]   or purchasing a rental property but barring costs and high prices make this feel impossible
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.460]   I feel like I'm not getting the full value of my two hundred and sixty five thousand
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.420]   dollars and I'm unsure of how to allocate it for my financial future aside from getting
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:30.820]   another wife to pay half the bills what should I do okay I understand the consternation here
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.060]   this is a tough break obviously divorces sorry to hear it yeah sorry to hear I mean that's
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.300]   always difficult from an emotional perspective but there are financial considerations as
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.540]   well I also wonder number in wedding crashers Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's characters
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.580]   are like divorce settlement attorneys and they help the negotiation I would love to
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.060]   know how those negotiations went for a three percent mortgage because how much is that
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.240]   worth in a seven percent environment like do you think that this guy kind of got screwed
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.840]   a little bit for his paint payout yeah I would have I would have done some discounted cash
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.420]   flow analysis something I'm not I'm not trying to say you got screwed but I think you might
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.060]   have got screwed because yeah that's all I was thinking that sounded a little low given
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.580]   what he's talking about yeah and I I've made this joke before but I've heard of stay together
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.220]   for the kids I wonder how many people are staying together for the three percent mortgage
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:20.720]   these days right stay together for the mortgage all right so Max here is in a tough spot the
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.340]   housing market is broken in many ways affordability about as bad as it's been we've talked about
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.840]   this before plus he lives in the Bay Area where house prices were unaffordable before
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.340]   we got to seven seven and a half percent or it was great yeah but I think there's a lot
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.220]   of peer pressure in these especially since he's 30 when it comes to the housing market
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.140]   and it's like you have to buy a house why are you paying someone else's rent you have
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.380]   to build equity I'm sure people have heard these ones before or he's thinking it himself
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.100]   here's the secret especially if you live in a high-cost moving area buying a house is
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.260]   not for everyone I know it seems like it has to be but owning a home is not for everyone
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.820]   yes it's a wonderful hedge against inflation it's a for savings vehicle it offers this
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.280]   wonderful form of psychic income that's really hard to match but that doesn't mean everyone
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.180]   has to buy a house here's the here's the list of people who shouldn't buy a home number
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.820]   one you want to retain some level of flexibility in your personal life or your career because
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.820]   you move around or whatever you don't want to put pay all the ancillary costs that come
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.700]   with a home ownership I've heard the line before that when you pay your rent your your
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.780]   housing costs are done right but when you pay your mortgage that's just the start of
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.100]   your housing costs mortgage plus all these things yeah another one is you just don't
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.180]   want all the responsibilities of owning a home it's the landscaping the upkeep it can
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.940]   be a lot for some people I think if you don't live in the house long enough to cover the
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.900]   swishing costs from buying selling moving closing costs all these things other people
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.160]   I think if you run the numbers and realize renting makes more sense for your financial
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.860]   situation and I think the last one is if you live in a high cost of living area I think
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.740]   the first one about retaining flexibility makes sense here because this guy just got
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.320]   a divorce his life is probably in a state of upheaval I don't know if he wants to think
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.140]   about moving somewhere else or if he has the potential for a job maybe he just loves living
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.220]   in the Bay Area because of friends or family or he just he just really likes it but I think
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.180]   the last two make the most sense you run the numbers and realize renting is better for
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.900]   you or you live in a high cost of living area right I think you know as he pointed out in
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.820]   his question buying is just more expensive than renting he's paying $2,600 a month in
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.060]   rent and $7,000 for mortgage or whatever Redfin actually did this analysis and they looked
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.660]   at the largest premiums in terms of renting versus buying and John throw up my chart here
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.180]   this is from Redfin and it looks at home ownership premiums so in San Jose is the worst one it's
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:35.540]   165% more expensive to buy than to rent San Francisco it's almost 140% you can see the
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:40.620]   top ones here are almost all California right and this analysis was done on mortgage rates
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.180]   for 6.5% because they did this a few months ago now it's like 7.3% at the latest I think
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.860]   so John do the next one which is the most populous cities this is like the most populous
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.300]   cities with the biggest premium you can see a lot of them are in the Bay Area San Francisco
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:00.380]   Oakland Anaheim it's a lot of West Coast places a lot of California and it's just so I looked
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.500]   at the the median home price in San Francisco is like 1.4 million dollars kind of sounds
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.700]   like a lot so if you wanted to buy and you put 20% down that's 280 grand and you said
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.340]   your liquid net worth is 265 so it's your whole liquid net worth plus 15 extra thousand
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.980]   dollars plus closing costs and all that stuff with a 7.3% fixed rate mortgage over 30 years
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.260]   we're talking $7,700 and that's before property taxes insurance HOA maintenance is it really
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:35.020]   worth it to use all of your liquid financial assets and spend $5,000 more a month or more
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.500]   for your monthly payment just so you can own instead of rent for I mean for some people
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.180]   the numbers might not matter they simply want to buy a house no matter what ensure you have
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.740]   the ability to refinance even if you refinance that mortgage if rates went down to 5% you're
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.140]   back you're at $6,000 a month so my point is you don't have to buy a home just because
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.180]   society says you do especially in a situation like today you have to run the numbers you
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.780]   have to understand your circumstances and I don't think you need to be in a rush especially
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:06.460]   if your life has come up under like some big upheaval right so buying a house can be a
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.220]   wise financial decision for some people it doesn't have to be for everyone I say don't
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.660]   be in a hurry and and wait just because someone says you're paying someone else's mortgage
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.660]   because if you can take those savings figure out what you'd be paying in a mortgage and
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.240]   save the difference you're gonna be you're gonna be a pretty good place financially maybe
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.860]   in a few years you do feel like okay I've saved enough now I want to go ahead and buy
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:34.060]   then imagine how expensive California would be if they didn't have earthquakes that's
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:40.020]   the trade-off the earthquakes and wildfires kind of balance it out but it's still ridiculously
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.380]   expensive to live there obviously yeah but yeah I if you're in a high cost of living
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.980]   area like that and rent is that much cheaper don't be in a hurry to buy just because you
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:55.180]   think you have to owning a home is not for everyone good advice says the homeowner right
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:07.380]   fair stay away from my house let's see I'm in my early 20s with a stable job should I
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.980]   sell down assets in my Roth to pay off credit card debt okay you got a nice and succinct
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.140]   this question is you what did you say does to ask how do you I can't even say the name
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:22.860]   about how yeah we do get a lot of information from our from a lot of very long questions
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.620]   yeah what you see on the show is actually the abbreviated version usually yeah people
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.380]   want to make sure that we got all the bases covered okay Duncan what's Ben's number one
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.500]   rule of personal finance pay off debt pay off your credit card debt right not paying
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.820]   off your credit card debt each month is a personal finance killer it's like Jim Simons
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.260]   level of compounding but against you right it's like in the opposite direction so I don't
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.860]   think you necessarily have to pay off like liquidate your Roth to pay off your credit
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.500]   card you it is an option but you I would just recommend that you'd use the contributions
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.340]   from your Roth and not take out any gains that you might have because then you have
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.940]   to pay an early withdrawal penalty but you that's one of the benefits of a Roth is that
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.500]   you can take out the contributions tax and penalty free so I think this decision probably
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.420]   comes down to loss aversion versus debt aversion loss aversion I've been trying to teach my
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.760]   daughter this lately that losses sting twice as bad as gains make you feel good like when
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.060]   her favorite team loses it makes her feel worse than the winds feel good so I think
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.780]   if seeing a chunk of your Roth assets just that evaporate even if it makes your debt
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.420]   go away if you can't handle that I think that's one way to think about a debt aversion I think
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.260]   if it just causes you pain all the time to be in this debt and you feel like it's just
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.900]   a burden and a weight on you then maybe taking out some of those Roth conversions make sense
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   I think you could start the initial first step would be just stop making any further
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Ross contributions and use whatever contributions you're making to pay off your credit card
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.500]   debt I think that's a good first step you could also look into a zero percent credit
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.620]   card and do a balance transfer Duncan we've been talking about this lately a lot of these
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.740]   places will allow you to open up a zero percent credit card for 15 18 21 months and then you
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.460]   pay 3% for a balance transfer now that sounds like a lot until you realize that you're paying
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.660]   a 27% or something on a credit card interest so I think that's a pretty good first step
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.660]   and that'll give you some breathing room to pay it off slowly instead of trying to pay
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.460]   it off all at once and again I think you can then take your Roth contributions use those
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.320]   to pay credit card debt once the credit card debt is paid off then roll those payments
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.260]   right into your Roth again so you can kind of play catch up and then you're you're in
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:26.680]   business that's the route that I recently to so yeah it's I mean 3% with my track record
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.020]   that's not that high of a hurdle rate in the market you know right yeah compared to Oatly
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:38.740]   options it's pretty good yeah so and the other thing is I would for all your credit cards
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.260]   going forward like paying it off would be nice but it makes no difference if you're
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.420]   just gonna rack up more credit card debt in the future click that autopay button to pay
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.220]   the entire balance each month and hold yourself accountable to pay it off and don't let it
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:55.500]   roll over each month yeah I mean this math is much clearer if you are paying 24 27% interest
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.180]   on a balance on a credit card like you got to get rid of that right I mean that's that's
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.340]   brutal yes that that's ridiculous so it figure out a way to do that all right cool let's
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.780]   do another long one up next yeah up next we have a question from Jeff I'm retiring in
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:15.080]   a month at 56 with a four million dollar portfolio no debt a three hundred thousand dollar severance
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.060]   package and a 5.2 million dollar net worth Jeff's pretty set in my opinion but non-professional
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.420]   opinion I'm married with two daughters college paid for I know it seems dumb but I'm trying
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:34.740]   to decide on a 50/50 simple for fund ETF portfolio versus my 55/45 simple for fund portfolio
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.380]   in perpetuity that's a hard word it's the difference of a hundred and fifty thousand
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.060]   dollars which is probably relatively small compared to the entire portfolio but I keep
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.780]   reading about how going to a 50/50 at the start of retirement is important to avoid
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:55.340]   sequence of returns risk I've put three years of cash away in a 5% t-bill ETF and we'd be
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.900]   very comfortable living off a 3% withdrawal rate I've always followed a monthly DCA plan
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.340]   and rebalance yearly and it's served us well it's weird but I'm stressing over this but
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:11.980]   I would like to only retire once a simple go for it will suffice and I'll do the 55/45
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.340]   I don't want to be greedy and have too many equities and don't want to be stupid by being
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.540]   overly conservative I'm going to need you to break this one down all right Dave in the
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.740]   chat says he wants Jeff to just simply adopt him because he's got somebody not to brag
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.740]   here this sounds like an asset allocation question because it's like should I be 50/50
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.580]   or 55/45 but it's really a financial planning and even more behavioral finance question
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.980]   so let's bring a financial advisor in here to help us out with this one Nick Sapienza
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:43.060]   hey guys Nick I think I think Jeff here has been reading Michael Kitsis who have some
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.380]   research on this that says early in retirement sequence of return risk can kill you because
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.500]   if you start out with a bear market and you sell your stocks you're gonna put yourself
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.380]   into a hole so I think that's what Jeff is worried about here should I get more conservative
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.420]   but obviously the the difference I think between 55/45 and 50/50 is kind of splitting hairs
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.380]   here yeah exactly I just want to call out a few things from the question right 56 married
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.180]   two daughters college paid for four million dollars investable no debt $300,000 severance
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:18.100]   package 5.2 million dollar net worth and the question is 50/50 versus 55/45 it's a difference
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:25.340]   of 5% or $150,000 right these are minimal differences when in the grand scheme of things
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.660]   and he mentioned reducing sequence of returns with so just to back into that we talked about
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.420]   this the first time I was on a few months ago it's the order in which you get a bear
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.780]   market so like to Jeff's fear is what if I'm retiring and this is the top of the market
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:46.620]   like it was in 2000 or 2008 what happens to my portfolio but he's already mitigated probably
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.740]   95% of those risks right he's the biggest risk for sequence of returns is you're forced
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.700]   to sell your stocks when they're in a bear market right so that's that's that's the hardest
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.780]   part is you don't have to sell when they're down because if you're the timing every withdrawals
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.940]   works out bad where you're down 40% and you're selling your stocks then you're you're setting
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.900]   yourself up for potentially failure in retirement yeah exactly you can't make it to the other
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.660]   side of the bear market or secular bear market where you run into the bull market and that
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.740]   usually would offset that right you have to worry about running out of money but in his
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.940]   case low withdrawal rate a three-year cash buffer I mean usually it's like one or two
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:26.540]   years so he's gotten more on that side and then assuming he's got in that for ETF portfolio
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:31.660]   it's globally diversified it's not just entirely in like one specific country or sector or
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.220]   anything like that lastly it's the behavior piece that mitigates that sequence of returns
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.860]   risk is behavior and impulse control so whether or not he can stick with it we've got a few
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.540]   charts here just to you know go down the rabbit hole for fun and explore this a little bit
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.540]   the first one is just comparing the differences in the 50/50 versus the 55/45 the difference
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.980]   is half percent per year which is meaningful especially over a 40 year time horizon which
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:01.460]   is what Jeff potentially faces right and so it's again it's really look at that chart
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.900]   it's it's it's I mean you're hugging the line there either either one you're you're you're
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.940]   pretty much going to be in the same spot exactly and these are kind of like cherry-picked dates
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.700]   right well I mean at least we've got you know a full market cycle and and a few bear markets
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.580]   embedded in this but it's neck and neck there's like no difference whatsoever the next chart
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.740]   is okay well what if Jeff's thinking in terms of you know he's backtesting his portfolio
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.060]   and he's thinking in terms of maximum drawdown and he says and the way that he's gotten to
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.140]   50/50 or 55/45 is not just so much by sequence of returns risk but his max pain threshold
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:36.500]   he said this is the most pain that I can tolerate and in you know it's at 31 I mean you're looking
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:44.860]   at 31% in 2008 for a 50/50 portfolio and then on the next chart you'll see the 55/45 breakdown
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.300]   now this is the act we enact so this is a globally diversified portfolio the 55/45 you're
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:56.220]   looking at a negative 34% drawdown in 2008 so again not really a huge difference if you
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:02.580]   look at the long-term average 4.78 versus 4.36 on the average drawdown this is pennies
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.940]   and so really what this comes down to is that the best plan is the one that you can stick
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.700]   with my thoughts on this whole topic or that you know Jeff is splitting hairs and typically
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.020]   when we split hairs it's usually about something else so the thing is not the thing this isn't
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.220]   really a stock or bond question this is am I going to be okay okay question Jeff needs
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   the validation that he's making the right decision so that he can have conviction in
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.460]   his own plan and he could move forward with that and stop second-guessing it right it
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.300]   sounds to me like Jeff might need to talk to a professional just to be like tell me
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.820]   I'm gonna be okay because we could put all take all these inputs and put them into a
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.740]   financial planning software and run to Monte Carlo simulations and I'm guessing either
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.260]   one of these would show you know you have a very high probability of succeeding in your
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:49.060]   financial plan right regardless of the allocation so it's just you know this is perfect being
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.940]   the enemy of good here and in just being like I need someone to help me make this decision
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.820]   just point direction he's got everything else right but he's I think he's missing the psychological
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.140]   aspect of this is that decumulation is a difference is a different mindset than accumulation right
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.460]   he's always stuck to and been very disciplined in a DCA plan but now he's taking assets out
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.180]   and even if we know the math and he's probably he's probably looked at money Carlo calculations
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.180]   but even if we know the math it's really hard for us to reconcile the fact that we can take
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.540]   a hundred and twenty thousand or you know three percent out of a portfolio every year
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.780]   maybe increase that by inflation and yet if he's read kids this if he's read the sequence
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:32.380]   of returns papers he could on average according to the data end up with maybe six times more
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.420]   than the amount that he started with despite the bear markets corrections you know dips
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.380]   and everything else that accompanies right he's obviously conservative enough by holding
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.540]   three years in cash so that that piece to me that that's like how do you fight sequence
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.500]   of return this Duncan you said it's yeah you have a cash buffer it's a cash buffer in diversification
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   that that's it so he's got that he's got to figure out so that being conservative he's
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.620]   got that that totally like tied up in a neat bow seems fine yeah I just kind of need someone
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.580]   to help him decide he wants them to say yes you can you're gonna be okay and we don't
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.420]   know exactly how the future is gonna play out but I think based on the circumstances
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.140]   you're doing pretty good it always helps to have that third party that's unemotional and
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.100]   that can pick apart your you know sort of it's you know I don't want to say distorted
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.980]   thoughts but just slightly disrupted thinking about his portfolio and really focusing on
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.300]   one thing stressing over too much and I think one more point like one thing that he's maybe
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.540]   not focusing on and and Jeff don't mean to throw a wrench into this you can you've got
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.260]   plenty of time you can kick this can down the road but is longevity risk he's 56 he
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.980]   might need his plan to last for 40 years so he is focusing a lot on minimizing downside
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.180]   making the right decisions but at the same point you can't constrain upside Nick you
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.180]   just caused Jeff to go into like an eight-year cash but I did I shouldn't have said it take
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.620]   it back delete this I take it back well I'm guessing to I mean revisit this in five years
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:55.060]   Jeff but just get the 5545 gone having this level of wealth I'm guessing Jeff is really
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   into doing this on his own right I'm like managing that could be that could be feeling
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.340]   those people would be like you know what he's obviously done yeah he said his research and
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.660]   maybe doesn't want to take his hands off the steering wheel but I think you can at least
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.980]   talk to someone it doesn't have to be a relationship that you're in forever it could be a one-time
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.060]   hourly kind of meeting if you yeah you can talk to planners on an hourly basis that won't
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.820]   take that won't take over the investment management piece that that is available that is an option
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.460]   and I think that's definitely a good idea for him to get that affirmation but all right
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.420]   so my my my my takeaway is is go forward but also you know leaves room for flexibility
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.580]   sorry yep you got to be flexible all right next question Duncan hey up next we have a
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:39.380]   question from Lars my small business employer uses a simple IRA it caps out at fifteen thousand
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.540]   five hundred dollars this year so I effectively lose out on thousands of dollars of potential
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:49.580]   investing each year compared to my previous and previous large employer that I had a 401k
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.500]   with what is the purpose of this difference why does it feel like I'm being penalized
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:03.100]   for working for a small business I'll be muted you're muted in oh sorry I don't know why
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:09.140]   there's not just one big bucket for everything right retirement HSAs 529s just give everyone
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.140]   a big it should be like a speed limit everyone follows the same limit I don't know why that
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.320]   for some whatever reason someone's working on that someone's working on that a portable
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.980]   retirement plan that attaches I think to you like your social security number but so what
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.500]   what what other options do we have here because he's he's saying listen it's fifteen five
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:31.980]   hundred I think the 401k is twenty two five now is that about right for yeah yeah so the
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.540]   max the max in the simple is fifteen five you get a three percent employer match plus
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.660]   a catch-up contribution of thirty five hundred bucks if he's over 50 I'm assuming he's he's
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:46.980]   not because of the limit what's the simple part why is it called simple it's an acronym
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.660]   and and and really it kind of ties into the name it's supposed to be simple and easy to
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.620]   set up which is why they were at one point popular but basically so so look I mean he
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.100]   could his alternatives are that I mean a small company there's pros and cons to being at
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.260]   a small company pros and cons of being at a large corporation that would offer a 401k
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.980]   but maybe he can be vocal about it in in bring up you know hey should we review this should
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.740]   we look at other options you know should we look at 401ks but he can also save into an
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:17.340]   IRA at the same time he may not be aware of that he can max out a traditional or Roth
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.020]   IRA to sixty five hundred to seventy five hundred so it still doesn't really you know
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.580]   shake a stick at a 401k and the benefits of having those those three buckets usually of
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:33.180]   a pre-tax Roth and after-tax account but to answer his question you know why do they why
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.380]   do small businesses have them is because they're small and they might be you know cash constrained
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.820]   time constrained they might have you know ten or twenty employees and so they don't
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.020]   want to go with a full-blown 401k plan cost-effective maybe yeah but the thinking is about is a
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:52.420]   bit outdated look simple IRAs did you kind of they suck to be honest 401ks are superior
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:58.020]   in every way and now they've caught up to where the costs are it's more affordable and
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.860]   you can work with someone to take care of all the paperwork and you can have a TPA involved
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.340]   and there's more flexibility around them and whatnot but it's a lot easier to with a company
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.940]   like Betterment or something for a small business that you could do it now it would be a lot
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:16.420]   easier the other thing is if he has any other form of income outside of his employer he
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.540]   could do a SEP IRA right if he has some other income the other thing so Nick my Julie member
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.440]   Duncan on this show said why you shouldn't max out your 401k and he said if you put your
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.500]   money into index funds and buy and hold and don't make a lot of moves that are gonna cause
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.340]   taxes that you can end up pretty close to the same place so I guess a brokerage account
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.540]   is probably an option here too as long as he's not trading his face off right exactly
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.600]   yeah he could throw it in some ETFs and it you know it's not as tax advantage of course
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:48.340]   but it's it's better than nothing yeah simple simple IRAs are kind of like DVD players no
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.500]   one really has much use for them unless you're Michael Batnick I guess but they're a bit
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:59.300]   outdated 401ks are much easier to set up easier to get going and the problem is a lot of these
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.780]   I'm sure a lot of this stuff was was set up like with good intentions at the time and
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.260]   now that it's just we have all these different programs and plans and it would be nice we
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.260]   could simplify it but the unfortunately the tax code and the government doesn't really
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:16.120]   work like that so there is another one case are just too too complex and expensive for
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.060]   small employers basically is that what it comes down to they were there really not anymore
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.300]   it's just kind of an outdated it's an outdated piece maybe they initially sought out a 401k
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.020]   and they were advised to use a simple IRA but things have changed but there is a change
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.860]   talk to the HR people about this for sure yeah I would bring it up I think it's worthwhile
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.020]   and I don't think he's really overstepping just to ask a question you know just to look
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.460]   at other options but the there is a new update thanks to Daniel Rosa he runs all of our corporate
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:46.500]   retirement plans so we do small business 401ks and such here the secure act 2.0 now allows
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.220]   for a Roth option within his simple IRA plan so I can't fix the contribution limit but
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.700]   at least you know now you're aware of those other two options of the Roth and the additional
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.460]   Roth IRA contribution that you can make so Dave in the chat says simple stands for savings
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.060]   incentive matching plan for employees all right I feel like that's kind of a stretch
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.820]   they just wanted it to be simple and they just came up with words that match but nothing
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:14.860]   like using simple as an acronym for something that doesn't sound simple yes all right next
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:20.860]   week Duncan is off he will be traveling throughout Germany drinking liter beers and eating wiener
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.420]   schnitzel you know hopefully in a meter hosen but yeah okay that's just true I got sick
