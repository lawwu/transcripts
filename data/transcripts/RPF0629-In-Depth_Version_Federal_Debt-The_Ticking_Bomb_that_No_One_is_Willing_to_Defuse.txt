[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.280]   "The federal deficit ballooned at start of new fiscal year up 77% from a year before. The federal budget deficit ballooned rapidly in the first four months of the fiscal year amid falling tax revenue and higher spending," the Treasury Department said Tuesday, posing a new challenge for the White House and Congress as they prepare for a number of budget battles. "The deficit grew 77% in the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period one year before," Treasury said. "The total deficit for the four-month period is now at a total of $1.5 trillion. The federal budget deficit ballooned at start of new fiscal year up 77% from a year before."
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.300]  Ï€ÎµÎ¹: "It's big tax cuts combined with big increases in spending when they already had big deficits," said former Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad, Democrat from North Dakota. "So guess what? It's craziness." "When Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives during the Obama administration, lawmakers and White House officials embarked on a number of strained negotiations to try and get the budget out of the way. They were not able to get the budget out of the way, but they were able to get the budget out of the way. It was a huge success."

[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   spending meanwhile increased 9% over the same period
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.020]   the biggest increases were for defense military programs which saw a 12% increase
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.220]   and Medicare which saw a 16% increase

Under this proposal equal to 0.2% of GDP. Raising the Social Security and Medicare payroll tax by one percentage point each is recommended for two reasons. First, as stated above, the Social Security and Medicare systems face a combined $100 trillion cash deficit over 30 years. So it makes sense to concentrate budget savings in those two systems.

[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:42.700]   the blueprint proposes adding a one percentage point tax to income above that level so that the new tax remains proportional. Those who would prefer that all new taxes come from upper income taxpayers should note that these taxpayers would already bear nearly the entire cost of 3% of GDP in Social Security and Medicare reforms, as well as most of the cost of scaling back the employer health exclusion. Replaceing the tax on the new tax is a good idea, but it's also a good idea to have a new tax that's more than enough to cover the cost of the new tax.

[02:04:52.120 --> 02:05:19.960]   of this progressivist utopia and expect it not to be painful. It's gonna stink. It's gonna be painful. I forget why I started that rant. Just simply that we're going to pay for our sins. You always pay for sins. You cannot steal and then create a whole class of voters whose entire political ideas are not about the political ideas of the people.
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:47.940]   against the people that don't deserve it and who has nothing related to their own virtue. Everybody wants to steal from everyone else. Well, that doesn't work. I thank God he set up a system in which morality and virtue rule. Now, you can reject that all day long, but when you build an empire based on theft, at some point in time, that empire will come crashing down. It will. That's what we're going to see, in my opinion.
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.800]   So, the point is,
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:06:18.760]   I see zero political solutions. I feel like these problems are comprehensive. Although I concede that it's possible that solutions could happen, I don't see the necessary preconditions for those solutions for all the reasons previously discussed. No virtuous electorate, no knowledgeable electorate, no virtuous politicians, a system that rewards crony capitalism, theft, corruption, rather than virtue.
