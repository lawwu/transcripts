[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.420]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.740]   Today on the show, we continue our discussion
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.900]   of federal debt, and let me lay out everything
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.300]   we're gonna cover in the show up front
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.400]   so that you can decide if this particular episode
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.780]   of the show will make a good use of your time or not.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.640]   Today's show will not feature much personal commentary.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.020]   In yesterday's show, I did add some personal commentary
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.480]   and discussion onto the topic of the ticking time bomb
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.320]   that is US federal debt.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.160]   Today's show, however, will feature very minimal commentary.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   If you are a reader, one who prefers to absorb information
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.200]   in written form, and/or if you find that reading
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.400]   is a more productive use of your time than listening,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.640]   then all you need to do is simply reference
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.340]   the two sources cited in the show notes for today's show,
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.680]   specifically a Washington Post article
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.080]   from March 5 called "The Federal Deficit Ballooned
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.280]   "at the Start of a New Fiscal Year,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.380]   "Up 77% from the Year Before."
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.320]   I will read you some excerpts of that article,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.160]   and in addition, you can reference the written report
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.600]   that I will be reading to you
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.320]   called "A Comprehensive Federal Budget Plan
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.860]   "to Avert a Debt Crisis" by Brian Riedel.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.440]   That is the report that was referenced in yesterday's show.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.860]   So if you're one who reads, go ahead
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.900]   and just use those written resources
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.380]   to help you make good use of your time
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.440]   and skip the show.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.740]   If you're one who benefits from podcasts such as mine
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.120]   to turn otherwise unproductive time
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.460]   into something productive, then I think you'll enjoy this
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.260]   because I'll give you an audio version
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.560]   that is fairly balanced and useful,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.260]   and the commentary will just help you
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.500]   to make good use of some of your audio listening time
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.300]   rather than going and reading these particular resources.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.240]   But it won't offend me if you skip this show,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.700]   so because of your preference to read.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   Specifically, what I'm seeking to do at this point
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.040]   is after yesterday's show where I talked about the idea,
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.340]   talked about my concerns, I used the metaphor of the fact
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.280]   that the federal deficit is metaphorically
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.920]   a crack in a bridge, and the engineers can look at it
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.960]   and say, "There's a crack here.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.020]   "This bridge is going to fail,
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.980]   "but we don't know when the bridge is gonna fail.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.260]   "We don't know to what level
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.720]   "that catastrophic failure might actually look like.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.760]   "We don't know if that just means
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.820]   "a little bit is gonna fall off
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.340]   "or the whole thing's gonna crumble."
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.500]   These are all things that are unknown.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.900]   Predicting the future is generally a difficult business,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.980]   and so we're all in that situation.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.100]   But one of the groups of thinkers that I wish to reach
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.860]   is those who are more in the middle,
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.940]   those who, perhaps like me, are people who say,
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.680]   "Well, I don't wanna be an extremist.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.780]   "I don't wanna be an alarmist.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.580]   "I don't wanna all of a sudden
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.720]   "move into radical alarm territory,
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.760]   "but I do want an honest discussion of the facts.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.300]   "I don't particularly want it
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.780]   "from a strong partisan perspective.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.160]   "I'm not looking for a certain right-wing
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.080]   "or left-wing approach.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.380]   "I want a discussion, an honest analysis
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.900]   "of different discussions
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900]   "so that I can think things through."
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.500]   And then that way, with that data and with that information,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.700]   I can just follow my own observations.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.940]   I can try to look at the world,
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.420]   and as the years go by, tick by in the coming years,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.700]   I can start to get a guess
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.300]   on what I think is gonna happen.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.380]   So if that's you, then this will be useful for you.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.260]   Now, I was amused to find
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.580]   that after I recorded yesterday's show,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.980]   I quickly, almost right after I had,
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.180]   a few hours after I'd finished it,
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.060]   I saw this Washington Post article,
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.460]   and I thought it was ironic.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.300]   I wish it had come out before I recorded the audio,
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.140]   but it didn't.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.780]   But let me read you some excerpts from it.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.100]   This is Washington Post, Dateline, March 5, at 6:51 p.m.,
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.100]   from the business section.

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.840]   and predicted that the deficit to GDP ratio
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   will come down with growth.

[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.800]   "Some in that wing argue the debt is less pressing
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.360]   "than other social maladies,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.560]   "such as poverty or inadequate health coverage,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.160]   "while others argue the debt
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.760]   "is of little consequence at all.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.800]   "Instead of trying to resolve their differences,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.360]   "the White House and some Democrats
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.880]   "are seeking to make the 2020 elections
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.360]   "a referendum on economic policy,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.320]   "suggesting neither side is looking
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.200]   "to reach a compromise in the coming months."
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.120]   Dropping down again in the story,
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.340]   the quote continuing to read,
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.640]   "The US economy is still the strongest in the world,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.200]   "and investors have retained a healthy appetite
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.840]   "for US government debt,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.240]   "because the country has never defaulted
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.860]   "on its obligations.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.960]   "But large debt levels have caused financial crises
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.720]   "in a number of other countries,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.020]   "and forced major economic changes
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.660]   "that have led to recessions,
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.660]   "a phenomenon that some have warned
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.200]   "could happen in the United States
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.960]   "if steps aren't taken."
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.560]   Senator James Lankford, Republican from Oklahoma,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.360]   was bemoaning debt levels Tuesday,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.280]   a few hours before Treasury reported
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.980]   the big increase in the deficit.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.260]   Quote, "If you take 22 trillion miles, total distance,
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.300]   "you would fly from Earth to Pluto
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.160]   "and back 3,081 times,"
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.920]   Lankford said on the Senate floor.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.800]   "This is a heavy debt."
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.760]   Now, the key thing I wanna draw your attention to
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.480]   is the political dynamics,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.860]   and this is why I personally don't see a solution
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.500]   that will happen in the future.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.600]   All of these news stories,
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.640]   and have been for the past few decades,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.760]   are basically, well, at some point, something will happen.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.880]   At some point, something will happen.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.460]   At some point, something will happen.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.380]   Meanwhile, the numbers just simply continue to grow.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.280]   Now, it's possible that at some point,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   something will happen,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.520]   but if something doesn't happen soon, it's too late.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.000]   Now, I personally am convinced it's already too late,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.580]   but I'll be watching very carefully in the next few years
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.280]   to see if, in fact,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.480]   some kind of discussion starts to happen,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.360]   if, in fact, there is a way for Republicans and Democrats
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.700]   in the United States to come together,
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.920]   have intelligent adult conversations,
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.440]   and start to change spending, start to change deficits,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.840]   start to change the debt, and it has to happen.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.760]   The problem is, in the moment,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.280]   the discussions that happen are completely immaterial.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.640]   In order for you to change the structure,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   you have to attack Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.200]   and then also defense spending,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.760]   and those are considered to be sacrosanct
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.880]   by many of the people who are involved
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.300]   in these various programs.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.440]   So how do you change those things?
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.760]   Well, I don't see how it could be possible,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.240]   especially in the political environment we are in.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.760]   There are many calls by many people
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.320]   for civility or conversation, et cetera.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.200]   I don't see how, in the US-American political fabric,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.360]   I don't see how that those conversations
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.240]   or discussions are possible.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   Everyone is basically doubling down on partisanship,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.680]   and I just don't see it.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.020]   I don't see how it could happen.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.520]   And I have lost any confidence that there is a willingness
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.960]   or even an ability on behalf of a broad swath
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.180]   of the US citizenry for people to stop
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.240]   and to think rationally and discuss things
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.060]   and to vote against their own self-interest.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.960]   Nobody is going to vote against their own self-interest.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.400]   So that's my perspective.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.100]   So watch stories like this as they go on,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.080]   and here's what I would encourage you to look for
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.480]   in the next coming years
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.000]   as you look at stories like this.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.780]   First, you will always hear discussions say,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.820]   I'll always hear this optimistic idea that,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.780]   well, at some point we need to have a solution.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.820]   At some point there needs to be a conversation.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.540]   I'm convinced it's too late,
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.020]   but I hope to be wrong on that particular thing.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.160]   But study the data, which we'll get into in a moment,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.980]   and see if anything could actually possibly be done.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.280]   Secondly, look for all of these,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.940]   for lack of a better word, tropes,
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.540]   and you'll see that basically people aren't serious.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.660]   You can't, I love tax cuts.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.700]   I think it's great.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.780]   I think there'll be some reinvigoration of business
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.800]   happening in the United States,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.160]   but tax cuts because of the lowering tax levels.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.420]   We haven't talked extensively
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.460]   about the Tax Cut and Jobs Act here on the show,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.060]   but it should make some difference.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.420]   But you cannot make up for in tax cuts
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.260]   what is happening with the baby boomers retiring
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.980]   and the heavy pressure on Medicare.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.740]   You cannot make up for in tax cuts
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   what declining birth rates are,
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.100]   the problem that declining birth rates
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   are bringing to the country.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.940]   You cannot make up for in tax cuts
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.740]   what stagnant and decreasing wages are happening, et cetera.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.060]   So you can't, it's not that one or the other,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.220]   but everyone says, "Well, the tax cut's
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.180]   "gonna solve everything," or just expand spending,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.020]   and these are foolish perspectives.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.420]   So at some point in time, the bills are not gonna get paid,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.600]   and the bills are not gonna get paid in many, many forms.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.380]   We don't know what form, which is the problem,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.100]   which is why we need to be prepared for many forms.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.900]   Now, at this point, I'm gonna discuss here
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.340]   this paper that I referenced in yesterday's show,
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.220]   and I'm gonna be reading extensive portions
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.460]   of this paper to you, again,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.460]   to try to make good use of your audio time.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.580]   But the paper is titled,
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.440]   "A Comprehensive Federal Budget Plan
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.340]   "to Avert a Debt Crisis," by Brian Riedel,
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.800]   who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.140]   From his bio here, Brian Riedel is a senior fellow
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.140]   at the Manhattan Institute and a member of MI's Economics 21
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.740]   focusing on budget, tax, and economic policy.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.540]   Previously, he worked for six years as chief economist
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.260]   to Senator Rob Portman, Republican from Ohio,
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.580]   and as staff director of the Senate Finance Subcommittee
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.140]   on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.140]   He also served as a director of budget and spending policy
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.580]   for Marco Rubio's presidential campaign,
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.140]   and was the lead architect
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.200]   of the 10-year deficit reduction plan
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.140]   During the years 2001 to 2011,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.060]   Riedel served as the Heritage Foundation's
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.360]   lead research fellow on federal budget and spending policy.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.340]   Skipping some of the other references,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.980]   Riedel holds a bachelor's degree in economics
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.020]   and political science from the University of Wisconsin
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.400]   and a master's degree in public affairs
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.380]   from Princeton University.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.620]   So this report was from September 2018,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.260]   about six months ago at the time of this recording.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.860]   And I think it's quite useful to have
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.160]   that six-month context.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.260]   I'm glad I'm doing this now
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.980]   instead of right when it came out,
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.800]   because now we can think about what's happening
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.220]   in the last six months.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.660]   Riedel, of course, from his biography
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.180]   would tend to be more on the conservative direction
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.100]   of the political spectrum,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.300]   I'm assuming from the institutions that he has represented
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.180]   and the politicians for whom he has worked.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.420]   But I think you'll assess his work here
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   as fairly well-balanced in the actual report.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.620]   Let's get right into it.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.620]   Executive summary.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.500]   Annual budget deficits are projected
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.140]   to soon surpass $1 trillion,
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.020]   on their way to $2 trillion,
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.140]   or even $3 trillion in 10 to 15 years.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.360]   Social Security and Medicare
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.520]   face a combined $100 trillion cash deficit
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.440]   over the next 30 years,
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.320]   which would push the national debt
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.800]   to nearly 200% of the gross domestic product, GDP.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.960]   At that point, interest on that debt
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   would consume 40% of all tax revenues,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.720]   or more if interest rates rise.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.800]   Unless reforms are enacted,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.900]   global markets will, at some point,
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.720]   stop lending to the United States
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.840]   at plausible interest rates.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.340]   When that event occurs, or even approaches,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.020]   interest rates will soar,
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.000]   and the federal government
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.160]   will not be able to pay its bills
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.720]   with dire consequences for the US economy.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.280]   A debt crisis, in short, looms on the horizon.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.560]   There is a way to avert this debt crisis.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.680]   However, lawmakers must act quickly
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.480]   to reform Social Security and Medicare,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.060]   as every year, four million more baby boomers
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.360]   retire into those programs,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.440]   and the eventual cost of reform
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.360]   rises by trillions of dollars.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.080]   This report presents a specific 30-year blueprint,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.600]   each element of which is scored
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.880]   using data from the Congressional Budget Office, CBO,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   to stabilize the national debt at 95% of GDP.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.440]   The fiscal consolidation in this report
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.360]   calls for some Social Security and Medicare benefits
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.640]   for upper-income recipients to be trimmed.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.480]   Some taxes would rise,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.720]   spending on defense would continue to fall
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.360]   as a share of the economy,
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.960]   but anti-poverty reforms would be limited
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.320]   to a slight reduction in the growth of Medicaid benefits,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.640]   and domestic discretionary spending priorities
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.620]   would be largely protected.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.760]   Without reform, runaway deficits
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   will all but guarantee a debt crisis
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.640]   that will profoundly damage
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.520]   the country's economic and social order.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.840]   There is still time to avoid that crisis,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.440]   but it will require the nation's
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.360]   fractious political leaders
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.780]   to leave their respective comfort zones and compromise.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.040]   Thus ends the executive summary.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.160]   Now, again, I want to emphasize,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.160]   your and my job is to consume arguments such as these,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.120]   such as this one, assess them,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.080]   and then watch to see if the necessary preconditions
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.720]   are happening in the coming years.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.520]   So, for example, I repeat,
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.120]   this is a summary of the executive summary.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.200]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.360]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.440]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.360]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.400]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.520]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.560]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.600]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.760]   It's a summary of the executive summary
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.880]   of the United States Constitution.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.760]   Now, if you watch election cycles in the United States,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.920]   watch what is happening with the proposals.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.000]   Let's see what happens with the 2020
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.920]   presidential and congressional elections.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.760]   Let's see what happens, who's elected president.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   Let's see what happens with the majorities
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.520]   in the House and Senate,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.040]   and let's watch over the next few years,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.800]   and that will give us some idea
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   of whether or not this kind of political compromise
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.360]   and serious reform is possible.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.160]   We can hope, 'cause none of us wanna go through a crisis,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.680]   but I've stated it clearly,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.880]   I see no path how that happens,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.680]   but I hope that I'm wrong.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.520]   Let's discuss the actual data in this report now.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.100]   A comprehensive federal budget plan
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.960]   to avert a debt crisis, introduction.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   Annual budget deficits are projected
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.000]   to soon surpass $1 trillion,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.680]   on their way to $2 trillion,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   or even $3 trillion in 10 to 15 years.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.480]   Social Security and Medicare face
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.960]   a combined $100 trillion cash deficit
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.600]   over the next 30 years,
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.360]   which is projected to bring a $100 trillion national debt.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.720]   At that point, interest on that debt
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.960]   would consume 40% of all tax revenues,
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   or more, if interest rates rise.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.600]   Unless reforms are enacted,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.040]   global markets will, at some point,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.640]   stop lending to the United States
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.600]   at plausible interest rates.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.400]   When that event occurs, or even approaches,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.040]   interest rates will soar,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.560]   and the federal government will not be able
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.680]   to pay its bills with dire consequences
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.360]   for the US economy.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.440]   A debt crisis, in short, looms on the horizon.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.520]   Yet most lawmakers tasked with the responsibility
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.040]   of averting it, express little interest in doing so.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.280]   No recent president has presented a specific plan
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.720]   to stabilize the long-term budget.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.960]   Congress recently enacted tax cuts
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.800]   and discretionary spending increases that,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.460]   irrespective of any policy merits,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.440]   will add trillions in debt.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.400]   Lawmakers promised cheering crowds
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.840]   that they will never trim Social Security or Medicare,
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   or accept a penny in new tax increases or defense cuts.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.160]   Democratic socialists pledged
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.460]   to further increase federal spending
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.320]   by $42 trillion over the decade,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.280]   and $218 trillion over 30 years.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.680]   Federal spending rises by $150 billion annually,
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.440]   while bipartisan resistance greeted a proposal
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.680]   this summer to merely rescind a few billion dollars
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.520]   in spending authority that was not going to be spent anyway.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.880]   Petty squabbles over petty spending cuts,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.560]   and the refusal even to discuss the main drivers of debt,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.680]   reflect a general unwillingness of Congress,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.440]   the White House, and indeed the citizenry,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.360]   to face the unsustainability
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.920]   of Washington's current fiscal path.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.140]   There is a way to avert this debt crisis
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.960]   without major tax increases,
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.920]   or significant cuts to anti-poverty and social spending.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.240]   However, lawmakers must act quickly
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.960]   to reform Social Security and Medicare,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.600]   as every year, four million more baby boomers
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.560]   retire into those programs,
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.160]   and the eventual cost of reform rises by trillions of dollars.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   This report presents a specific 30-year blueprint,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.720]   each element of which is scored
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.960]   using the most recent Congressional Budget Office
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.840]   long-term budget outlook,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.120]   to stabilize the national debt
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.760]   at 95% of the gross domestic product, GDP.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.200]   Section one identifies the drivers of the long-term debt.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.160]   Section two addresses false, easy solutions
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.240]   deployed to avoid real reform.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.200]   Section three presents the blueprint.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.080]   Section four defends the blueprint
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.480]   against both conservative and liberal objections.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.680]   The fiscal consolidation in this report
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.200]   calls for some Social Security and Medicare benefits
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   for upper-income recipients to be trimmed.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   Some taxes would rise.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.720]   Spending on defense would continue to fall
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.600]   as a share of the economy.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.880]   In short, there is something in this blueprint
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.920]   for everyone to oppose,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.720]   but letting the country wander into a debt crisis
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.200]   is even worse.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.520]   To be sure, deficit reduction proposals are common.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.480]   The problem is that most congressional budget proposals
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   simply assume generic and unrealistic
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.040]   long-term spending and tax targets
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.640]   without spelling out the specific programmatic reforms
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.240]   that could meet those targets.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.800]   Across the policy community,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.440]   long-term budget proposals often reflect
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.400]   liberal or conservative dream scenarios
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   rather than plans that can appeal to both parties.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.960]   By contrast, the blueprint presented here is specific,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.800]   scored, and represents politically realistic solutions
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.560]   rather than partisan fantasies.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.920]   It is intended to revive a serious bipartisan discussion
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.240]   and negotiations.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.300]   Section one, why the debt is soaring.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.240]   From the mid-1950s through 2008,
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   the national debt held by the public averaged 35% of GDP.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.560]   This level of borrowing could easily be absorbed
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.840]   by the increasingly global financial markets,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.080]   and it resulted in interest costs
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.480]   averaging 2% of GDP,
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.260]   roughly 10% of a typical federal budget.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.960]   Since 2008, the Great Recession
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.360]   and the beginning of the baby boomer retirements
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   have more than doubled the debt to 78% of GDP.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.620]   If current policies continue,
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.620]   the debt is projected to reach an unprecedented 194% of GDP
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.040]   within 30 years.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.640]   And if this debt brings higher interest rates,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.720]   as consensus economic theory suggests,
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   the debt could surpass 250% of GDP.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.120]   And servicing the debt could cost 7.5% of GDP,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   the equivalent of $1.5 trillion in today's economy.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.800]   Americans of all incomes
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.920]   would face unprecedented tax increases,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.280]   higher interest rates for home mortgages
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.760]   and car, student, and business loans,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.800]   and a significant economic slowdown.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.320]   Unlike Greece's, the US debt would be too large
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.140]   to be easily absorbed by the global economy.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.780]   What is causing the debt rise?
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.880]   Not inadequate tax revenues,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.560]   which since the early 1950s have usually remained
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.920]   between 16.5% and 18.5% of GDP,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.720]   regardless of tax policies,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.940]   and which are projected to rise above historical norms
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.120]   to 18.6% to 19.8% of GDP,
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.440]   depending on the fate of various expiring tax cuts
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   and delayed tax increases.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.380]   Nor is it driven on the spending side
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.320]   by aggregate expenditures for discretionary
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.800]   and smaller entitlement programs,
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.640]   which are projected to continue falling
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.900]   as a share of the economy.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.560]   Figure two shows that the entire increase in long-term debt
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.040]   will come from surging social security,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.760]   Medicare, and other government healthcare spending.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.900]   According to the CBO,
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.900]   these costs have risen from 7% to 10% of GDP since 2000,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:29.520]   and are projected to reach 15.5% of GDP by 2048,
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.360]   or 21.8% of GDP when the interest costs
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.400]   of Social Security and Medicare's annual deficits
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.360]   are included.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.240]   Why Social Security and Medicare are going bankrupt.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.920]   Between 2008 and 2030,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   74 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964,
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.120]   on average 10,000 per day,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.000]   will retire and receive Social Security
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.840]   and Medicare benefits.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.880]   Of this group, those retiring at age 66
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.460]   and living to age 90 will spend one third
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.660]   of their adult life receiving federal retirement benefits.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.380]   The combination of more retiring baby boomers
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.020]   and longer lifespans will expand Social Security
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.780]   and Medicare caseloads far beyond
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.020]   what current taxpayers can afford
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.580]   under current benefit formulas.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.780]   In 1960, five workers paid the taxes
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.700]   to support each retiree,
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.820]   and of course, Medicare did not exist.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.020]   The ratio of workers to retirees
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.860]   has now fallen below three to one
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.420]   on its way to two to one by the 2030s.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.220]   When today's kindergartners are adults,
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.560]   each married couple will basically be responsible
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.540]   for the Social Security and healthcare
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.720]   of their very own retiree.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.180]   These demographic challenges are worsened
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.620]   by rising healthcare costs
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.820]   and repeated benefit expansions enacted by lawmakers.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.860]   Today's typical retiring couple
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.220]   has paid $140,000 into Medicare
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.500]   and will receive $420,000 in benefits
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.020]   in net present value,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.420]   in part because Medicare's physician and drug benefits
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.300]   are not pre-funded with payroll taxes
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.720]   and only partially funded by retiree premiums.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.600]   Most Social Security recipients also come out ahead.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.800]   Thus, most seniors' benefits
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.740]   greatly exceed their lifetime contributions
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.820]   to the Social Security and Medicare systems.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.560]   By 2030, the 74 million baby boomers
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.260]   will have joined a retirement benefit system
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.880]   that runs a substantial per person deficit.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.420]   According to CBO, between 2018 and 2048,
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.420]   Medicare is projected to run a $41 trillion cash deficit.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.140]   Social Security will run an $18 trillion cash deficit,
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.740]   and the interest on the resulting program debt
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.580]   will be $41 trillion.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.260]   To adjust these 30-year totals for inflation,
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.980]   trim by one third.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   Rather than adequately self-finance
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.360]   through payroll taxes and premiums,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.100]   these two programs are set to add $100 trillion
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.640]   to the national debt.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.740]   The rest of the federal budget is projected
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.020]   to run a surplus over the next 30 years.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.100]   Figure four expresses the same projections
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.340]   in a different manner.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.240]   By 2048, Social Security and Medicare
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.500]   will collect 5.9% of GDP in dedicated revenues,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.300]   and spend 12.2% of GDP in benefits,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.100]   plus 6.3% of GDP in interest costs
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.260]   resulting from these two programs' deficits.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.100]   That 12.6% of GDP budget deficit
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.260]   resulting solely from Social Security and Medicare
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.020]   is unsustainable.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:05.760]   The fiscal winter is coming, and autumn has already arrived.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.600]   Since 2008, when the first baby boomers
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.060]   qualified for early retirement,
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.160]   Social Security and Medicare have accounted for 60%
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.940]   of all inflation-adjusted federal spending growth,
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.300]   with Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.680]   responsible for an additional 31%.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.220]   The majority of budgetary savings
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.060]   achieved by discretionary spending caps,
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.140]   defense cuts, and rising tax revenues
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.000]   have simply financed growing Social Security
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.540]   and Medicare costs,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.920]   which will grow by another $130 billion annually
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.700]   over the next decade.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.560]   That is the equivalent of creating
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.460]   another Defense Department every five years.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.580]   This will happen automatically,
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.660]   without any congressional votes,
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.180]   and therefore likely with scant media coverage.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.900]   And as federal resources further shift to the elderly,
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.100]   Washington is beginning to run out
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.420]   of offsetting spending cuts.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.420]   This has contributed to the deficit
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.420]   expanding from $438 billion to $666 billion
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.940]   over the past two years.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.260]   CBO's current policy baseline shows deficits rising
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.820]   to $2 trillion within a decade,
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.260]   or $3 trillion if interest rates
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.580]   return to historical norms.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.020]   Unlike the temporary, recession-driven budget deficits
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.020]   a decade ago, these Social Security
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:41.020]   and Medicare-based deficits will expand permanently.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.220]   Over the next 30 years, CBO projects
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.180]   that the national debt will grow
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.620]   from $20 trillion to $99 trillion,
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.220]   $54 trillion after inflation,
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.980]   or much higher if interest rates rise
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.620]   from the projected 3% to 4% range
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.620]   to the historically typical 5% to 6%.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.380]   President Trump's latest budget proposal
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.940]   shows the impossibility of reining in deficits
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.880]   without Social Security and Medicare reform.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.220]   By allowing these programs to nearly double
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.220]   over the decade, from $1.6 trillion to $3 trillion,
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.380]   the White House is forced to propose
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.500]   slashing other entitlement spending
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.220]   as a share of GDP by 1/5 over the decade,
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.900]   and cutting both defense
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.780]   and domestic discretionary spending to levels
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.780]   as a percentage of GDP unseen since the 1930s.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.860]   Yet even if these implausible cuts were enacted,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.060]   CBO still estimates a budget deficit
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.940]   topping $1 trillion by 2028.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.540]   This deficit would continue escalating thereafter
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.460]   because Social Security and Medicare costs
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.620]   would continue growing even after Washington
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.100]   would have run out of other spending to cut.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.340]   Predictably, most of the popular blame
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.500]   for the rising deficits is currently pinned
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.500]   on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.740]   TCJA will likely decrease revenues
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.280]   by roughly 1% of GDP indefinitely
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.260]   if extended past 2025, when parts of the law
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.820]   are currently scheduled to expire.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.060]   This does not include additional tax revenues
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.060]   that will arise from the economic growth
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.300]   that lower tax rates will induce.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.420]   The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.700]   estimates that these additional tax revenues
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.500]   would offset the additional interest costs
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   of the tax law, though not the primary deficit
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   increasing impact of the tax cuts themselves.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.660]   While the government revenues foregone by TCJA
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.860]   will surely worsen deficits,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.180]   they are a much smaller contributor
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.860]   than Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.140]   spending on which will together rise
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.140]   by 2.6% of GDP over the decade
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.260]   and 5.4% over 30 years.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.540]   Even without the 2017 tax cuts,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.060]   the annual deficit would still exceed
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.260]   $1.7 trillion within a decade.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.940]   In short, TCJA did not create
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.040]   the federal government's large deficits,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.360]   and even repealing them would not absolve lawmakers
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.500]   of the need to address rising entitlement spending.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.900]   How a crisis may play out.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.180]   The national debt's share of the economy
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.300]   cannot rise forever.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.940]   At a certain point, even large global savings markets
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.820]   will be stretched, and investor confidence
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.720]   in America's ability to finance its debt will evaporate.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.380]   The timing of a country's debt crisis
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.140]   depends as much on market psychology
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.660]   as on economic fundamentals.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.220]   But eventually, as the debt steeply escalates,
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.540]   investors will move from unease to panic
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.380]   and demand higher interest rates
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.420]   to finance the federal government.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.240]   These higher rates will make it extremely difficult
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.940]   for businesses to borrow and invest,
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.380]   and will make auto loans, student loans,
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.600]   and home mortgages less affordable,
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.300]   while also forcing unprecedented tax increases
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.980]   and/or spending cuts to pay
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.940]   for Washington's higher interest costs.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.820]   Such an outcome is highly likely
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.220]   if annual deficits continue growing past 10% of GDP,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:34.020]   and the debt continues to approach 200% of GDP
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.720]   as projected in the current policy baseline.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.800]   On the one hand, America will have some leeway
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.580]   due to its reputation as a safe harbor for investments
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.060]   and status as the world's reserve currency.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.020]   On the other hand, absorbing a debt
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.600]   of nearly 200% of America's economy
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.380]   would be much more expensive for the global markets
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.520]   than absorbing, say, 200% of a smaller GDP,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.200]   like that of Greece.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.160]   In the absence of fundamental reform,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.420]   the more likely scenario is a series
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.120]   of minor investor panics, forcing up interest rates,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.380]   followed by upper income tax increases,
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.260]   and lower priority spending reductions
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.260]   that are insufficient to finance
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.360]   the rising entitlement and interest costs.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.240]   Eventually, Washington will run out of such offsets
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.660]   to reduce deficits, leaving only the choice
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.180]   between historically large middle-class tax increases
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.260]   and a drastic reduction in Social Security
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.740]   and Medicare benefits for current retirees.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.700]   Now, I wanna pause for a moment to insert
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.180]   just a couple words of commentary
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.980]   before we move on to section two.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.140]   You will notice here that this particular author
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.760]   omits a discussion of inflation.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.640]   Inflation, he only uses, he only discusses inflation
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.860]   in terms of standard economic forecasting,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.160]   the type of inflation that we are all accustomed to,
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.580]   which, by the way, is absolutely devastating.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.940]   And every time I run numbers on this,
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.260]   I absolutely find it devastating.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.380]   In my newest course, I have a whole section
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.940]   on current capital controls,
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.860]   capital controls and currency controls
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.180]   under which we currently all live,
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.500]   because one of the biggest dangers of an economic crisis
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.140]   is capital controls, and especially currency controls
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.300]   for us as individuals.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.860]   And so I have a whole discussion on capital controls
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.340]   under which we currently live.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.520]   And in analyzing those capital controls,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.380]   I calculated the impact of them
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.340]   on an inflation-adjusted basis,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.740]   and they are absolutely devastating.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.580]   And I hate inflation.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.700]   Anyway, the point is, this author is using
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.840]   just the standard economic forecasting models
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.140]   of built-in normal inflation rates of two, 3%,
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.180]   that type of thing.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.780]   Nowhere in this particular paper
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.340]   does he ever address mass inflation,
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.340]   and nowhere does he ever address hyperinflation,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.660]   with the exception of an argument
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.220]   that showing that inflation doesn't solve the problems
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.500]   of Social Security and Medicare
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.380]   because they are tied to inflation.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.640]   We'll get to that argument later.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.300]   They're inflation-adjusted.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.740]   But I do think that it's worth your,
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.400]   I wanna point that out to you,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.820]   because in addition to these problems,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.580]   which are devastating but practically,
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:26.020]   but more common, we also need to think about
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.020]   the potential of mass inflation and/or hyperinflation,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.620]   because that's even more devastating.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.620]   Now, I think there are strong arguments
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.980]   that would indicate why the United States
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.020]   might seek to avoid those policies,
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.160]   why the US Federal Reserve would avoid that policy.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.900]   I think there are strong arguments for it.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.480]   But I do think it's plausible.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.940]   In the past years in studying it,
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.080]   I used to think of hyperinflation
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.740]   in the United States as implausible.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.080]   I used to think of mass inflation as plausible.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.880]   I have since moved mass inflation
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.560]   in my own mental categorization
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.840]   from plausible to increasingly probable,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.920]   and hyperinflation from implausible to plausible.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.480]   Now, I don't know what will happen
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.640]   the coming years will tell us a lot,
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.200]   but we need to watch that.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.240]   I just wanna point out that absence to you.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.840]   When talking about how a crisis will play out,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.280]   this particular author doesn't use
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.840]   or doesn't factor in the potential
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.880]   of mass inflation, hyperinflation scenarios,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.080]   the devaluation of the currency.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.560]   And this is important for you to remember,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.880]   'cause what can happen
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.000]   in order for these things to be solved?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.840]   Well, you can either have an increase in taxes,
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.760]   which is a real problem for you
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.560]   as an individual who pays taxes,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.800]   it's a real problem for me.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.720]   So that can be devastating to your personal wealth.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.840]   So we've got a plan to make sure
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.620]   that we escape those higher taxes.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.520]   Or we can have cuts in spending,
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.420]   but because those cuts in spending
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.240]   are largely devoted to the baby boomers,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.680]   we have a massive problem there
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.280]   because the baby boomers,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   yes, some of them have wealth,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.640]   but many people don't.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.560]   And so cuts in spending for Social Security and Medicare
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.920]   will be devastating for many millions of people
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.520]   for whom that's their only asset.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.720]   And they've been sold this idea
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.640]   that they can just retire
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.880]   and have these programs there for them.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.220]   And you have the largest motivated voting bloc,
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.360]   which makes the political nightmare just even worse.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.440]   And then even if those cuts are enacted,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.160]   that has a devastating impact on the economy
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.520]   with regard to spending levels and consumption levels.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520]   So that's a problem.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.120]   Or you can have more borrowing,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.760]   or you can have inflation.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.280]   Those are basically the only options
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   you just have those levers to push on.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.600]   And so for most of us, these are problems.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.800]   So if we have higher taxes,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.640]   we've got to figure out a plan
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.500]   to protect ourself from higher taxes.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.840]   If we have fewer benefits,
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.280]   we've got to have a plan to protect ourselves
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.840]   from fewer benefits.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.280]   If we have inflation, to inflate the monetary supply,
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.560]   we have to have a plan for that
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.000]   because that affects everything else.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.120]   And so it's a tough nut to crack.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.080]   That's why I wrote the whole course.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   Anyway, commentary over.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.480]   Let's move on to section two
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   called the Mirage of Easy Solutions.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.760]   Standing in the way of making the changes
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   to be outlined in this budget plan
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.480]   or other plausible proposals to avert a debt crisis
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.040]   are a series of false claims
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.840]   that the problem is easily solved.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.360]   Economic panaceas, steep economic growth.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.160]   A strong economy is necessary,
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.400]   but far from sufficient for major deficit reduction.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.280]   Growth rates will already be limited
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.120]   by the labor force slowdown
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.400]   caused by baby boomer retirement
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.640]   and declining birth rates.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.240]   That leaves productivity to drive growth.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.560]   I want to comment also,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.400]   and just insert one commentary.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.880]   The latest arguments and articles
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.240]   that I'm seeing right now
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.720]   is that the potential of declining birth rates
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   is actually, has the potential
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.640]   to be far more catastrophic in the United States
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.560]   than previously anticipated.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.960]   There has been a major decline in birth rates
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.280]   among white people,
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.440]   but it has previously been assumed
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.840]   that there would be strong,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.960]   there would be stronger birth rates
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.320]   among brown people,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.360]   primarily brown people and black people
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.640]   in the United States.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.600]   What seems to be happening, however,
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.800]   is there seems to be
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.560]   a much more significant decline in birth rates,
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.280]   not only among white people,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.000]   but especially among brown people in the United States
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.960]   than previously anticipated.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.320]   So that is something
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.400]   that you need to keep your eye on as well.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.120]   And it'll be interesting to see
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.360]   if that trend and that data continues,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.960]   or if that's just an anomaly.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.280]   I have a couple of books I need to read on it,
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.160]   but I haven't been able to dig into them yet.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.640]   But it's something that I'm paying attention to
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   to see what data starts to come in
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.240]   on the actual societal decline in birth rates.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.840]   And this could also,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.320]   additionally, another factor that has to be played into this
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.800]   is there's been a major drop in family formation
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.920]   in the United States.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.800]   So in addition, all of the previous discussions,
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.080]   and I'm not a demographer,
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.000]   so it's possible this is baked in.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.800]   But my suspicion is that with the massive decline
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.320]   in family formation in the United States,
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.040]   and with the fact that the families are formed
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.680]   are simply not stable,
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.840]   that this is going to increase even more
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.280]   to declines in birth rates.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.240]   And so I think there's basically a perfect storm
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.760]   with regard to family formation,
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.960]   with regard to children,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.760]   that is gonna possibly make these things even worse.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.360]   And I think that perfect storm is still gathering.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.120]   I think there's some indications,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.400]   and we'll see what happens in coming years with that.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   But I mean, you see it on all sides.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.640]   People kill their babies, don't have babies,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.480]   don't form families.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.560]   The families that are being formed are not stable.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.240]   Generally, it's better among the wealthy,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.800]   but family formation among middle-class and poor people
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   has been just utterly devastated.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.680]   Anyway, that's difficult.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   And I don't know how much of that is baked into this
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.920]   into these assessments here.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.800]   Let's continue on.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.200]   And I'll just repeat the discussion
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.480]   of the economic panacea of steep economic growth.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.000]   A strong economy is necessary,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.880]   but far from sufficient for major deficit reduction.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.640]   Growth rates will already be limited
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.440]   by the labor force slowdown caused
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.200]   by baby boomer retirements and declining birth rates.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.720]   That leaves productivity to drive growth.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.040]   So, no problem?
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.280]   Let's start by disregarding CBO's 2018 projection
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.160]   that total US factor productivity will continue growing
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.000]   at the 1.2% average rate of the past 30 years,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.680]   and instead assume the white hot 1.8% rate
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.720]   that prevailed from 1992 through 2005.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.480]   Most economists would consider this far too optimistic.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.200]   Nevertheless, the resulting higher incomes and tax revenues
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.800]   from this productivity jet stream would seem to close
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.480]   at least 40% of the cumulative deficits through 2048,
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.840]   until one accounts for the fact that higher incomes
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.000]   automatically result in higher social security benefits
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.640]   when the workers who earned them retire.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.160]   Much can be done to increase real economic growth rates
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.640]   above CBO's long-term 1.9% annual projections.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.680]   In particular, lawmakers should aim
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.040]   to grow the labor force participation rate,
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.640]   continue to refine the tax code to encourage work,
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.280]   savings, and investment, and improve policies
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.600]   in the areas of trade, energy, job training,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.280]   education, and healthcare.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   However, a refusal to address surging spending and deficits
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.920]   would still undermine economic growth
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.240]   by raising interest rates, decreasing business investment,
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.640]   and ultimately forcing up taxes.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.920]   Lawmakers should aspire to faster growth,
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.440]   but not simply assume it,
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.920]   especially if entitlement costs keep growing.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.140]   Inflate the debt away.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.900]   In the short term, higher inflation can dilute some
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.440]   of today's $20 trillion national debt.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.060]   However, social security and Medicare benefits
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.680]   and payments are also tied to inflation,
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.360]   so future liabilities would expand.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.480]   Additionally, Washington would have to pay
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.560]   much higher interest rates when borrowing
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.040]   to finance those benefits.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.360]   Low interest rates.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.200]   CBO's 2018 long-term budget outlook assumes
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   that the national debt can rise from 35% to 150% of GDP
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.720]   between 2007 and 2048,
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.320]   with its average interest rate peaking at just 4.4%,
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.440]   which is below even the levels of the 1990s, 6.9%,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.120]   and 2000s, 4.8%.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.040]   By contrast, the economic policy community consensus
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.020]   is that such a large increase in federal debt
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.240]   would raise interest rates.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.200]   For each percentage point that interest rates rise,
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.000]   Washington must pay approximately $13 trillion more
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.520]   in interest costs over 30 years.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.600]   That means an even higher national debt.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   Immigration.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.280]   Smart immigration policy may, on net,
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.320]   marginally improve the federal budget picture
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.640]   and the economy.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.440]   It is not a cure-all.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.340]   High-skill immigrants send higher tax revenues
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.160]   during their working careers,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.760]   but their eventual retirement into social security
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.480]   and Medicare would add new liabilities to the system.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.280]   Low-skill immigrants generally increase costs
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.520]   to the federal government,
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.820]   and especially to state and local governments,
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.280]   at least in the first or second generation,
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.120]   because the resulting education, infrastructure,
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.720]   and social spending exceeds the added tax revenues.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.360]   By the way, this discussion on immigration
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.600]   is one of the more important discussions.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.400]   Obviously, it's not being handled well
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.320]   in the broad-scale United States,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.760]   and instead we have various factions
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.120]   that are retreating into their corners
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.220]   and not having a rational discussion.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:50.800]   Anyway, it's a major problem.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.920]   Continuing on with conservative fantasies.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   Pro-growth tax policy.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.200]   Economic growth is obviously important to deficit reduction,
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.680]   and tax legislation that depresses savings and investment
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.300]   must be avoided.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.400]   Nevertheless, the historical record clearly shows
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.340]   that the vast majority of tax cuts
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.420]   do not increase tax revenues,
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.620]   especially by enough to keep pace with federal programs
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.280]   growing 6% to 7% annually.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.440]   What about eliminating welfare and lower priority spending?
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.060]   Over the past 15 years,
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.040]   congressional GOP deficit reduction budget plans
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.680]   have typically imposed nearly all the first decade's cuts
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.560]   on anti-poverty programs,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.040]   Medicaid, ACA subsidies, SNAP,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.900]   aka food stamps, and others,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.360]   as well as non-defense discretionary spending,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.520]   such as education, veterans' health,
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.640]   homeland security, medical research, and infrastructure.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   This pot of spending, 7% of GDP and declining,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.100]   would have to be mostly eliminated
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.840]   to balance the budget a decade from now.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.440]   These cuts will never be passed by any Congress,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.240]   as their advocates on Capitol Hill
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   and in top think tanks surely know.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.560]   While there are any number of failed
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.880]   and unnecessary programs in need of major reform,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.080]   proposals to eviscerate these entire categories of spending
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.480]   while letting Social Security and Medicare off the hook
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.020]   are a politically delusional distraction.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.200]   What about impossibly tight spending caps?
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   Spending caps are a vital tool
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.800]   to enforce realistic spending targets,
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.640]   but absent any achievable underlying programmatic reforms
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.200]   to meet those targets, they are an empty gimmick.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   Nevertheless, many conservative budget blueprints
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.560]   simply divide the federal budget
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.720]   into five to eight spending categories,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.440]   and then assume unprecedented cuts in targeted categories,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.780]   with no underlying policy proposals
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.460]   to achieve those targets.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.320]   For instance, President Trump's latest budget proposal
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.360]   assumes a 60% reduction by 2028
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.080]   in total non-defense discretionary spending
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.000]   as a percentage of GDP.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.400]   The budget proposal provides no breakdown
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.840]   of which specific programs would be slashed
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.480]   and how they would operate once all cuts are enacted.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.000]   The 2011 Budget Control Act has shown
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.520]   that overly tight caps will be canceled
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.580]   rather than force politically suicidal cuts.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.400]   Devolution to state governments.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.320]   There is a strong policy case for allowing states
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.080]   to have more control over poverty relief,
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.940]   education, infrastructure, economic development,
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.960]   and law enforcement spending.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.040]   However, counting the federal savings from devolution
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.280]   as the centerpiece of a deficit reduction strategy
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:40.240]   is disingenuous because it simply shifts the deficits
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.380]   and taxes to the state level,
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.980]   minus modest efficiency gains that might come
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.520]   from better state fiscal management.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.120]   The purpose of deficit reduction
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.600]   is to limit government borrowing and tax increases
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.440]   and to limit economic damage,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.420]   not merely to change the address where the taxes are sent.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.200]   What about liberal fantasies?
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.080]   What about just tax the rich?
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.360]   Liberal advocates often vastly overstate the degree
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   to which upper income tax increases
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.120]   can finance the ever expanding government.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.360]   In the first place, the US already has
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.360]   the most progressive tax code in the OECD,
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.240]   even adjusting for differences in income inequality.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   And setting aside the moral questions
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.720]   that would be raised by the government
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.040]   seizing the vast majority of any family's income,
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.240]   basic math shows that large tax increases
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   on high income Americans cannot close
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.000]   most of the long-term budget deficit.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.360]   Start with an extreme proposition,
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   a 100% tax rate on all income over $500,000.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:53.040]   Result, this would raise barely more than 5% of GDP,
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.320]   at least for year one.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.220]   After that, one needs a heroic, if not absurd projection
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.920]   that this tax would have no effect on working or investment.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.800]   Next, try a slightly more realistic doubling
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   of the top 35% and 37% tax brackets to 70% and 74%.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:20.040]   Result, this would raise only approximately 1.6% of GDP.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.320]   And even that figure ignores all revenues lost
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.080]   to the economic effects of 85% marginal tax rates
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.640]   when, including state and payroll taxes,
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.480]   on work or investment,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   as well as tax avoidance and evasion.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.240]   And by the way here, you should go and look at figure five
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.600]   in this particular report,
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.480]   where each of the various proposals,
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.840]   including that doubling, talks about,
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.880]   is calculated in terms of its actual savings
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.040]   and how far it would actually get you towards these goals.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.240]   Popular proposals to impose a 30% minimum tax
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.620]   on millionaires and to more aggressively tax banks,
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.400]   hedge fund managers, and oil and gas companies
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.320]   would raise a combined 0.1% of GDP,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.600]   or lose revenue if they trim the economic growth rate
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.720]   by even 1/20 of 1%.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   The 0.4% of GDP raised by a $25 per metric ton carbon tax
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.960]   would be passed on to households
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.100]   through higher energy bills.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.880]   The top earning 5% of families and pass-through businesses
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.700]   currently account for 30% of all income.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.840]   That means that 70% of this tax base
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.040]   comes from those outside the top 5%.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.680]   Furthermore, that top 5% already pays 42%
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.600]   of all federal taxes,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.680]   including 61% of all federal income taxes,
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.680]   which leaves less room for additional taxes.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.260]   So while some upper income tax increases are possible,
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.440]   the idea that America can close
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.920]   an $18 trillion Social Security shortfall
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.000]   and $41 trillion Medicare shortfall,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.240]   and even pay for additional spending proposals
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.360]   on the liberal agenda solely by sticking it to the rich,
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.980]   is a fantasy that finds no support in budget math.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:18.200]   Nor can corporate tax hikes close much of the gap.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.160]   America's total corporate tax revenues
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.320]   are generally in line with other developed nations.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.040]   Although modest reforms may be on the table,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.440]   major changes, such as a 10-point rate increase,
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.480]   would raise less than 0.5% of GDP,
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.320]   while giving more companies an incentive to relocate abroad.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.360]   Repealing the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.520]   would not significantly raise corporate tax revenues either,
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.540]   as that portion of the law was almost entirely paid for
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.960]   through a combination of tax offsets
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.840]   and additional revenues from projected economic growth.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.480]   An inescapable reality gets lost
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.720]   in this country's intractable budget debates.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.760]   If America wants to spend like Europe,
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.900]   it must also tax like Europe.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.640]   This means, in addition to federal and state income taxes,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.420]   a value-added tax, VAT, essentially a national sales tax,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.440]   that affects all families.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.140]   Lawmakers who pledge to stabilize the debt
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.360]   without touching government spending
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.600]   would need new tax revenues equivalent
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   to a value-added tax that rises to 17% by 2030
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.120]   and 34% by 2048.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.220]   Alternatively, lawmakers could raise the payroll tax
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:38.220]   from 15.3% to 33.5%.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.160]   Rather than concentrating all the revenues within one tax,
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.840]   Figure 5 shows that a combination of large income,
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.700]   payroll, capital gains, corporate,
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.040]   and value-added tax increases would likely be needed
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.680]   to raise 6% of GDP and stabilize the debt
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.120]   without touching Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.680]   and anti-poverty and social spending.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.360]   While it is easy to say major spending decreases
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.380]   are a non-starter, the all-tax alternative
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.060]   is even less plausible.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.680]   Now I wanna pause here just to point out
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.800]   a couple of thoughts for your personal planning.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.200]   Before we move on to deep defense cuts,
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.000]   I want you to think about what you would do
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.140]   if the top marginal tax bracket were doubled
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.000]   from 37% to 74%.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.200]   I want you to think about what you would do
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   if a national sales tax were added to the tune of 20 to 35%,
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.880]   if you had a national sales tax on all purchases
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.520]   in the United States for up to 20 to 35%,
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.200]   and/or I want you to think about if your payroll taxes
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.360]   increased from 15% to 33.5%.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.440]   What would you do?
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.060]   Because one of the scenarios that we have to plan for
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.520]   is tax planning, is what would happen
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.740]   if the United States goes down this road.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:58.800]   Now, is it possible?
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.640]   Possible.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.480]   Is it plausible?
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.300]   Plausible.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.240]   Is it probable?
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.160]   It's hard for me to see it right now,
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.000]   but demographic changes might change that.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.520]   I commonly hear people say,
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.480]   "Hey, I'm willing to pay more taxes."
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   Okay.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.600]   Maybe we go down that road.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.560]   So you need to think about what you would do
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.220]   in that situation.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.000]   Consider it.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.840]   We'll see.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.660]   I'll tell you this.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.280]   I'll teach you how to eliminate all those taxes,
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.840]   and I wouldn't be around for it.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.040]   Deep defense cuts.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.080]   What about deep defense cuts?
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.040]   Since the 1980s, the Pentagon budget has fallen
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   from 6% to 3% of GDP, not far above Europe's target of 2%.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.120]   Cutting US defense spending to the levels pledged
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.400]   by European members of NATO would save 1% of GDP,
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.080]   or roughly 1/7 of the Social Security
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.080]   and Medicare long-term shortfall.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.160]   And Europe's target level is possible
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.440]   only because its leaders can count on protection
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.240]   from a larger superpower,
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.680]   a luxury that the United States would not enjoy.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.520]   A healthy portion of America's higher defense budget
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.900]   comes from spending $100,000 per troop in compensation,
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.400]   salary, pension, housing, healthcare, and other benefits,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.960]   which lawmakers are not eager to cut.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.440]   Some long-term budget savings are possible,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.840]   though it should be noted that President Obama
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.700]   did not propose reducing the Pentagon budget
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:23.080]   to anywhere near the levels of France or the UK.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.600]   What about single-payer healthcare,
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.960]   which is, of course, quite the current discussion
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.960]   as we move into the 2020 election season,
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.000]   which, by the way, my one political jab,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.280]   which I'll make the rules close your ears.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.040]   Does anybody notice how the fact
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, was passed,
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.000]   and it was failed to be repealed by the Republicans
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.840]   who promised that they were going to do it,
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.320]   and then they failed,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.520]   has anybody noticed how that's just basically disappeared now
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:00.400]   and now the push is, well, we gotta have single-payer,
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.460]   that's the whole goal, all the energy is there?
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.840]   Let me tell you just a brief bit of historical fact
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.080]   from me, Joshua, because these are a couple of things
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.680]   that have contributed to my own personal struggles
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.280]   with all this stuff.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.080]   When the Affordable Care Act was proposed,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:21.560]   I was a, I sold health insurance.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.880]   I had gotten my insurance license
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.660]   and I sold health insurance.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.960]   And my favorite kind of health insurance to sell
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.200]   was just individual health insurance policies.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.280]   I didn't do much group health insurance work,
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.800]   I just didn't enjoy it.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.280]   I came to the conclusion that nobody liked
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   their health insurance agent
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.600]   because they were, the money,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.640]   the premiums were always going up,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.600]   just wasn't fun, I didn't care for it,
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.440]   so I didn't wanna do it.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.160]   Although I knew many successful advisors
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.640]   that would always keep a small health insurance practice
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.440]   and they'd make $100,000 a year
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.480]   from their health insurance book
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.360]   in addition to all their financial planning work.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.840]   So I always thought it could be done,
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.720]   but I just, I wasn't interested in it.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.500]   But I got appointed with a number
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.000]   of different health insurance companies,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.800]   and basically if somebody wanted health insurance,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.240]   I would just simply go to one of those companies
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.840]   and we could get just inexpensive, catastrophic,
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.420]   individual health insurance policies.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.000]   That approach has always made sense to me,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   it's always what I wanted,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.680]   I'll just pay out of pocket for all my medical bills.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.800]   I just want health insurance
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.520]   where if I have a $100,000 medical bill,
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:27.440]   then everything from 10 to $100,000
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.400]   is picked up by insurance.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.440]   And you used to be able to buy that stuff.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.080]   The policies were inexpensive,
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.340]   I sold quite a few of them and I enjoyed it.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.680]   When the Affordable Care Act was proposed,
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.040]   I started to pay attention and I really wondered about it.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.200]   And in time, I came to the perspective
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.040]   of just simply saying, this is not gonna work,
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.920]   it cannot work, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.080]   It doesn't make any sense financially.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.180]   But I would hear people advance the theory
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.560]   that the whole goal of the Affordable Care Act
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.480]   was to disrupt and destroy the health insurance marketplace
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.100]   so that it would usher in single payer healthcare.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.200]   It always sounded like a conspiracy theory
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.160]   that didn't have a lot of support.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.040]   And I just thought, no, it's probably not.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.000]   But over time in watching it,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.520]   I started to come to the conclusion,
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.680]   I said, this can't,
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.600]   nobody can think this will actually work.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.360]   The data is too clear,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.040]   nobody can actually think that this is actually work.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.960]   Well, the Affordable Care Act was passed
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.720]   middle of the night, all kinds of chicanery
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.380]   to make it pass, no bipartisan consensus,
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.540]   all Democratic paid for,
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.720]   sorry, Democratic voted for policies.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.040]   When that happened, over the next year or two,
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.120]   health insurance premiums started to go up.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.880]   And then systematically, I just,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.320]   I came, I stopped selling health insurance.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.600]   Over time, all the policies that I had sold,
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.160]   the companies massively increased their rates,
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.720]   all the people that were on those policies
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.060]   were forced off and forced onto the exchange.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.300]   Now, obviously, this did offer
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.640]   an interesting financial planning opportunity,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.500]   because previously, it had always been very important
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   that a prudent planner maintained
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.480]   their own health insurance coverage.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.420]   But when the requirement of pre-existing conditions
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.720]   was eliminated, then there became no reason
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.320]   to have to maintain coverage if you didn't want to,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.500]   and if you could work out the tax issues.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.720]   But most of my clients were not in that situation.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.000]   I liked it, many people were happy,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.120]   many sick people started signing up,
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.500]   people that had had trouble getting health insurance.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.040]   So I just kind of moved on.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.440]   Then I started to watch, after the day,
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.400]   then I started to watch all the data that came out
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   from President Obama's team
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.580]   that had been the architects of the health insurance.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.720]   And the lies that they had said were basically exposed.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.480]   And I started to think, you know what?
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.360]   I bet you there was more to this idea
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.680]   that the whole thing was designed to fail from the beginning.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.620]   'Cause when you would have the tapes
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.560]   of the architects talking about the lies,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.860]   not just the president's lies,
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.100]   not just if you like your doctor,
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.940]   you can keep your doctor,
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.800]   not if you like your plan, you can keep your plan,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.240]   not just that nonsense,
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.160]   but the actual architects, the behind the scene people.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.720]   I came to the point, I said, you know what?
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.080]   That theory now makes a lot more sense.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.520]   Now, as we watch what's happening in 2019,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.960]   that theory that I used to resist,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.800]   that just sounded too crazy to say,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.860]   oh, Obamacare was designed to fail
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.200]   to usher in single payer,
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.380]   watch what happens in the next few years.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.960]   My crystal ball is broken,
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.440]   but that theory makes a lot more sense than it ever did.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.440]   So it's a frustrating bit of historical analysis.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.040]   Just 'cause I was involved in that.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.760]   It was all stuff that I did in the last 10 years.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.460]   I saw it up front and I've had to admit
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.600]   that I was wrong 10 years ago.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.040]   And now we'll see what happens in the next couple of years.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.960]   Moving on now back to the article.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.640]   I hope you enjoyed that commentary
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.040]   and my liberal friends, you can unplug your ears now.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.000]   What about single payer healthcare?
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.680]   When confronted with rising Medicare
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.120]   and Medicaid costs driving federal deficits,
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.680]   a popular response on the left
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.320]   is to propose single payer healthcare.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.940]   The theory here is that a fully socialized health plan
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.840]   would drastically slash costs
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.080]   to families and the federal budget.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.160]   There is some debate over whether single payer
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.240]   would slightly increase
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.920]   or decrease total national health expenditures.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.500]   The most generous analysis
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.400]   of Senator Bernie Sanders Medicare for All Act
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.080]   performed by the Mercatus Center
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.960]   shows a 3% reduction
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.560]   in projected national health expenditures.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.920]   Although those savings charitably rely
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.600]   on the bill's assumption
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.980]   that private health insurance can be nationalized
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.840]   with reimbursement rates for its health providers
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.320]   cut by approximately 40%,
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   a massive reduction that the Mercatus Center analysis notes
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.080]   is wildly implausible.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.200]   Analyses that assume more realistic payment rates,
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.240]   such as those performed
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.520]   by the politically liberal Urban Institute,
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.560]   show a notable increase in national health spending
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.880]   under a single payer healthcare.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.360]   Regardless of whether total nationwide health spending
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.120]   would slightly rise or fall,
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.160]   it is obvious that transferring
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.880]   the entire healthcare system to the federal government
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.760]   would substantially increase federal spending.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.920]   Thus, virtually all analyses of single payer healthcare
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.100]   from the politically liberal Urban Institute
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.120]   to the conservative Mercatus Center
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.040]   have estimated a first decade cost of $24 trillion
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.160]   to $29 trillion to the federal government.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.440]   That is on top of current federal health spending
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.280]   that is already growing at unsustainable rates.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.840]   And if the large provider payment rate reductions
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.560]   prove to be unrealistic,
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.920]   the cost will rise by trillions more.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.760]   Some suggest that these new federal costs
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.680]   would be fully paid for by the health savings
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.240]   to families, businesses, and state governments.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.260]   This response leaves unanswered the rather large question
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.640]   of how to convert every dollar
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.160]   of current private sector
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   and state government health spending
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.800]   into a nearly $30 trillion single payer tax.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.460]   Single payer advocates have still not provided
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.360]   a tax proposal that covers more than half
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.540]   of the exorbitant federal cost.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.400]   The most likely option, a payroll tax,
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.160]   would need to be set at 30%
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.040]   on top of the current 15.3% rate.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.720]   There is no indication that Americans
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.440]   would accept tax increases this large
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.040]   even if they no longer pay premiums for health insurance.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.960]   Furthermore, these new taxes would finance
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:36.540]   only the added federal costs of the new single payer system,
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.520]   not the underlying cost of current federal health spending.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.280]   In other words, Medicare for all
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.120]   would not address Medicare's projected
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.080]   $41 trillion cash shortfall over the next three decades.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.680]   It would simply make Medicare more generous
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.800]   and then expand it to everyone under age 65.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.280]   Perhaps lawmakers should figure out how to pay
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.440]   for the current Medicare system
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.040]   before pledging nearly $30 trillion per decade to expand it.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.160]   Now we move on to cross-partisan fantasies.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.840]   Social Security Trust Fund to the rescue.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.560]   Some suggest that redeeming the $3 trillion in assets
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.040]   held by the Social Security Trust Fund
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.440]   will shield taxpayers from the cost
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.000]   of Social Security's deficits.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.320]   In the first place, this $3 trillion
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.360]   accounts for a small fraction
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:33.000]   of the system's $18 trillion cash deficit over 30 years.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.600]   More important, the Trust Fund contains
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:39.760]   no economic resources with which to pay benefits.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.080]   It consists of a pile of IOUs
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.280]   in a filing cabinet in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.280]   This $3 trillion in Social Security assets
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.640]   reflects a $3 trillion liability for taxpayers
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.320]   who must repay the bonds with interest
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.120]   over the next 16 years.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.200]   All future Social Security benefits
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.500]   will be financed by future taxes and borrowing.
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.880]   Long-term budget projections are just theory.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.680]   Americans otherwise inclined to be skeptical
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.280]   of 30-year projections should nevertheless
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.440]   take these seriously.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.720]   Future inflation rates are indeed anyone's guess,
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.360]   but the 74 million baby boomers
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.280]   retiring into Social Security and Medicare
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.000]   are an actuarial and demographic reality.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.880]   These present and future retirees exist,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.440]   and the payment formulas have already been set.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.920]   Furthermore, any future uncertainties
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.240]   are an argument for caution and prudence.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.000]   What about the argument that there's no hurry?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.840]   Some assert that lawmakers can wait 10 or 15 years
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.280]   to address this challenge.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.760]   Unfortunately, every year of delay
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.400]   raises the eventual cost of a budget fix
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.560]   because, one, on average,
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.600]   four million more baby boomers
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.640]   retire into Social Security and Medicare,
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.520]   and lawmakers have generally avoided
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.760]   reducing benefits for those already receiving them.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.200]   Two, benefit levels rise further
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.760]   above an affordable level,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.400]   and three, the larger national debt
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.440]   locks in permanently higher interest costs.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.240]   The blueprint in this report
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.200]   assumes that most reforms are implemented in 2023,
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.800]   which means that stabilizing the debt at 95% of GDP
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.040]   requires the sum of annual tax increases
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.600]   and non-interest spending cuts
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.520]   to rise to 6% of GDP by 2048.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.600]   Those required 2048 savings rise to 9% of GDP
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.920]   if reforms are delayed until 2030,
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   and 12% of GDP if reforms do not begin until 2035.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:54.800]   Now, I want to insert just a moment of commentary into this.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.000]   Remember, this paper is all predicated upon the idea
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.400]   that in five years,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.600]   these things will be put into practice,
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.320]   and if put into practice,
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.120]   these comprehensive massive cuts,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.480]   which we'll get to in a minute,
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.040]   if put into practice,
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:13.360]   this will stabilize the debt at 95% of GDP.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.080]   Not pay it off, but stabilize it at 95% of GDP.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.840]   That's the very best, most optimistic scenario.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.440]   But everything in this is built upon the idea
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.000]   that in five years, by 2023,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.800]   these reforms will be implemented.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.920]   Now, here's the problem.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.720]   In 2019, looking forward, let me ask you this.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.880]   Do you have any confidence that these reforms,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.360]   or anything close to these reforms,
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.760]   could be implemented in the coming years?
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   I cannot possibly see it in the current political scenario,
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.560]   no matter what happens with the 2020 election.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.160]   At the moment, of course, just a bit of political analysis,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.560]   at the moment in 2019,
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.360]   we have a strong and ascendant Democratic Party
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.000]   in control of the House of Representatives,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.800]   and there is a decent chance that that energy
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.440]   in the House of Representatives could continue
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.920]   with increasing gains in the Democratic majority.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.760]   It's possible.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.800]   Now, of course, the opposite is also possible,
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.400]   but it's possible.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.640]   In the Democratic Party,
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.000]   we have a strong and ascendant, hyper left-wing,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.160]   very, very big-spendy group of people.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.520]   And the massive move in the Democratic Party
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.720]   has been to the left.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.000]   Somebody like Bill Clinton looks like a Republican
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:29.840]   at this point in time,
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.440]   in terms of the massive move to the left.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.120]   Just this last week, as I record this,
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.360]   Senator Sanders has officially launched his campaign.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   Now, of course, he faces major challenges,
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.400]   but if anybody got massive traction
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.480]   in the 2016 presidential campaign, it was unexpected.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.920]   Of course, President Trump's traction was unexpected,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.360]   but then, of course, you had Senator Sanders' traction
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.520]   that was absolutely huge.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.240]   So time will play out in the next year.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.080]   We'll see what happens
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.720]   with the Democratic nominee for president.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.280]   But there is a very, it's hard to imagine
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.000]   that a centrist fiscal hawk gets elected as,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.960]   or gets nominated as a Democratic candidate for president.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.560]   Now, what about on the Republican side?
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.480]   Well, it looks like it's almost hard to see
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.760]   how anybody except President Trump
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   is the Republican nomination.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.840]   Now, in theory, if there were some kind
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.240]   of massive impeachment process,
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.560]   or some kind of massive illegal activity
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.760]   that were proved, for example,
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.800]   by the results of the Mueller report, et cetera,
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.360]   in theory, perhaps there could be
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.000]   another Republican candidate.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.680]   But first, I don't see how,
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.200]   and even if there were a Republican candidate
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.320]   other than Trump, I don't see how a Republican
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.200]   other than Trump could get reelected.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.200]   And all indications are that no such argument would,
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.040]   no such data is going to come out at this point in time.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.960]   Now, of course, the Mueller investigation
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.760]   should be issuing its report soon,
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.280]   but I don't see any good evidence
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.600]   that would indicate that we should expect
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.520]   any kind of massive upset
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.400]   to the political equilibrium right now.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   Now, will President Trump get reelected or not?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.120]   How would we, how can we know?
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.920]   But I don't see how a non-Trump Republican
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.160]   could get elected.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.080]   I don't see how any kind of other moderate
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.480]   fiscal hawk Republican,
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.040]   kind of the same old stayed conservative person.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.120]   I don't see how any person like that
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.520]   could get elected, even if they were nominated.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.280]   So you either have, as far as I can tell,
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.880]   in the presidency, you either have a President Trump,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.040]   again, for a second term, going through 2024,
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.440]   or you have a strongly left-wing,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.640]   very spendy Democrat in the presidential office.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.120]   Now, what's the only restraint?
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.680]   The only restraint would seem to be
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.920]   that there's a decent chance that the Senate,
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.800]   the fiscal restraint, I mean,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.160]   is that it seems almost impossible
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.960]   in under current projections
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.040]   that the Senate would lose its Republican majority
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.160]   for right now, for the coming election cycle,
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.200]   at the minimum.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.040]   So you could have, very plausibly,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.840]   you could have a very left-wing,
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.920]   Democrat-controlled House of Representatives,
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.520]   and a left-wing Democrat in the president.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.920]   You could have a Republican still in the presidency,
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   and a Democratic House of Representatives,
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.200]   and a Republican Senate.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.600]   Now, who knows with any of these things, right?
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.440]   We'll watch and see.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.880]   But here's the point.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.320]   Notice what is entirely absent
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.960]   in any of those scenarios that I think are plausible.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.480]   There are no fiscal conservatives.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.040]   There are no fiscal hawks, as they are known.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.320]   They're a vanishing breed.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.520]   They're disappeared.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.640]   Paul Ryan, that was his big claim to fame,
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.800]   and he's gone.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.720]   He slunk out of office, he's gone.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.480]   Who, in any case, is actually out there advocating,
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   saying we should spend less money?
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.880]   The president that was the most restrained on spending
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.440]   was President Obama.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.000]   And it wasn't because his ideology indicated
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.280]   that he should be restrained on spending.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.520]   It was because he was stymied on every side
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.400]   by a Republican majority in the House and the Senate,
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.240]   and that's what kept him
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.040]   from being able to spend much money.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.880]   So he was the biggest fiscal hawk
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.800]   of any presidency going back for a long time.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.440]   So I know this is a lot of political analysis,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.240]   but my point is, where does it come from?
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.840]   Now, let's say that you said, well, even with a whomever,
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.000]   maybe President Trump is reelected
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.480]   into the US presidency,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   but there is a Democratic majority in the House,
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.320]   and there's a strong centrist majority in the Senate.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.520]   Okay, maybe that's possible.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.400]   It certainly is possible.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.560]   But where does some coalition come together
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.960]   that says, we're gonna tackle this budget problem,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.000]   we're not actually gonna talk to each other?
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.480]   When the issues that are at hand in terms of legislation
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   are so divisive and seem so much more important
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.520]   in terms of the culture war issues
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.240]   versus trying to figure out how to rein in the budget,
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.920]   and when you have such an entrenched political majority
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.640]   of the baby boomers and their voting bloc,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.480]   how on earth does any meaningful reform get enacted?
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.280]   Now, if I'm missing something, you tell me,
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.320]   but you watch it over the next few years,
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.880]   as I will be watching it as well,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.360]   and understand that these dire scenarios
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.600]   discussed in this report
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.680]   are all predicated on, by 2023,
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.800]   being able to come up with a political solution
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.080]   that is bipartisan.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.720]   At the moment, it looks to me as though it is impossible.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.680]   I can't see the event that would change it.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.440]   The most likely course of action in my mind
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.520]   is that the US starts another major war,
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.360]   or a war is started with the US,
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.960]   and then that would just be the worst
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.600]   because everything goes out the window then,
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.440]   but time will tell.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.200]   We'll see what happens.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.320]   One more cross-partisan fantasy back to the paper.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.160]   Let the kids deal with the problem.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.800]   The final argument against reform
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.240]   asserts that Social Security and Medicare benefits
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.480]   represent an unbreakable, unamendable promise
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.320]   to the elderly.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.360]   Consequences be damned.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.000]   In reality, retirement benefits
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.400]   have been repeatedly expanded,
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.760]   far beyond what current retirees were promised
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.080]   while they were working.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.200]   For example, President George W. Bush and Congress
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.040]   decided in 2003 that current taxpayers
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.120]   would pay 75% of the prescription drug costs
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.920]   of the current typical senior.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.640]   This benefit was never earned through payroll taxes,
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.760]   and today's teenagers never signed up
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.680]   for this budget-busting deal.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.120]   One more commentary on this bit of thing.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.720]   All of this assumes some kind of nationalistic identity,
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.240]   some kind of patriotism,
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.960]   the sense that, oh, we're Americans
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.040]   and we're going to just stick with it.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.720]   I see that as eroding.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   So you have two major cultural issues
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.640]   with younger generations.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.160]   Number one is very few younger people
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.600]   seem to exhibit much particular care for older generations.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.040]   In the US American society,
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.000]   you have a general disdain on younger people
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.680]   on behalf of older people.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.240]   Age is not something that is appreciated and honored.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.800]   Rather, it's something that is generally looked down on.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.600]   People write about how they don't want to do it.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.080]   Women make stupid comments about,
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.240]   "I'm not going to tell you my age,"
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.400]   and it's supposed to be impolite
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.960]   to ask somebody their age.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.720]   There is this general societal disdain for the elderly.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.600]   This disdain is continually being expressed
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.120]   in social changes.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.680]   So American parents institutionalize their children,
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.840]   and then they turn around and wonder
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.600]   why their children institutionalize their parents.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.680]   And then in addition,
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.880]   you have a massive worldview conflicts
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   that don't seem to be able to be cared for
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.840]   and worked out in the society at large.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.600]   You have massive differences
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.920]   between older generations and younger generations
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.600]   in terms of political ideology, in worldview,
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.080]   and even just basic considerations of morality,
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.480]   of what's right, what's wrong,
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.720]   in lifestyle decisions, lifestyle choices, et cetera.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.520]   So when you put all this stuff together,
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.360]   why on earth do you think that children,
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.640]   or so, you know, kids in this context,
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.280]   why would young people want to pay
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.120]   for all the stuff that old people did?
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.920]   The disdain, even in the political space,
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.600]   of younger people to the old people,
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.160]   who view many younger people,
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.440]   especially more liberal left-wing political perspectives,
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.760]   basically view that everything that the past did was wrong,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.320]   that the United States was just
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.480]   a bunch of imperialistic Nazis,
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.760]   and now everything was wrong.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.520]   So why on earth would we expect younger people
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.840]   to say, "I'm going to buckle in,
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.680]   "and I'm going to pay this
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.400]   "to support the older generations."
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.520]   In addition, you assume that in this case,
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.200]   that children can't just simply leave.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.760]   And now you have a major change,
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   where there once was a stronger nationalistic identity
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.520]   of what it meant to be a U.S. American
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.600]   in the United States of America.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.440]   You had this context, "Well, I'm American,
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.160]   "and we get through this together."
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.560]   But in the current fractured U.S. American culture,
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.160]   I don't see much of that.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.600]   I do not see much of that at all.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.280]   And so the people like me,
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.720]   who have an affinity for what the United States
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.160]   has been, and what it has stood for,
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.720]   I have an affinity for that,
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.480]   but I don't recognize the country that I live in now.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.880]   And so why should I,
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.680]   and so I'm much more committed to those principles
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.960]   and ideals, no matter what country they are expressed in,
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.920]   than I am the actual particular country.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.560]   Now, many people have a much more liberal,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.320]   but instead of my appreciation
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.440]   for so many things in the American past,
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.960]   many of my friends and peers have nothing but disdain
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.120]   for what happened in the past.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.160]   So why on earth would that set of people stick around
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.920]   to pay much higher taxes for a bunch of old people?
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.880]   At some point, the kids are gonna stiff the old people.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.560]   I don't see any other way around it.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.320]   And those are just some of the reasons why I think
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.400]   that's a rational point of analysis.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.880]   I hope that makes sense to you,
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.360]   but I am far more conservative,
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.880]   politically, for whatever that means,
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.000]   but I'm much, I'll just use it
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.360]   'cause it's a commonly understood term.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.720]   I am far more conservative than almost anybody that I know.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.160]   And yet my plan at this point is to prepare my children
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.920]   to never have to live in the United States,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.360]   to never have to deal with this stuff.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.880]   Now, if they choose to, or if we choose to, fine.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.760]   But at this point, I'm establishing the infrastructure
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.160]   so that none of us ever have to be in the United States
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.000]   to do these problems.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.920]   And I wanna make sure that their wagons never hitched
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.640]   to the future of the United States
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.280]   if they don't choose it to be.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.640]   Now, I'm pretty extreme.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.720]   I take action more than a lot of people.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.120]   But if that's for me, who's a fairly extreme conservative,
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.520]   much more conservative than many people that I know,
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.040]   then how does that same theory not press through
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.160]   for people who are less conservative than me?
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.600]   About the thing that I don't have
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.880]   is I don't have the same kind of jingoistic,
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.120]   blind nationalism that a lot of people have.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.680]   But I don't see why many other parents
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.520]   wouldn't do what I'm doing, which is to say,
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.120]   okay, well, if the United States continues
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.600]   to provide a good value proposition
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.320]   20, 30 years from now, fine.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.240]   But I'm not gonna stick around and deal with the problem.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.640]   I didn't create it.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.480]   It's not my fault.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.320]   It's not my kids' fault.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.400]   I'm gonna help them get out.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.720]   To me, that seems practical and pragmatic.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.600]   So you assess for yourself.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.040]   But I see a small portion of the US American population
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.000]   that ascribes to this intense nationalism,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.400]   to the point of jingoism,
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.720]   that this, you know, salute the flag
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.480]   and God bless America and all this stuff.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.120]   But I don't see how that stands
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.120]   because that's only a small wing of the Republican Party.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120]   And I think most thoughtful people look at that
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.960]   and say, you know, I don't stand for this.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:43.000]   I mean, why should I salute the flag
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.840]   when it stands for all these things?
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:49.120]   And as you have an increasing rise
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.520]   and surging of more left-wing cultural issues
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.920]   in the United States, for most of us who are on the right,
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.640]   who tend to have that more nationalism perspective,
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.560]   that just increasingly adds to the shame
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.600]   and embarrassment of being associated
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.440]   with the United States
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.560]   rather than any kind of nationalistic pride.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.680]   I don't know if that's helpful or not.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.160]   It's extended commentary here on this idea
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.840]   of let the kids deal with the problem.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.480]   But you have a generational problem.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.520]   And I think you can't ever get away from that.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.480]   So I'm smack dab in the middle.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.040]   I'm a leading millennial and I'm smack dab in the middle.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.320]   And I would just say, you know, take that
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.200]   because there's a big cultural difference
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.200]   between baby boomers versus me as a millennial
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.840]   versus our children.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.920]   And the problems are going to be presented
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.720]   as my fellow millennials, as our children
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.640]   arrive at working age.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.400]   And so I think, this sounds very millennial,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.960]   but pay attention to what's happening in my generation.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.040]   And the most obvious thing you should watch is the data
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.720]   that my generation's not having children.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:02.720]   So you can't depend on our children to do that.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.960]   A few of us, of course, try to break those trends
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.080]   and single handedly reverse the birthing statistics,
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.800]   but that's a heavy load to bear.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.640]   We'll talk about that more another time.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.120]   It's not easy, as you hear in the background of today's show
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.880]   with my young children doing their very best
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.840]   to stay quiet while I record this show.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.160]   Moving on to section three, a bipartisan plan
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.520]   to stabilize the long-term federal budget.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.200]   Let's get to the actual proposals of this long proposal.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.200]   A realistic path to averting the country's
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.480]   future debt crisis will require lawmakers
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   to reject gimmicks, slogans, and empty budget targets
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.960]   in favor of plausible changes to the current arc
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.720]   of federal spending and taxes.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.760]   Specific changes whose effects on the federal budget
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.600]   can be scored by CBO methodology.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:59.840]   And because deficit reduction policies are never popular,
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:04.400]   major reforms need to be enacted on a bipartisan basis,
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.840]   much like the 1983 Social Security reforms.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.040]   Any attempt to pass these major changes on a party-line vote
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.440]   would undermine their public legitimacy,
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.240]   would be politically suicidal, and would likely be repealed
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.720]   when the opposition party returns to power.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.640]   The path put forward in this report
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.360]   is meant to achieve these objectives.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.480]   Number one, long-term fiscal sustainability.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.320]   Moving to a fully balanced budget is probably not possible.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:41.000]   However, stabilizing the national debt around 95% of GDP,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.680]   near the level projected in 2023,
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.720]   when most policies would be implemented,
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.280]   would likely stabilize the cost of interest
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.680]   on the national debt and the debt's effect on the economy.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.480]   This means annual budget deficits gradually decline
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.920]   to 3.2% of GDP over three decades.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.800]   Sustainability also means that both spending
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.600]   and tax revenues stabilize as a percentage of GDP
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.400]   rather than continue to rise in tandem.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.680]   Finally, long-term sustainability means that showy reforms,
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.360]   such as across-the-board discretionary spending cuts,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.720]   are less important than subtle entitlement reforms
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.880]   that produce larger savings over time.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.200]   Number two, achieve most savings
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.280]   from major mandatory programs.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.840]   There are three reasons for this objective.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.160]   First, it's the only solution
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.800]   that addresses the underlying problem.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.520]   Mandatory spending is the primary factor
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.440]   driving the debt upward.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.720]   CBO's long-term baseline shows that 100%
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.840]   of the long-term increase in annual budget deficits
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.280]   as a share of the economy
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.640]   comes from the rising cost of Social Security,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.360]   Medicare, and other health entitlements,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.760]   as well as the resulting interest on the debt.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.680]   Remaining federal spending is projected by CBO
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:05.080]   to continue falling as a share of the economy.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.880]   Tax revenues are projected to rise above average levels.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.600]   It is not sustainable to chase ever-rising entitlement costs
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.000]   with ever-rising tax rates
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.840]   or to eviscerate all other federal programs.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.240]   The second reason is generational equity.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.600]   Drowning younger workers in ever-rising taxes
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.560]   is no more moral than drowning them in debt,
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.840]   particularly when the entire additional tax burden
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.680]   will finance the largest intergenerational wealth transfer
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.200]   in world history.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.280]   Retirees are typically wealthier
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.800]   than working-age men and women,
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.920]   and over the years,
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.240]   Social Security and Medicare benefits have been enacted
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.520]   that far exceed retirees' lifetime contributions
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.880]   to the programs.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.120]   Rather than passing this burden on to their kids,
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.640]   they have a responsibility to pare back their benefits
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.440]   to affordable levels.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.120]   The third reason is economic.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.720]   The level of tax increases that would be necessary
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.960]   to keep pace with escalating entitlement spending,
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   including a 33% payroll tax rate or a 34% VAT,
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.200]   would retard economic growth.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.480]   Across other countries,
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.240]   the most successful fiscal consolidations,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.400]   such as Finland and the UK in the late 1990s,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.400]   have averaged 85% spending restraint and 15% new taxes.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.360]   Consolidations that failed
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.800]   or significantly harmed the economy
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.680]   were typically split more equally
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.280]   between new taxes and spending restraint.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.760]   Three, specific and plausible changes only.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.880]   Most other long-term budget proposals
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.360]   show larger and more immediate budget savings
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.680]   than this blueprint.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.160]   Unfortunately, those savings usually rely
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.320]   on some combination
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.160]   of overly optimistic economic growth assumptions,
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.480]   the immediate implementation
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.320]   of extraordinarily complicated and controversial reforms
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.920]   to major programs that in reality would take several years
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.520]   to draft, pass, implement, and phase in,
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.360]   aggressive spending cut or tax increase targets
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.360]   along with sample policy proposals
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.120]   that add up to only a small fraction
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.000]   of the required budgetary savings,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.800]   heavy reliance on unrealistically tight spending caps
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.840]   without showing how to meet them,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.720]   and combining various tax increase proposals
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.840]   that collectively result
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.800]   in unrealistically high tax burdens for certain groups
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.520]   or that generally duplicate or contradict one another.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.600]   Additionally, many long-term budget proposals
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.080]   are based on liberal or conservative pieties,
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.680]   such as taxing the rich at ultra high rates
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.120]   or eliminating most welfare
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   and domestic discretionary spending.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   This blueprint attempts to thread the needle
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.400]   of effective policy and the political reality
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.240]   that any major lasting deal must be bipartisan.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.760]   This budget blueprint works
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.720]   within the current structure of government
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.040]   rather than proposing complete rewrites
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.520]   of major programs or the tax code.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.280]   It divides reforms into four tiers
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.680]   and seeks maximum savings in a given tier
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.400]   before moving on to the next.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.640]   Tier one, squeeze out inefficiencies
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.800]   from the major health programs driving spending upward.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.880]   Tier two, trim Social Security and Medicare benefits
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.840]   for upper income retirees.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.040]   Tier three, trim other federal programs
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:23.120]   to the extent feasible on a bipartisan basis.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.760]   Tier four, close the remaining gap with new taxes
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.920]   in the broadest and least damaging manner possible.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.200]   The blueprint also provides that the lowest income 40%
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.480]   of seniors are protected from any Social Security
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.000]   or Medicare cuts,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.240]   although the Social Security full benefit retirement age
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.640]   would largely rise.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.200]   Spending cuts to anti-poverty programs are largely avoided.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.200]   Parity between discretionary defense
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.560]   and non-defense spending is maintained.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.360]   Washington structural budget deficits
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.720]   are not passed on to the nation's governors.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.680]   Tax increases are kept within reasonable limits.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:57.080]   Policy changes are phased in gradually,
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.000]   mostly beginning in 2023,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   and economic growth is assumed to be no faster
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.120]   than in CBO's long-term projection.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.720]   The first step towards scoring a long-term budget
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.640]   is a credible 30-year baseline.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.680]   Regarding this blueprint's baseline,
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.120]   it begins with CBO's June 2018 long-term budget outlook,
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.080]   which projects the 2018 to 2048 baseline
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.040]   based on current law.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.800]   Next, CBO's current law baseline is converted
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.560]   to a current policy baseline
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.120]   by assuming that expiring tax cuts and tax moratoriums
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.480]   are made permanent for reasons explained
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.120]   in the following paragraph.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.720]   Spending on discretionary and smaller mandatory programs
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.440]   level off at their projected 2028 percentage of GDP.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.160]   I'm going to skip forward here
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.400]   'cause this is extremely technical.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400]   This is important, but this is the very most,
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.520]   this is the most difficult thing to pass forward
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.000]   with regard to audio, this audio format.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.960]   So I'm going to skip all of the baseline discussion here
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.560]   and move on to what actually needs to happen.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.080]   Up to now, I have read the entire paper,
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.720]   but at this point, it's just too unwieldy for audio.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.440]   So let me just give you a couple of these suggestions.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.440]   So here is the first set of suggestions.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.680]   Social security benefits, 1.2% of GDP
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.880]   trimmed from the CBO's 2048 baseline.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.320]   The Social Security Reform Act of 2016
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.920]   authored by the House Ways and Means
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.200]   Social Security Subcommittee Chairman, Sam Johnson,
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.800]   Republican from Texas, provides the starting point.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.840]   While the plan is not perfect,
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.720]   it provides significant long-term savings
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.800]   from wealthier retirees.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:33.560]   Instead of rising from 4.9% to 6.3% of GDP
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.840]   through 2048 and CBO's baseline,
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.440]   outlays under the Social Security Reform Act
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:43.360]   would rise to 5.8% of GDP by 2030.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.680]   Forgive me, I thought I could read this stuff.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.160]   It's still too complex for this audio format.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.560]   So let me just give you a summary of the proposals.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.120]   The author suggests a wide tightening
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.880]   on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.600]   and various other discretionary
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.320]   and non-discretionary spending programs.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.520]   In addition, let's move on to the tax section.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.240]   And see how that would be affected.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.800]   Getting from here to there with regard to taxes.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.480]   Relative to an updated current policy CBO baseline,
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.000]   the spending reforms in this blueprint
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.440]   would produce budget savings equal to 4.5% of GDP
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.480]   annually by 2048.
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:29.960]   To reach the blueprint's overall 6.0% of GDP
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.800]   in non-interest savings,
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.400]   the final 1.5% must come from new taxes.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.000]   A current policy CBO baseline already assumes,
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.920]   even if the 2017 tax cuts are made permanent,
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:46.080]   that revenues will still jump by 2% of GDP over this period
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.240]   because of real, meaning CPI adjusted, bracket creep,
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:52.160]   and the deluge of taxable retirement distributions
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.640]   from retiring baby boomers.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.520]   So the 1.5% of GDP tax hike proposed in this blueprint
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.920]   would bring the total 2018 to 2048 revenue increase
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.400]   to 3.5% of GDP.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.200]   The 1.5% of GDP in proposed legislative tax hikes
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.800]   consists of phasing down the tax exclusion
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.040]   for employer-provided healthcare,
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:19.040]   yielding additional revenue of 0.72% of GDP by 2048,
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.680]   raising the Medicare and Social Security payroll tax
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.480]   by one percentage point each
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.440]   while adding a one percentage point income tax surcharge
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.600]   above the level where the Social Security tax
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.760]   on earnings maxes out,
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.600]   yielding additional revenue to 0.73% of GDP,
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.800]   and allowing various so-called December tax extenders
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.760]   to be offset or expire,
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.680]   yielding additional revenue equal to 0.05% of GDP.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.440]   Starting in 2023,
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.200]   the employer healthcare tax exclusions would be capped
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.120]   at the 75th percentile of health insurance premiums
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.000]   paid by employers that year,
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.200]   replacing the Obamacare Cadillac tax
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.760]   that was never implemented.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.120]   The cap level setting a maximum deductible premium
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.720]   would then grow annually at the rate of the CPI.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.720]   Capping the exclusion will reduce business incentives
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.520]   to overspend on health benefits
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.440]   and to downplay cost containment
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.320]   and thus contribute to broader efficiency savings
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.360]   in healthcare.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.560]   It will also increase take-home pay for many workers
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:18.520]   because more of their compensation would go toward wages
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.920]   rather than health insurance premiums.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.920]   The exposure of more employee compensation
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.000]   to payroll and income taxes
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.720]   means more revenue collected by the federal government
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.240]   under this proposal equal to 0.2% of GDP.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.640]   Raising the Social Security and Medicare payroll tax
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.080]   by one percentage point each is recommended for two reasons.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.120]   First, as stated above,
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.680]   the Social Security and Medicare systems
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.640]   face a combined $100 trillion cash deficit over 30 years.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.720]   So it makes sense to concentrate budget savings
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.360]   in those two systems.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.880]   Second, any tax increases should be widely dispersed
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.840]   to minimize economic disruptions.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.640]   The alternative of imposing enormous tax hikes
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:56.960]   on one industry or group of people
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.260]   would significantly decrease incentives to work,
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.920]   save and invest and thus harm economic growth,
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.960]   which would also decrease the resulting new tax revenues.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.560]   A simple two percentage point payroll tax increase
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.680]   split between Social Security and Medicare
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.000]   will affect nearly all workers while crippling very few.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   The Social Security payroll tax maxes out
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.060]   at certain income levels, 128,700 in 2018.
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:22.200]   The blueprint proposes adding a one percentage point tax
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.220]   to income above that level
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:27.280]   so that the new tax remains proportional.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.300]   Those who would prefer that all new taxes
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.340]   come from upper income taxpayers
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.960]   should note that these taxpayers would already bear
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.000]   nearly the entire cost of 3% of GDP
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.220]   in Social Security and Medicare reforms,
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:41.780]   as well as most of the cost of scaling back
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.820]   the employer health exclusion.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.780]   Replacing the two percentage point increase
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.100]   on the Social Security and Medicare payroll tax
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.740]   with a 20 percentage point income tax hike
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.520]   on families earning above $400,000
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.420]   would raise a similar amount of revenue
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.020]   yet significantly damage the economy
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.280]   and raise equity concerns.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.140]   Alternatively, eliminating the 12.4%
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:06.540]   Social Security earnings cap, raising 0.8% of GDP,
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.940]   would combine with the benefit changes described above
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.460]   to leave Social Security with a large surplus
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.020]   and Medicare with an enormous deficit,
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.060]   while also pushing combined federal
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:19.540]   and state marginal tax rates as high as 62%.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.580]   Under this blueprint, the bottom income 40% of retirees
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.360]   would already see no reduction
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.220]   in Social Security benefit formulas
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.860]   and no hike in Medicare premiums.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.520]   And there are no significant cuts
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.140]   to anti-poverty or social spending.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:33.980]   For many who are working,
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:35.380]   the modest payroll tax increase
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:36.820]   would be their only cost
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:39.420]   of this substantial fiscal consolidation
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.740]   beyond a future higher Social Security
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:43.600]   full benefit retirement age.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.580]   Now, what about sticking to the blueprint?
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:50.060]   To maintain a balance between tax and spending changes,
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:51.780]   lawmakers would need to codify
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:54.680]   the spending and tax proposals in this blueprint
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.400]   with 30-year targets.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.060]   Every five years, lawmakers should be required
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.400]   to ensure that Social Security, Medicare,
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.300]   Medicaid and tax revenues each remain
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.200]   on their original 30-year path
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.600]   and to enact further reforms for any category
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.040]   whose savings are not materializing.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.860]   Failure to return any veering categories
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.220]   to their present path would trigger automatic reforms
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.660]   to the given category.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:18.640]   Pay-go laws and statutory discretionary spending caps
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.160]   can help keep the rest of the budget on its preset path.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.640]   Statutory caps would be useful
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.280]   because they would reflect a bipartisan consensus
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.720]   and specific underlying reforms.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.380]   If lower deficits should emerge,
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.880]   such as from higher tax revenues
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.320]   thanks to faster economic growth
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.160]   or lower healthcare spending
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.320]   due to more expanded efficiencies,
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.400]   lawmakers should first be required
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.080]   to offset any recent budgetary losses
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.300]   from recessions or emergency spending.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.040]   If lower deficits should emerge,
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.000]   such as from higher tax revenues
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.120]   thanks to faster economic growth
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.480]   or lower healthcare spending
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.600]   due to more expanded efficiencies,
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.760]   lawmakers should first be required
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.100]   to offset any recent budgetary losses
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.800]   from recessions or emergency spending.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.520]   Once that is done, the next 1% of GDP and savings
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.680]   should remain unspent as a down payment
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.300]   on future emergencies or recessions.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.320]   Only after that should lawmakers consider
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.000]   temporary new tax cuts or spending increases.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.300]   Congress should avoid enacting
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.720]   permanently expensive policies
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.860]   in response to temporary savings windfalls,
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.360]   especially consider that even with a stabilized debt,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.040]   the annual budget will still be in deficit.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.040]   Now, I wanna skip past the group impacts.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.200]   I just wanna say this.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.400]   I appreciate reading articles like this
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.240]   because they show that in theory,
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.800]   if you have certain preconditions,
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.140]   there are solutions to big problems.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.820]   And I appreciate that.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.780]   However, some of those preconditions
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.060]   are pretty substantial.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.540]   For example, I would say this assumes
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:55.460]   that you have an educated and intelligent electorate
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.500]   willing to disregard self-interest
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.620]   and things that are personally gratifying
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.220]   in favor of voting for people
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.420]   who are virtuous representatives
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.220]   of what's in the long-term best interest of the people.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.260]   Sounds nice.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.100]   I don't see it.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.060]   I just don't see it.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.920]   We don't have an intelligent and educated electorate.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:18.000]   We have a stupid and distracted electorate.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.520]   We don't have people who understand
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.520]   or can even concede of the intricacies
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:26.720]   of this kind of thing.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.320]   We have people who are motivated by slogans
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.880]   and foolish things.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.640]   The average audience of radical personal finance
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.320]   is in a very high echelon of the general population.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.760]   The fact that I use words,
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.420]   I mean, I'm using an advanced,
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:44.980]   this entire paper is written
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.580]   in advanced college vocabulary.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.900]   This entire discussion is complex.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.100]   It's dealing, you need a high degree of numeracy
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.020]   to sustain these things.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.780]   I'm an hour and 40 minutes into this discussion,
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.460]   which means that I have no doubt lost 80%
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:05.120]   of the radical personal finance listening audience,
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.740]   which is in a tiny fraction of the general population.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.800]   The US American electorate is not educated,
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.040]   is not intelligent, and is not virtuous enough
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.960]   to vote for things that are against their self-interest.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.760]   Even those who are virtuous and willing
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.520]   to conceive of voting for things
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.900]   that are against their self-interest,
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.720]   their own personal self-interest,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.280]   do not trust the system.
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.520]   They simply do not trust.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.260]   I would be willing to vote for something
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.880]   that would be against my own personal self-interest.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.200]   I think of myself as a fairly virtuous person.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.340]   Whether that's true or not, who knows?
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.540]   You have to judge that.
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.100]   But I think of myself that way.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.860]   I'm willing to sacrifice.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.780]   I would be willing to sacrifice.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:52.900]   So forgive me for pushing myself forward.
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.700]   Just simply saying that I appreciate
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.780]   that sometimes difficult decisions have to be made.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:01.780]   I don't trust the system to think that a vote
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.980]   that's against myself would in any way work,
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.420]   because then I would have to trust
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.580]   the virtue of the politicians.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:09.460]   I would have to trust that the system
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:11.180]   is going to be worked out equitably.
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.180]   And all I see on any hand is nothing but favoritism,
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:18.060]   crony capitalism.
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.540]   I have no trust whatsoever.
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.820]   So first you need a virtuous, educated, intelligent
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.460]   electorate that would be willing to vote
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.700]   against their own self-interest
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.740]   rather than to vote in tribalism.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.100]   Ain't gonna happen.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:33.140]   The average American citizen
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:36.820]   is destroyed.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.220]   The average American citizen cannot pass
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:43.820]   just the most basic level of civic understanding.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:46.060]   It's absolutely not gonna happen.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.060]   And to get it back would require,
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.020]   will require, would require generational change.
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:55.820]   You have to completely transform the educational system,
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:59.100]   which means you have to, I mean, it's impossible.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.020]   It's absolutely impossible.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:00.940]   Next problem.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:05.940]   It requires a virtuous and trustworthy political class,
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:09.240]   which nobody thinks is gonna happen.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:13.900]   Who is the virtuous and trustworthy politician
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:15.100]   that you can name to me?
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.360]   Who?
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.520]   I think we could probably, in discussion,
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.940]   we could probably come up with a handful of people,
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:26.620]   maybe five to 10 that we would agree on
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.020]   from various political persuasions.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.180]   We would say, okay, this person believes what they say,
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:34.300]   their life is consistent behind it.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.460]   But you look at almost any person,
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.980]   and there is so much hypocrisy in their approach,
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:45.300]   you look at almost any politician,
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.860]   and you don't trust them a bit.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.900]   You know that they're liars,
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.540]   whether they're on the conservative side
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:55.340]   and you've got this leading former speaker of the house,
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.540]   spends years fighting drug legislation,
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:00.540]   and now is a major person involved
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:05.540]   in a drug pro-marijuana lobbyist organization.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.080]   Come on.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.080]   You have leading conservative figures who say,
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:17.080]   well, I'm all about capitalism and free markets, et cetera,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.540]   and then they move right out of office
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.420]   and they move right into lobbying
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:23.900]   for the real estate industry or the insurance industry.
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:27.940]   You have leading liberal figures who say
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:31.100]   that everybody should pay their fair share,
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.500]   and yet they have multiple houses that are expensive.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.100]   You have leading so-called environmental activists
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.420]   who propose all kinds of ideas
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:46.060]   and all kinds of ways to trim back,
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.620]   but you go and they're living in a mansion
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.020]   that consumes more electricity
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.820]   and more energy than anything else.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.300]   Or they don't take public transportation,
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:57.780]   they drive a car, or they take Uber or taxis everywhere
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.740]   instead of actually doing the stuff that they do.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:02.940]   Where is the non-hypocrite that is in office?
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.580]   Where?
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.660]   Now again, I think that the point is,
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.440]   I think there may be five.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:11.300]   Maybe there's 10, I don't know.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.700]   I doubt it.
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:15.620]   But the point is, even in difficulty
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.020]   of coming up with a few, you cannot tell me
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:21.100]   that you have a majority of the political class
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:24.340]   in the United States that aren't thieves and hypocrites,
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.260]   just simply saying what they wanna say to get elected.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.060]   And then the rest of them are stupid.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.740]   They don't have any context for these things.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:34.900]   And so all of the political class
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.700]   is basically driven by intelligent policy wonks
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:41.060]   who try to find a politician who'll grab onto that,
[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:42.900]   and then sometimes votes get through.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:44.740]   But the entire thing is broken.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:46.420]   When you have 1,000-page bills
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.860]   that are submitted 24 hours before a vote,
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.260]   nobody can read them.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.020]   If you try to read them, you can't read them
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.260]   'cause they're written in legalese.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.300]   You cannot expect any of these changes
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.220]   to happen realistically.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.500]   I can't see how anybody could be optimistic
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.660]   about some of this stuff happening.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:07.620]   It's, sloganeering is about the very best
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:11.320]   that can be accomplished by today's political class.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.220]   So when you add those problems to the fracturing tribes
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.980]   in the US-American culture,
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:21.140]   the fracturing people, whether it's political ideology,
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:25.940]   religious ideology, lifestyle decisions, et cetera,
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:28.900]   there is no possibility of bringing this electorate
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.820]   together in a homogenous way.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:33.340]   If there's a solution, the only solution I could come up
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:36.140]   with that could, in theory, work out
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.540]   would be an increasing federalism.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.220]   But the trend is not in the direction
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.660]   of increasing federalism.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.940]   The trend is in the direction
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:47.620]   of increasing national homogeny.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.420]   There's no solution.
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:54.780]   There's no, it doesn't, it's not realistic.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.580]   So you have an elegant, articulate plan like this,
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.580]   which doesn't try to make much progress
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.260]   except to stabilize things in a bad place.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.380]   And then you expect Congress to vote
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:07.980]   and put 30-year caps and actually stick to them.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.880]   You expect that the government wouldn't find some way
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:13.580]   to spend and reward some other class of people
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.540]   when there's a budget surplus.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:20.300]   It is absolutely, completely implausible.
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:25.180]   It's academically possible, but when compared to real life,
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:28.620]   it's utterly implausible, in my opinion.
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.220]   Now let's finish up just by reading
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.180]   this author's defense of his plan.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.180]   And I wanna apologize, I had to skip through that section
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.020]   where it's just so deep.
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.580]   If you're a policy wonk, go read it.
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.980]   I'm sorry you don't have a full description
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.080]   of every single one of those things,
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.260]   but there wouldn't be a single person listening to my voice
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.840]   if I read through the whole thing.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.420]   In defense of the plan, answering conservative critics.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:49.860]   At first glance, many conservatives will dismiss
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.460]   the proposals in this report as overly timid,
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:55.560]   specifically raising taxes by 1.5% of GDP
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.720]   rather than aggressively lowering anti-poverty
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.760]   and non-defense discretionary spending
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:03.240]   may be considered a weak need surrendered to big government.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:06.880]   Instead, it is an acknowledgement of political reality.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:10.080]   State governors will not accept or absorb Medicaid caps
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.600]   that grow no faster than the inflation rate.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:15.080]   ACA will not likely be replaced with nothing,
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.360]   as proved in 2017.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.120]   The 1.5% of GDP spent on non-health,
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.720]   anti-poverty entitlements,
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.920]   which includes conservative supported policies
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.320]   like the refundable earned income tax credit
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.520]   and child credit, as well as generally untouchable programs
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.700]   like child nutrition and SSI,
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.880]   can gradually decline as a share of the economy,
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:36.560]   but they will not be eliminated or even halved
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.240]   in any foreseeable political future.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.000]   Other mandatory and non-defense discretionary spending
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.760]   is dominated by veterans income and health benefits,
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.760]   military and federal pensions, unemployment benefits,
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.560]   highways and infrastructure,
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.080]   the National Institutes of Health,
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.560]   Homeland Security, disaster relief, and K-12 funding.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.340]   They are here to stay.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:59.400]   The argument of this blueprint, simply put,
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:03.820]   is that 4.5% of GDP represents the likely outer bounds
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:06.400]   of plausible long-term spending cuts,
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.040]   relative to the 2048 baseline,
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.200]   and that the voting public would not accept
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.440]   the additional 1.5% of GDP evisceration of the safety net
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.000]   and domestic spending just to keep tax increases
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.900]   completely off the table.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:23.680]   This blueprint essentially freezes federal program spending
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.680]   at the 19.5% of GDP 2018 to 2022 pre-reform average,
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.920]   despite 74 million Americans
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.160]   retiring into Social Security and Medicare,
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.800]   and despite rising healthcare costs.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:39.840]   It is easy to come up with a conservative dream budget
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.040]   that would show greater spending savings,
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.920]   but even a hypothetical Republican congressional
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.360]   supermajority would find it politically suicidal
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.400]   to fully overhaul Social Security and Medicare
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.520]   without Democratic buy-in.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.720]   The political model should be the bipartisan
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.720]   1983 Social Security reforms, not the 2010 ACA.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.880]   Conservatives are in an especially perilous position.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.960]   Delay likely guarantees that an eventual budget deal
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:10.360]   will be increasingly tax-heavy.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.580]   Each year, four million more baby boomers retire,
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.640]   while Social Security and Medicare benefits
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:19.260]   automatically increase, essentially closing the window
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.240]   on reforming those programs.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.920]   Additionally, delays bring permanently higher interest costs
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.660]   on the growing national debt.
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.720]   Together, these two developments means
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.940]   that the savings needed to stabilize the budget
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.880]   will continue escalating at exactly the time
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.320]   when baby boomer retirements and rising benefits
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.040]   make Social Security and Medicare more difficult to reform.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.480]   Consequently, if lawmakers wait another five to 10 years,
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.360]   they will likely have missed the window
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.600]   on entitlement reform and tax increases,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.600]   including a 15 to 20% VAT, will become nearly inevitable.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.720]   This VAT would probably be enacted at a low 1 to 2% rate,
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.220]   but like the income tax a century earlier,
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:05.420]   would quickly grow into a massive federal cash machine
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:08.660]   to finance continued government expansions.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:13.200]   It is no longer possible to stabilize the national debt
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:17.300]   with revenues at 17 to 18% of GDP.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.820]   Conservatives can either concede 1.5% of GDP
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:23.380]   in limited broad-based taxes now
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:27.320]   and begin concentrating spending reforms on wealthy seniors
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.700]   rather than vulnerable populations,
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:34.640]   or wait 10 years and end up with a European-size VAT.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.180]   What about answering liberal critics?
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.660]   Many liberals will also dismiss this proposal
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:41.920]   at first glance.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.900]   Medicare premium support, significant income relating
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:46.700]   of Social Security and Medicare benefits,
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:49.060]   and state Medicaid per capita caps
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:51.200]   may be considered non-starters,
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:55.100]   especially when paired with just 1.5% of GDP
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:57.460]   in tax increases that are not limited
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.200]   to so-called millionaires.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.580]   However, tax hikes on upper income earners
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.060]   and defense cuts alone cannot close a budget gap
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:10.260]   equal to 6% of GDP by 2048.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:14.140]   Even raising the top four income tax brackets,
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:18.020]   currently 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%,
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:23.020]   to 30%, 40%, 50%, and 70% would raise just 1.6% of GDP.
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:28.060]   Or lower when deducting lost revenues
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.340]   to macroeconomic effects,
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.100]   while leaving little room to expand
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:36.220]   the 12.4% Social Security tax to higher earnings.
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:40.100]   Restoring the developed world's highest corporate tax rate
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:44.700]   would raise at most 0.7% of GDP.
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:46.660]   Proposals popular on the left
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.420]   to significantly raise taxes on capital gains,
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.980]   banks, hedge funds, multinational corporations,
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:55.020]   and oil and gas companies would barely register
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.860]   in the long run accounting.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.380]   The unforgiving budget math shows
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.460]   that heading off a debt crisis, mostly through taxes,
[01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:08.460]   must require a huge burden on the middle class.
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:13.400]   Even a 15% VAT, which is anything but progressive,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.020]   would raise just 2.6% of GDP.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.340]   Nor will other fashionable ideas
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:22.820]   put the long-term budget on a sustainable path.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:25.420]   The blueprint already assumes that defense spending
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.420]   eventually falls to 2.6% of GDP
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.800]   for the first time since the 1930s.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.120]   Single-payer healthcare has been scored
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.580]   as adding nearly $30 trillion
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.500]   in federal spending over the decade.
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:43.120]   And even somehow converting all current family, business,
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:44.620]   and state government health savings
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:48.100]   into a single-payer tax to finance the initiative
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:52.460]   would still merely break even from a budgetary perspective.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.820]   It would not significantly affect
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:58.560]   Medicare's projected $41 trillion shortfall.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.620]   Significant savings to the federal budget
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:03.420]   must come from the spending side.
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:05.020]   Who should bear the burden?
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.380]   Presumably, protecting low-income families
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.880]   and discretionary social spending
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.940]   are top liberal priorities.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.460]   Defense spending is already projected to continue falling.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.620]   That leaves healthcare inefficiencies
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.860]   and well-off seniors to provide
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.020]   the remaining spending savings.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.700]   For liberals who believe that the rich
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.180]   should pay for their fair share,
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:28.540]   trimming their large Social Security benefits
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.540]   and Medicare subsidies accomplishes the same redistribution
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.820]   as raising upper-income taxes,
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.200]   but without the economic damage.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.220]   Furthermore, paring back their benefits
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.660]   avoids the intergenerational redistribution
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.540]   of burying today's workers in taxes
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.140]   to finance baby boomer benefits.
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:49.600]   Within a decade, the wealthiest half of seniors,
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.120]   in other words, the wealthiest members
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.660]   of the wealthiest age group,
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:55.700]   will otherwise collect $300 billion
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.980]   in annual Medicare Part B and D subsidies
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.560]   that were never earned with payroll taxes.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:05.100]   That would exceed total federal anti-poverty outlays
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.420]   on SNAP, EITC, SSI, child nutrition,
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:10.500]   and the child tax credit.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:13.180]   The Medicare premium support policy proposed here
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.100]   is generously set at the level of funding
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.620]   of the average bid plan, rather than the more common,
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:20.500]   let me skip on, let me just skip on to the conclusion.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.820]   If you're interested in liberal arguments,
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.260]   if you're a liberal, read those.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:26.540]   Conclusion, for decades, economists and policy experts
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:30.100]   warned that a budgetary and economic tsunami would come
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.220]   when the 74 million baby boomers
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.620]   retire into Social Security and Medicare.
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:39.460]   Nevertheless, a parade of presidents and congresses
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.600]   did nothing to avert the crisis.
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:45.660]   To the contrary, both parties added
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:49.460]   a new Medicare drug entitlement in 2003,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.460]   after which the Affordable Care Act
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:54.980]   further expanded federal health obligations for Medicaid
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:58.300]   and new subsidized health insurance exchanges.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:02.420]   Today, one third of the baby boomers have already retired,
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:06.940]   and another one third will retire over the next six years.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:10.220]   Annual budget deficits will soon pass $1 trillion
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.060]   on the way to $2 trillion,
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:15.700]   and possibly $3 trillion in 10 to 15 years.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.900]   Overall, the Social Security and Medicare systems
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:23.420]   face an unfathomable $100 trillion cash deficit
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.980]   over 30 years.
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:29.980]   Without reform, runaway deficits will all but guarantee
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:33.420]   a debt crisis that will profoundly damage
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:36.600]   the country's economic and social order.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.580]   There is still time to avoid that crisis,
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:43.140]   but it will require the nation's fractious political leaders
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:47.380]   to leave their respective comfort zones and compromise.
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:51.600]   And thus endeth the paper.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.860]   I hope that you made it through,
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:59.540]   and apologies for burying you with the data,
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.380]   with all the numbers.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:03.860]   I know it's hard in audio format, but it's important,
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:07.700]   and I want you to pay attention to it.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:09.780]   And I decided to go ahead and bury you
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:13.840]   with two hours of data and policy wonk discussion,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.420]   because I thought it was well done.
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:16.640]   I thought it was fairly balanced,
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:19.940]   but I thought it did a good job of showing the basic problem.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:28.220]   I don't see a solution for the macro economy.
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:32.620]   I don't see a solution for the macro budget, et cetera.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.820]   To think that, and here's just one more comment.
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.620]   I've inserted, of course, a lot of commentary.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:40.180]   I didn't intend to, but I'm a talk show host.
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:41.020]   I can't help it.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.820]   Just even the closing point.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:45.980]   There is still time to avoid that crisis,
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.220]   but it will require the nation's fractious political leaders
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.900]   to leave their respective comfort zones and compromise.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:56.420]   The biggest reason why I think that is impossible
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:59.940]   is from my observation, it seems to me
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:05.820]   that political leaders have stopped trusting one another,
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:07.500]   and I think they have good reason
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.940]   to stop trusting one another.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:13.060]   If I were in politics, I would have a very hard time
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:17.060]   believing that I'm negotiating in good faith
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.780]   with another politician.
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.160]   I think there are political leaders
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.740]   who would be willing to negotiate these things
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:31.480]   if they believed that the opposition was in good faith.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.140]   I think most adults, especially adults
[01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:35.460]   who have a little bit of experience,
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:38.900]   recognize that in life, you don't always get what you want.
[01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:40.780]   Sometimes you get what you need.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:42.860]   You don't always get what you want.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:47.740]   And so, although I would argue for a hardline position,
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:50.780]   all of us, even when we argue for a hardline position,
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:53.380]   we would concede that I can't get there overnight,
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:56.140]   and in fact, it's not good for me to get there overnight.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:00.780]   Almost any person in almost any issue that you look at
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.900]   who would make a hardline argument
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:06.120]   would concede that you need time for things to adjust.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.660]   But how much trust would you have,
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.420]   if you were a political leader,
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.480]   that your opposition is in good faith?
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:17.940]   I don't think anybody on any side of the political issue
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.700]   thinks that their opponents are acting in good faith.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:23.300]   I've tried to read activists
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.580]   on all sides of the political debate,
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:28.340]   and what I observe in my reading is
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.900]   nobody thinks the other side is genuine.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:33.060]   Nobody thinks they're acting in good faith.
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.280]   And I think everybody has substantial evidence
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:40.860]   that would say that they're right.
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:45.460]   Being of the more conservative political bent,
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:47.420]   the more freedom-oriented political bent,
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:50.000]   I would like to believe that my side is better,
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.380]   but I would have to concede
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.860]   that that could just be my own desire to see that confirmed.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:57.120]   I think it might be true,
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.820]   but I see enough that I can understand
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:02.220]   how people who would be night and day different from me
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:05.860]   would say, "You're not acting in good faith."
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.060]   I can see that.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:10.420]   So what do I have to defend?
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:14.060]   So if you can't even trust on the simplest of issues
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:16.300]   that your opponents are gonna act in good faith,
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.780]   that they're gonna speak in good faith,
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.620]   that they're gonna debate in good faith,
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:21.740]   on the simple issues,
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:24.440]   how on earth do you solve something as complex
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.580]   as this budget nightmare?
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:28.880]   How do you get there?
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.020]   Now, I hope I'm wrong.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.100]   I desperately hope I'm wrong,
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:39.060]   'cause friends, we don't wanna go through a budget,
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.500]   an economic crisis.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.220]   It is a nightmare.
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:43.080]   It is a nightmare.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.220]   We don't wanna do it.
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:47.300]   It is not, if it's your fantasy that you think,
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:48.660]   "Well, there's gonna be no rule of law.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.580]   "Without rule of law, I'm gonna be able to do what I want."
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.900]   Nonsense, it is a nightmare.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:54.180]   It is an absolute nightmare.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.860]   We don't want to go through it.
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:01.080]   It will be pain, depression, dissolution,
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.320]   suicide on all hands, death on all sides,
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:08.600]   massive decline in lifestyle,
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:10.640]   massive decline in safety,
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:14.000]   massive increase in violence and the risk of violence.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.220]   It's not, you don't wanna go through it.
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:18.080]   I don't wanna go through it.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:19.780]   So I desperately hope I'm wrong.
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:24.240]   And if I can find evidence that says that I'm wrong,
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.660]   I will share that with you.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:31.540]   But at this point, the data seems pretty clear.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:34.260]   And when I add all the little bits that I've inserted here
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:36.380]   into what I've already shared with you,
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:40.320]   I don't see how a political solution is possible.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.220]   I do not see it.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.340]   I hope I'm wrong again.
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:44.660]   I don't see it.
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:49.660]   Which means it's time for you and me to prepare.
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.300]   Here's what I do observe.
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.460]   Although the national and international solutions
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.580]   to me seem impossible,
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:03.640]   the personal solutions are not.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:09.020]   You may not be able to do anything about the level of debt
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.280]   in the United States of America,
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:16.160]   but you can do something about your family's level of debt.
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.960]   You may not be able to do anything
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:25.960]   about the impact of taxes on the broad citizenry,
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:31.020]   but you can do a massive change on your level of taxes.
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:35.840]   You may not be able to do anything at all
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.620]   about trying to develop a virtuous citizenry
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:44.200]   of knowledgeable people who understand civics
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.400]   and who are willing to vote for the things
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.360]   that are in the best interest of their fellow citizens.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.360]   But you can do something about your own positions,
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:55.720]   your family.
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.160]   You may not be able to do anything at all
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.800]   about the Department of Education,
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.600]   either doubling it if that's what you wanna do
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.260]   or eliminating it if that's what you wanna do.
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:06.320]   But you can do something
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.040]   about your family's Department of Education.
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.440]   And so as with many things,
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.440]   while broad-based collectivist solutions seem impossible,
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.840]   individual solutions are very, very possible.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:24.480]   There is time for you
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:27.960]   to establish the necessary individual solutions.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:31.480]   There is time for you to leave the United States.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:34.640]   There is time for you to get out of debt.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.800]   There is time for you to educate your children.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:40.640]   There is time for you to get in better shape.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:43.600]   There is time for you to be in a situation
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:44.440]   where you're wealthy enough
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.840]   that you never need a dime from Social Security
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:49.200]   and that you don't need anything from Medicare.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.180]   I wanna be a solutions-oriented guy.
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:56.080]   I don't see any solutions in this world
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:59.500]   of political, collectivist, statist nonsense.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:04.760]   All I see is reaping the problems of the past.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.160]   And that's basically what happens.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.800]   Why are we in this nightmare?
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:11.320]   Well, because past politicians got elected
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.160]   by promising that they could give away other people's money.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:16.680]   That's how it happened.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.800]   Why, the bulk of this is not due to the fact
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:22.740]   that the federal government builds roads.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:26.520]   It's the most, you know,
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:29.240]   the most being of a more libertarian perspective,
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.640]   the thing that libertarians laugh at every time
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.160]   they've said, "Well, if you eliminate the government,
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.440]   "who's gonna build the roads?"
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:35.520]   The roads aren't the problem.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.960]   And the answer is the people are gonna build the roads
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.200]   'cause the government doesn't build the roads.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.580]   All they do is take from one person
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.980]   to pay to a company that builds the roads.
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:42.840]   Anyway, the roads are easy.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.720]   But you can keep the road department.
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:47.480]   I don't know any libertarians
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:50.040]   who are that upset about driving on roads.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:53.840]   What you can't keep is this nightmare.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.400]   You can't keep Social Security.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.560]   You can't keep Medicare.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:57.760]   You can't keep Medicaid.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.960]   You can't keep a defense spending that spends,
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.640]   this is right, what?
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.800]   The US government spends more money on the military
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.160]   than the next, what, 25 countries combined?
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.280]   Something like that?
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.120]   Check me on that.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.420]   That's, I shouldn't.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.800]   Anyway, something like that.
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.780]   You can't keep a global empire.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.700]   You can't keep it all propped up
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:21.260]   with fake money borrowed from other people.
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.200]   You cannot do it.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.600]   You can't destroy the families
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.860]   that form the bulk of a society.
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.940]   You can't destroy the children
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:32.100]   by sticking them into mandatory educational,
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.420]   compulsory schooling systems
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:35.180]   that are designed to destroy them.
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.340]   You can't destroy the family unit
[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.480]   that holds a society together.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.500]   You cannot destroy those things and expect it to go on.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.560]   So keep the roads.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.020]   I'll pay taxes for roads.
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:49.520]   But the rest of this, we're getting our just desserts.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.520]   But you can't unravel 80 years of,
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:59.620]   90 years of this progressivist utopia
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:03.080]   and expect it not to be painful.
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:04.360]   It's gonna stink.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.600]   It's gonna be painful.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.880]   I forget why I started that rant.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:13.720]   Just simply that we're going to pay for our sins.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.520]   You always pay for sins.
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:20.320]   You cannot steal and then create a whole class of voters
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:24.280]   whose entire political ideology is stealing
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:26.360]   against the people that don't deserve it
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.800]   and who has nothing related to their own virtue.
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.520]   Everybody wants to steal from everyone else.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.360]   Well, that doesn't work.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:35.060]   I thank God he set up a system
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:37.820]   in which morality and virtue rule.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.460]   Now you can reject that all day long,
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.960]   but when you build an empire based on theft,
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:45.740]   at some point in time, that empire will come crashing down.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:46.900]   It will.
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:48.960]   That's what we're gonna see, in my opinion.
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.960]   So the point is, I see zero political solutions.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:58.800]   I feel like these problems are comprehensive.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.120]   Although I concede that it's possible
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.240]   that solutions could happen,
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:06.700]   I don't see the necessary preconditions for those solutions.
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.360]   For all the reasons previously discussed,
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.760]   no virtuous electorate, no knowledgeable electorate,
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.160]   no virtuous politicians,
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.040]   a system that rewards crony capitalism,
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:20.000]   theft, corruption, rather than virtue.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.120]   It's impossible.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:21.980]   So I'm done.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:23.080]   I'm not gonna waste my time on it.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.680]   I will watch it over the coming years and see.
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.120]   And if something happens, I will be optimistic
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:31.580]   and I hope I am wrong 'cause I don't want us all to suffer.
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:36.580]   But in the meantime, I see solutions individual galore.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.000]   (audience member coughs)
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:40.840]   Guess what?
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:44.600]   If you don't wanna be wrapped up in this nightmare,
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:45.560]   you don't have to.
[02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:50.400]   And one of the big things that I said
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:52.760]   in this new course that I've just launched,
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:56.080]   why did I tell you guys I'm no longer in the United States?
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.540]   Simplest way to remove yourself from all this, just leave.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:03.040]   Because while the United States is destroying itself,
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.360]   there are places in the world that are not.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:06.560]   And you can put together solutions.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.160]   Now, I don't think that's the right solution for everyone.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.640]   There are a lot of things that are wonderful
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:10.480]   about the United States.
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:12.280]   In many ways, it's the best place to be right now
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:13.180]   in the world.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:15.560]   But don't fall prey to this idea
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.040]   that it's just always gonna be that way.
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:17.920]   It ain't.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:19.980]   And we'll talk more about that.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:22.000]   I hope that this has been helpful to you.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.260]   I know that it's long.
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:26.400]   If you find an error in my thinking,
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.920]   if you can present to me an argument
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.400]   that would indicate that I'm wrong,
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:31.860]   I would ask you to do so.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:36.820]   It has taken me years to come to this perspective.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.820]   I don't expect it to you, if this is your first time,
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:41.420]   I don't expect you to believe it all of a sudden.
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:43.580]   I would expect, but I would encourage you
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:45.900]   to just argue with it, argue with me.
[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:48.740]   If you find something where you think I'm wrong,
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.560]   then go ahead.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:52.440]   Just don't fall prey to the same old,
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.700]   I don't know a better word than tropes,
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.840]   the same old lies, the same old myths
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:57.820]   that make you feel good.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.180]   Don't think, if you're a liberal,
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:02.900]   if you just tax the rich that everything will fix it.
[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:04.220]   Don't think, if you're a conservative,
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:06.580]   that if we just rework welfare
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:07.580]   that everything will be better.
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:08.460]   It ain't.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:10.620]   You got big systemic problems.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:14.020]   But if you do see a flaw in my thinking,
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:18.180]   please show me, because I don't wanna be a fear monger.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:19.680]   I wanna be accurate.
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:20.680]   But by going through this,
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.820]   I hope I've presented to you enough data
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:26.080]   to just help you to start to see where,
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:31.780]   it's sobering reality.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.100]   Don't be depressed.
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:37.060]   Just start making your plans and work out individual plans.
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:40.020]   And those plans are probably not that different
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:43.580]   than what you already face.
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:45.300]   Don't be poor.
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:46.140]   Be stable.
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:50.940]   We'll talk about the solutions another time.
[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:51.980]   Thank you for listening.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:55.980]   If you would like my initial salvo in this foray,
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:58.820]   I would invite you to come by
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:00.020]   and sign up for my newest course.

[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.220]   which is called How to Survive and Thrive
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:09.260]   During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:12.740]   Right now I'm doing a pre-launch sale on that,
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:13.780]   a pre-order.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:14.620]   Pre-order sale.
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:17.740]   That course will go live on March 15.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:19.100]   In the meantime, if you sign up

[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:34.740]   I would invite you to come by and buy that course.
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:36.300]   It will help you go a long way
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:38.780]   towards giving you some practical and realistic solutions
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:40.700]   that I've come up with for my family
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.540]   towards solving some of these problems
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.020]   and giving you options in the future,
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.660]   no matter what the future holds.
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.460]   I believe there are some good leverage points
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:51.340]   where you can take certain actions that are inexpensive,
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.660]   not difficult, and yet can make a massive difference now
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:57.820]   and benefit you if everything goes well,
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:01.380]   and yet be of massive benefit if nothing goes well at all.
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:03.460]   So it's a win-win either way.
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.060]   And that's the stuff that I'm focused on
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.700]   because there are a lot of those things that you can do
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.460]   that are a benefit either way.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:11.100]   So come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com,
