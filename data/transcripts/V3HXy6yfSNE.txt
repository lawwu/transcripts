[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   The most important thing I like to say at the beginning of any interview is like, this
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.180]   is not like hippy dippy, yay, let's feel our feelings and your physical pain goes away.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.760]   And even though that's wonderful and nothing against that, this is straight up brain science.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.840]   And so that's like the most important thing that I can get people to understand, which
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.000]   is when we repress our emotions enough, it sends a signal to our nervous system that
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.360]   we're in danger.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.160]   The reason we're in danger is because the nervous system perceives your repressed emotional
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.040]   world as a predator to your life.
