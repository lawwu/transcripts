[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960]   - Bringing the queen out.
[00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.880]   - Uh-oh, that's my girl.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.120]   This girl is crazy.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Oh no, don't do that.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.120]   Don't bring stuff out.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.120]   - Yeah, let me get some other people in the party.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.920]   - I'm gonna sacrifice pieces to make you think
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   you're doing good.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.820]   - Ponder me, right?
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.400]   Well, since you're gonna do that,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.160]   and I figured you was gonna do that,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.040]   I'm gonna let you do what you wanna do
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.080]   so I can do what I wanna do.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.440]   - Thank you, this is good.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.880]   A few months back, I did a podcast with RZA,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.480]   and we played an impromptu game of chess afterwards.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.040]   I wasn't sure if anyone wants to see that,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.200]   but a few folks asked me about it, so here it is.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.680]   Let me know if you want to see me play chess, have fun,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.080]   and of course, talk a bit of trash with folks in the future.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.120]   I should also say that when I was a kid,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.680]   I deliberately decided to not play chess
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   because given my generally mathematical mind and interests,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.400]   I would be pulled all in.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.240]   Moderation would be impossible.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.360]   I'm the same with fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.660]   I don't know how to eat just one.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.400]   Instead, I chose to avoid the game,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   playing maybe on a rare occasion
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   of a few years at a party, probably drunk,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.680]   and have lots of fun blundering all over the place
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.160]   and talking trash.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.760]   I do think chess is a beautiful game,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.680]   and I do want to celebrate it.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.320]   And perhaps my low level of play
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.520]   and my approach of fun is a good way to do so
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.600]   because if you're a beginner,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.760]   we're in this together, my friend.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.200]   Chess is not just about opening lines, positions, tactics.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.120]   It's also about two humans using their mind
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.400]   to solve weird little puzzles
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.200]   while chatting it up and having fun.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.640]   In this life, dear friends,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.880]   you have two approaches to choose for each activity.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.260]   Have fun trying to be good or have fun being bad.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.400]   For me, I try to do a bit of both.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.840]   For chess, I choose the latter.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.720]   So let me know if you want to see
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.040]   more videos of me playing chess.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.980]   Now, I give you RZA.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.840]   Playing chess with RZA.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.080]   - I'll do the same thing.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.200]   See what you think about that.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   - All right.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.240]   - Yeah, and I did this.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360]   - We're replaying the match.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.680]   It was already a great match.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   - Yeah, it was getting there.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.380]   - Yeah.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.020]   - I don't know about this.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.420]   What's the strongest part of your game?
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.700]   The opening, the middle?
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.340]   - I think, I don't know, 'cause I've been weak lately,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.340]   but I think that if you give me the time.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.500]   - No, we can't take the time.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.780]   This is going to be fast.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.300]   And I told you I'm terrible.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.180]   - I said, if you give me the, no, but if I get the time.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.500]   - Oh, to practice, to think.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.980]   I get pretty good at chess, if you give me the time.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.900]   But it ain't just time, it's your own fatigue,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.180]   your own feeling.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.900]   You can be angry, impatient.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.060]   - Let me just ruin it for you.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.900]   - Hyper.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.080]   - I just gotta take pieces.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.500]   Very aggressive play here.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.820]   What are we even doing?
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.780]   I'm just attacking.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.340]   What's the worst that can happen?
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.180]   - I could run.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.140]   And not be shot.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.940]   That's a big thing.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.580]   - Losing to RZA is not the worst thing in this world.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.420]   I'm telling you, I'm just gonna go on a rampage,
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.540]   just taking pieces.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.380]   - Wow.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.200]   - This is a horrible position for me.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900]   - Why did you do that then?
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.500]   You just wanted to fuck with me?
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.780]   - 'Cause I want to move fast.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.620]   - Oh, okay.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.500]   - I want to fuck with you for sure.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.860]   - Let me try this one then.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.500]   - Bring the queen out.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.020]   - Uh-oh, that's my girl.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.140]   Oh, this girl is crazy.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.820]   (laughing)
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.420]   - That's a real queen's gambit.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.140]   - There's a couple of counters.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.140]   Here's one counter that may distort the energy between us.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.780]   - Yeah, this could be a big problem.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.060]   So I would need to, there's no options, right?
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.100]   - Yeah, you gotta make a move.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.420]   - I'll stay off the white.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.820]   - I'm gonna go for the white.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.220]   - Okay.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.940]   - And then for me, okay, I see what you're doing there.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.940]   I have to hit you there for protection.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.580]   - Bring this guy out.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.460]   - That's good.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.420]   I actually didn't want you to bring that guy out, you know?
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.340]   - I got a separate, I didn't like the thing
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.340]   you had going on here.
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.660]   That's not gonna end well for me.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.740]   - Yeah, I didn't like that guy either.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.300]   I didn't like him coming outside at all.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.940]   It just felt like he should've,
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.860]   I was hoping he didn't come outside, you know?
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.020]   But he's outside now.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.100]   So now that he's outside,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.740]   when I told him not to come outside, mind you,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.340]   I gotta now think about my own problems.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.460]   - The queen and the rook are dancing in the middle.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.540]   - Yeah.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.420]   - I think I'm in way more danger.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.740]   I'm not sure though.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.820]   - Yes, it's pretty peculiar here.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.660]   - Gotta keep him distracted.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.220]   - He'll take one more punch at you.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.220]   You can't not do, you gotta make sure you do it in time.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.780]   That's really the big trick.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.180]   - Timing is everything.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.580]   - Yeah, so in that case, since timing is everything,
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.220]   let me kinda get some time away from this motherfucker.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.300]   - What do you think about pawns?
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.500]   You're like, "Oh no, don't do that.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.780]   "Don't bring stuff out."
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.100]   - Yeah, let me get some other people in the party because.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.460]   - You know, I'm gonna make it fun.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.260]   I'm gonna sacrifice pieces to make you think
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.100]   you're doing good.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.660]   - Pondering me, right?
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.220]   Well, since you're gonna do that,
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.980]   and I figured you was gonna do that,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.860]   I'm gonna let you do what you wanna do
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.900]   so I can do what I wanna do.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.780]   - Thank you, this is good.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.300]   He's not taking the quote bait.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.660]   That's not an actual bait.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.940]   - Okay, so let's get this guy out of here.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.220]   Yeah, let's get him out of here.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.460]   - See, this is not good.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.620]   I gotta threaten you somehow.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.420]   I gotta make you nervous.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.260]   Yeah, here we go.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.900]   - Oh, that's your kung fu technique,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.980]   to make me nervous.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.660]   I don't know if I'm gonna get nervous from that one.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.700]   - Watch your king, that's all I gotta say.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.740]   - I know, I see you trying to punch me in my face and shit.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.580]   - Yeah, but don't play around.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.300]   You can have the pawns.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   - I can have the pawn?
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.900]   - No, you can have the pawns.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.540]   I'm just gonna knock you out.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.500]   - Oh, he's gonna knock me out.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.340]   You guys hear this guy?
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.140]   - I'm gonna trash talk while we're still even.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.700]   I think I'm down a pawn, a couple of pawns.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.580]   - But you know what?
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.380]   It's actually, yeah, pawns don't mean shit.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.740]   You're right, the pawns is not the way for this game
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.780]   to go the way I want it to go.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.780]   So that's a fact.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.700]   - You have so many options, it's overwhelming actually.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.460]   - I'm glad you see it that way, 'cause I'm feeling the same.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.740]   But I still gotta be careful.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.100]   So since I still gotta be careful.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.140]   - This is some Grandmaster level.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.500]   - This is not. - Chats right here.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.100]   All right, so since you trying to shoot off my pinky toe.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.940]   - I just feel like you're gonna attack so much here.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.980]   And I got nothing.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.500]   I got no pawns to protect me.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.860]   I got, and these kings just sitting there.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.420]   - Yeah, but you got a couple of tricks up your sleeve though.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.700]   Let me just continue my party my way.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.220]   That's the most important thing you gotta do sometimes.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.540]   You gotta continue your party your way.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.420]   - Keep bringing pieces out.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.660]   You know what?
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.580]   I'm just gonna keep.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.780]   - That was nice.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.020]   Everybody who saw that would say the same thing.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.100]   You know what they would say?
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.940]   - What's that?
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.780]   - That was nice.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.620]   - Yeah.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.340]   - That move was nice, yo.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.180]   You seen that?
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.020]   I'm like, yeah, I saw it.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.140]   I said, I gotta take him.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.980]   You know that.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.100]   I have no choice in the matter.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:12.780]   - A Grandmaster would just forfeit here.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.180]   But I'm not that.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.020]   I'm not that.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.860]   - I like that.
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.820]   - 'Cause I'm a higher level.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.380]   - I like, well, I like the pitch of that.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.220]   - Yeah.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.460]   - He's like a Grandmaster would just forfeit here.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.740]   - No, I'm just, I'm gonna have to give you
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.700]   the Bishop of the Night.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.780]   - Well, do what you're gonna do, but don't forget.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.340]   We talked about Fisher and Spassky,
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.740]   and I started the game in the famous Fisher opening.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.780]   You know, it was good at one time.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.620]   - Yeah.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.780]   - And it's like, I'm trying to bring it back.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   - The opening or what?
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.260]   - Yeah, I'm trying to,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.940]   I really am a fan of Bobby Fisher.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.980]   I know they say he went crazy and all this stuff like that,
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.180]   but like I said, his analogy that chess is a draw,
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.220]   it's something profound in that.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.620]   And I'm just like, I'm gonna try to represent
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.340]   Bobby Fisher a little bit.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.020]   - You're the Bobby Fisher in this?
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.980]   All right.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.180]   - See that?
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.180]   Now, would everybody agree that that was beautiful?
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.580]   - I think you got a problem with too many choices.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.740]   I'm trying to paralyze you with too many good choices
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.660]   until you make a mistake.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.580]   - Which is good.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.700]   I mean, that's the meaning.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.100]   - You should be scared,
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.940]   'cause you don't wanna make a mistake on camera.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.100]   That'd be embarrassing.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.820]   'Cause you're winning, you're dominating,
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.780]   and then you could just--
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.460]   - But if he makes a mistake on camera,
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.220]   what would the world think of that?
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.020]   What would they tell him back home?
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.540]   - I'd be nervous for you, that's all I'm saying.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.500]   - Yeah, I'm getting a little bit nervous, but not totally.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.660]   And you know why I'm not totally nervous?
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.100]   - Why is that?
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.820]   - Oh, you wanna know?
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.020]   - I guess I'm just gonna have to wait and find out.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.340]   - Okay, so in that case,
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.820]   since this is one of those matches where--
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.740]   - A friendly match?
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.140]   - Yeah, a friendly match.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.220]   - I was gonna go for either that or war,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.580]   but since I'm losing, let's just go for a friendly match.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.780]   - Yeah, well, since this is a friendly match,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.860]   let's do it, let's give you something to eat.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.260]   And I'll get something to eat.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260]   You eat, I eat.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.100]   - Yeah.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.700]   - Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.580]   I think I'm gonna let that be the way we eat.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.580]   You cool with that?
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.020]   - Yeah, you give me a rook or what?
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.940]   - Yeah, why not?
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.100]   - Okay, okay, you're gonna give me...
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.140]   This is great.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.980]   - Yeah, I gotta give you something.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.940]   - This is what a generous man does.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.780]   - I'm gonna give you something to eat.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.220]   You gave me something to eat.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.660]   I'm gonna give you something to eat.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.540]   - All right.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.820]   - Okay, that was good.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.020]   Hope it tastes good.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.300]   - Yeah, it did, it feel good.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.700]   I'm winning, I'm winning.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.700]   - I hope everybody liked it.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.420]   Hope the rest of the audience is feeling it.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.740]   Like, I got this guy got a chance to eat.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.020]   - On the official chess point system, I'm up by a pawn.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.860]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.500]   - For one move, I was up.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.380]   - Well, I'm gonna get back out of your way
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.580]   'cause I didn't like, actually didn't like
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.540]   the vibe of that.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.500]   So I have to get back and protect my other rook.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.940]   - If I would've gave him two rooks.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.500]   If I would've gave him two rooks.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.340]   - That's too generous.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.300]   You're not that generous, I appreciate that.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.940]   - Yeah, the people would've been talking about me
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.100]   for years to come.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.980]   (laughing)
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.180]   Oh, look at this guy.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.020]   - He's getting nervous.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.940]   He's like, what you doing?
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.780]   You gotta...
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.620]   - I'm gonna get a good look.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.980]   - Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.100]   - So let me count my money.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.340]   You count your money, count my money.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.220]   Oh, you got more money than me.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.460]   - I gotta make you feel nervous about something.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.180]   - Whoa, that was a bad move right there, brother.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.300]   That one there.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.220]   What you gonna do with that?
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.060]   You gonna zoom in on that?
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.300]   (laughing)
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.580]   That's a blunder.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.820]   What's the, when it's a really bad blunder,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.100]   it's like super blunder or something like that.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.700]   - Yeah, well, it makes this move bad, right?
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.780]   It's a couple of things about it.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.220]   - Well, you really don't wanna bring the king out
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.380]   like that, right?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.540]   - Yeah, even if you would've left him back there,
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.300]   it would've been a better exchange for you
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.380]   because I gave you this rook, but you took the wrong rook.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.220]   - Yeah.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.460]   - You should've took this rook, right?
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.300]   - Yeah.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.860]   - But you took that rook, which I was cool with.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.900]   I was hoping you'd take that rook.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.180]   Even if you took this rook, I was cool
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.820]   'cause I would've got the horse.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.860]   And then I would've still been up two points.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.780]   - Yeah.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.100]   - But you took this rook, which was detrimental.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.580]   - 'Cause I'm gonna lose it anyway.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.380]   I'm gonna lose the knight.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.620]   And then, yeah, so you're saying I should've taken this.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.460]   That was the mistake.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.740]   - That would've been a better shot for you.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.740]   Taking that rook, 'cause now this rook
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.700]   just does something very simple.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.620]   Just goes here.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.620]   Even if it was there, though, I would've lost the rook.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.460]   - Yeah.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.500]   - Which I thought I was gonna lose.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.700]   - You would've traded it.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.220]   - Yeah, but this is worse for you.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.060]   - It's not checkmate, is it?
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.260]   - No, but it's check, but it's a tough looking check.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.620]   But you got it now, jet up out of there.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.780]   And you only could jet so many places.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.420]   - Maybe I undo the mistake 'cause I can't jet forward.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.620]   - Well. - I can't jet forward.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.540]   - No matter where you go.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.180]   But anyway, I'm not here to tell you.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.140]   - Yeah, I have to undo the mistake.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.980]   - But the point of this rook check was a discovery
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.140]   of which was set up since the beginning.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.980]   - Yeah.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.020]   - This discovery has been here for almost four or five moves.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.100]   - And so, I like, you know,
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.860]   they say white guys love black women.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.700]   - Yeah.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.540]   (laughing)
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.620]   Now I know, now I know what that means, thank you.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.460]   - Yeah.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.620]   (laughing)
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.740]   That's a tough looking check.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.260]   - Yeah, I can trick you into a draw somehow, all right.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.780]   - I think that way.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.620]   Don't you think that way?
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.700]   - Yeah.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.380]   - You got all the right philosophies, you know what I mean?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.540]   - It's not the skills.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.540]   - Well, yeah, you know, the application,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.780]   it takes time to apply everything we learn.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.620]   It just takes time.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.020]   That's definitely the right philosophy.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.740]   Everything you've been saying for this conversation
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.860]   has been the right philosophy.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.500]   Just the time to apply it has been ducking you.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.380]   - Yeah.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.740]   - So, I'll just keep this there.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.660]   And then, you know, you can take this
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.860]   as far as you want to take it.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.380]   - But I think in the interest of time,
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.380]   we're running out of time.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.220]   You have to go, man.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.500]   - Yeah, we should shake hands, thank God.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.340]   - Thank you, man.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.180]   (laughing)
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.100]   That was beautiful.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
