[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   There are small amounts of dietary cholesterol
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.400]   that do make their way into our circulation,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.040]   but it represents a small fraction
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.440]   of our total body's pool of cholesterol.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.680]   Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.800]   the guy who turned fat
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.840]   into the biggest boogeyman of all time.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.000]   Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.340]   Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol.
