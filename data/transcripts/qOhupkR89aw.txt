[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (projector whirring)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:18.280]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.900]   Most people are outside enjoying the sun right now.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.440]   We're in here talking finance, 'cause that's what we do.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.840]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840]   Duncan, the second quarter of 2022
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.240]   was one of the worst quarterly returns
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.440]   in the history of the US stock market.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   John, throw up this chart here.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.680]   I looked back, going back to the late 1920s.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.880]   The worst quarterly returns, you can see,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.140]   16% and change as of 6/30/2022.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.880]   Some of the worst ones are out a lot in the '30s, 1987.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800]   You can see there's only been, by my count,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.920]   a handful of times that it's ever gone over 20%.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.740]   Going back to the 1920s, it's like 2% of the time, right?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.560]   Now, Innovator ETFs has this defined outcome ETF
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.480]   called the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.320]   Basically, it tracks the return of the S&P to a cap,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.520]   and it's on a quarterly basis,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.680]   so we're looking at a three-month outcome.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.800]   And basically, you get 2.4% of upside,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.640]   but you're protected to 20% downside every quarter.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.040]   So, their thinking here is,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.940]   most of the time, the stock market goes up,
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.400]   and you're gonna get at least 2.4% per quarter,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.420]   and you're protected to 20% downside,
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.840]   which, again, happens roughly,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.280]   they looked back to 1950, and it happens 4% of the time.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.720]   Then, going back to 1928, it's 2%.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.400]   So, basically, if you're looking
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.200]   just to get a smaller return
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.800]   and be really protected to the downside,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.900]   you really think the stock market
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.920]   is gonna roll over again, right?
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.720]   You're one of these people that thinks it's gonna crash.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.800]   This is your thing.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.240]   You're protected for a 20% buffer over a three-month period.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.520]   Pretty interesting.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.840]   Sorry, to learn more, InnovatorETFs.com
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.760]   to learn more about their defined outcome strategies.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.960]   A lot of people have questions about these.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   A lot of people like how they define the ranges.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.620]   Go there to learn more, they have a lot of tools.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.460]   All right, Duncan.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.040]   - Yeah, and if you're interested in them,

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.400]   It makes us look good, yeah, right?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.880]   Sending traffic their way, yeah.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.840]   - Yes, Duncan likes it
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.360]   when you hit all the stuff below here in YouTube.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.440]   All right, Duncan, since just before the onset
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.400]   of the pandemic, July 2020,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.380]   think about much simpler times, right?
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.380]   The S&P 500 is up since then, 27% in total.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.560]   On an annualized basis, that's roughly 10% per year, right?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.960]   Over the last two and a half years and change,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.320]   10% per year, right?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960]   Not bad, right?
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   - Sounds good. - We'll take it.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.800]   Just think about all we've gone through in that time.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.600]   Pandemics, lockdowns, negative oil prices, supply shocks,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.320]   geopolitical crises, 40-year high inflation, all this stuff,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.700]   and yet the stock market has returned 10% a year.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.600]   People in the comments will probably say,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   "Yeah, we gave $6 trillion at it," whatever.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.840]   But that 27% gain includes a 34% drawdown
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   in February and March 2020,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.460]   then a gain of 120% from those lows
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.200]   through January 3rd of this year,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   and then at its worst point, a drawdown of roughly 24%
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.960]   and the S&P caught 23, 24% at its worst point.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.360]   Now, I don't know, we're down 18% or something.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.500]   The stock market, John Bogle once said,
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.120]   "The stock market is a giant distraction
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160]   "to the business of investing."
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.000]   Think about that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.400]   In an almost three-year period,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.840]   all that stuff we lived through,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.000]   and we got 10% annual returns.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.840]   - It's crazy.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.680]   Yeah, I think historians will look back
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   at what happened with the market,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.680]   specifically during the pandemic,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.920]   like the worst of the pandemic,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.760]   and be pretty wowed by that.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.580]   - It is.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.560]   It's been just a crazy time,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.740]   but the stock market is just always tempting you
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.520]   to do something stupid and make a mistake, unfortunately.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.000]   And the stuff happening so much faster now,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.680]   I think it's easier to make mistakes than ever.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.960]   All right, we got a lot of good questions.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.680]   I don't think we make many mistakes from our question people.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.520]   We got a lot of people who know what they're talking about,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.320]   but just wanna kind of help better understand
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.360]   their situation.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.160]   Our question inbox, Sean, our analyst,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   who kind of tracks these each week, pulled them together.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.360]   We had a ton of good ones, so let's get into 'em right away.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   - Okay.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.640]   So up first, we have,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460]   "I've been buying the dip for the past couple of months
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.920]   "in the market and feel pretty comfortable
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040]   "with my positions.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.580]   "Should I continue to buy the dip or invest in my home?
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.520]   "i.e. new fence, additional rooms, bathroom, et cetera?"
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.840]   - Okay, I get the understanding here,
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.760]   but I look at these as two totally separate line items.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.400]   The stock market is a place that people go to
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.960]   to build wealth over the longterm
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.720]   and grow above the rate of inflation
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.880]   and keep their standard of living up,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.280]   again, over the longterm.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.120]   Does the stock market guarantee those outcomes?
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.760]   No, but is it one of your best,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.920]   highest probability bets for that to happen?
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.160]   I think so.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.800]   I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.920]   but home renovations do not give you
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.580]   that same one-to-one protection
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.040]   or even grow your wealth, right?
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.700]   So Zonda is this housing research firm,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.360]   and they put together this study showing
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.600]   the cost recouped from different renovations
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.800]   you do to your home, depending on how much you spend.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.760]   So John, fill this up here.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.640]   You can see it's a bunch of different stuff.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.120]   Bath remodel, kitchen remodel.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.240]   Let's pull in from an example.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.980]   Bath remodel recoups about 53% of your cost, right?
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.000]   Add a, do a bathroom addition, it's like 51%.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.920]   Most of the ranges are in the 50 to 60% range.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.080]   There's some that are a little higher.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.160]   I don't know what manufacturer's stone veneer is.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   Apparently that pays off pretty well.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.640]   But you can see, these are a percentage of your cost.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.360]   You're not gonna make more than you put in, right?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   So I think I kind of blame HGTV for getting people
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.280]   to think that if they fix up their home,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.560]   it's gonna be worth more.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.880]   'Cause you see those shows like Flip or Flop or whatever,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.320]   where it's like home value, $400,000.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.960]   Renovation budget, $50,000.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.060]   Home price sale, $650,000.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.200]   Profit, 200 grand.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720]   We are geniuses, right?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.440]   Then they fail to mention that all the labor's free
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.200]   because these people want free PR and home on HGTV.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.220]   And all the sales are probably finalized before it happens.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.540]   Am I an HGTV truther, Duncan?
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.500]   Yes, I am.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.760]   It's the truth. - I support you in that.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.560]   - Do I still enjoy watching HGTV occasionally?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.700]   Not gonna lie, I do.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.460]   Even though I know all of this, right?
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.960]   The point is, not all cash outlays are created equally,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.800]   right?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.100]   There was this economist back in the early 1900s,
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.400]   Irving Fisher.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.800]   And he wrote this book where he laid out
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.200]   three different types of incomes.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.400]   One of them is just money.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.980]   You know, what we use to commence commerce, right?
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.240]   The other one is just stuff that you buy,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.520]   physical stuff you buy with that money.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.080]   So it's houses and cars and food and all this stuff.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.520]   And then the third one is psychic income.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.200]   And he basically boils psychic income
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.480]   down to human enjoyment.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.300]   Like, what is gonna make you happy?
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.120]   The best example I've heard of this is a wedding dress.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.540]   There are women who will spend hundreds
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.960]   or even thousands of dollars on a wedding dress.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.640]   It's a dress you wear one time in your life
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.260]   on one day in your life.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.840]   Now, the economist would say,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.560]   "Why would you ever spend that much money
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.440]   "on something you're gonna wear one time?"
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.100]   And the bride would reply, "This gives me enjoyment.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.940]   "This makes me happy.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.540]   "This is one of the biggest days of my life.
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.420]   "It brings me enjoyment."
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.060]   So not all financial decisions have to be made
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.480]   from the idea of there's a hurdle rate, right?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.200]   Now, homes can be a decent investment
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.040]   depending on your timing,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   but they're more psychic income, probably,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   when it comes to renovations.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   Just this week, my brother is finishing up putting in a pool.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.880]   He lives about five or 10 minutes away from me.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.140]   And there's no way he's gonna recoup the cost,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.900]   especially in a state like Michigan.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.820]   It sounds like it's basically a wash.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.160]   It doesn't add to the value of your home,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.320]   but it doesn't detract.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.740]   So the money he's putting into this pool
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.240]   is not gonna help him very much.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.340]   By the way, side note,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.640]   labor supply issues are hurting him.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.440]   He could not find anyone to come spray the hydro seed stuff
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   'cause it'd dig the pool up and then it messes up the grass.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.320]   So he got four pallets of sod and said,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.200]   "Hey, can you come help me lay this down?"
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.160]   So I go help him lay it down.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.900]   I gotta admit, there's something about manual labor
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.960]   that is very cathartic.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   Seeing the fruits of your labor
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880]   and seeing the progress you can make.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   I did this for two hours and not my whole career.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   - I was about to say, I feel like if that was your day-to-day
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.480]   you might have a different take.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.680]   - I did it for two hours and I got home
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.520]   and had some ibuprofen
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.120]   and laid it on the couch 'cause my back was sore.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.600]   But I'm just saying, there's something about it.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.240]   But my brother and his family are gonna get all sorts,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.120]   and hopefully my family too,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   'cause we live nice and close to them,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.680]   they're gonna get all sorts of enjoyment out of this.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.520]   It's like a ginkgo.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.600]   It's not gonna really help them
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.440]   if they went to sell the house, right?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.080]   Now, I'm gonna give you one more option.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.700]   What if I was to say it's possible
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.140]   to both buy the dip in stocks
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.020]   and do all your home renovations, right?
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.660]   Fix up your bathroom, add a bedroom, whatever.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.820]   - Leverage.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.180]   - Well, kind of.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.900]   John, show up the home equity line.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.060]   I've used this one before.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.900]   There's almost now,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.020]   we're approaching $28 trillion in home equity.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.580]   Now, you can take out a home equity line of credit, a HELOC.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.260]   And honestly, the best reason to do this
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.920]   is to renovate your home, right?
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.980]   Because you can write off that interest for tax purposes
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.940]   and then upgrade it in a way
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.340]   that increases your enjoyment of the house, right?
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.900]   Now, I will caveat this with rates are higher.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.500]   So when I did my HELOC in summer of 2020,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.900]   I think the rates were 3%.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.100]   Pretty good deal, right?
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.140]   Now, it's probably closer to 4.5%
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.180]   last time I looked at mine.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.140]   And it's a floating number,
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.860]   so it'll probably go up a little more.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.700]   So those rates are higher.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.140]   But you do have an option to both borrow against your home,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.900]   but then use that money you're pulling from your house
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.780]   to fix up that house you live in, right?
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.380]   And you're gonna probably recoup some of the costs,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.640]   probably not all of them.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.060]   But I just don't think that the hurdle rate
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.420]   is the same when comparing fixing up your house
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   and the enjoyment it could give you
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.660]   versus investing in the stock market.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.020]   - How much lobbying did you do for that pool
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.220]   at your brother's house?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.820]   - Why do you think I helped out with the sod?
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.060]   I get to use it now because I helped him some manual labor.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.740]   But yeah, I'd be lying if I said
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.180]   I'm not a little excited about it myself.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.620]   - Yeah, no, it sounds nice.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.020]   - Let's do another one.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.800]   - Okay, and that question was from Tony, by the way.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.980]   So up next, we have a question from Scott.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.100]   I'm an economics student
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.380]   and have been following your content for a while.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.740]   Recent episodes of What Are Your Thoughts
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.980]   have placed Josh and Michael on opposite sides of a debate.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.300]   Is wealth destroyed or reallocated in a bear market?
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.140]   I would love to hear a deeper discussion of this topic.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.420]   I assume the answer is nuanced
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.900]   and specific to different examples,
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.740]   such as an individual investing in an asset,
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.980]   having it grow to a high,
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.300]   then crash without liquidating their hold,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.620]   so the wealth is first created,
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.560]   then destroyed and was not real.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.060]   On the other hand, I also see scenarios
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.600]   where a high is sold and the market bottoms,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.920]   with those who have the profit reallocating
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.420]   into other assets.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.000]   I'm very interested in both viewpoints
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.500]   and would love to learn more on the nuances,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.860]   such as, this is my favorite part of this,
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.980]   is there more wealth on paper than global fiat currency
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.140]   or are global markets capped?
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.180]   - Now, this guy's an economics student.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.560]   This is the kind of thing you have a discussion
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.860]   in the dorm room and over a six pack of beer,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.220]   and then you never come to a definitive answer.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.500]   Now, there is certainly some money
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.780]   that comes out of the stock market
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.540]   when, in a bear market, when people are selling.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.700]   The reason stocks fall is because people are selling,
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.660]   and the reason people sell is 'cause they sometimes
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.820]   wanna get more defensive and move into cash
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.740]   or money markets or CDs or something that's,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.960]   or bonds, whatever, something that's more defensive.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.220]   But it's not a one for one for the simple fact that,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.620]   and this kind of hurts your brain to think about,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.080]   for every seller, there is a buyer of stock, right?
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.920]   There has to be.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.820]   Now, of course, there are things like SPACs and IPOs
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.100]   and stock options that are kind of created out of thin air,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.380]   but for the most part, the vast majority of shares
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.780]   are trading on an exchange,
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.540]   and it's the laws of supply and demand.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.260]   And there are times where supply and demand
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.960]   simply nuke paper wealth in the stock market.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.800]   Think about an example.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.580]   So, Apple reports their earnings next week.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.140]   Let's say Tim Cook came on and said,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.980]   and after hours and said, "Airpods give you cancer," right?
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.900]   If that happens, I'm screwed,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.780]   'cause I listen to him all the time.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.980]   But he says, "Airpods give you cancer.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.740]   "Apple's stock falls 20% immediately
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.980]   "in after hours trading," right?
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.540]   They're a $2.5 trillion company.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.060]   If they lost 20%, that's what, $500 billion worth of stock.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.660]   Does that mean $500 billion came out of Apple?
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.620]   No, of course not.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.500]   A lot of it happens instantaneously,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.620]   where people want to sell,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.600]   and the only price they can get is 20% lower,
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.440]   so they have to sell,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.580]   and that effective paper wealth has just been nuked.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.640]   It's gone, it vanishes.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.940]   And this works on the other side, too, right?
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.220]   On the upside, when stocks, after hours,
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.820]   report really good earnings, and they go up 20%,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.900]   the same thing.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.700]   People aren't putting 20% more into a stock.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.340]   It's just going up.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.460]   Another way to think about this,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.180]   money has to go somewhere, right?
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.660]   Investors have to allocate between stocks,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.140]   bonds, and cash, and whatever else.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.300]   Pseudonymous blogger Jesse Livermore wrote
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.220]   what is probably one of the most popular
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.820]   fin-to-it posts of all time.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.220]   He wrote this in 2013,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.060]   and it's this blog called
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.020]   A Single Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.060]   Duncan said he tried to read it and didn't understand it.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.900]   I don't blame you.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.300]   - Yeah, this is one of those where I was,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.820]   as I was trying to read it, I was like,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.720]   I need to just ask you to explain it to me like I'm five.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.760]   - The funny thing is, he wrote this in 2013,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.900]   back when everyone was sure stocks were in a bubble.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.280]   Those were the nice days, I guess.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.760]   John, throw up this chart.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.820]   - What this chart just shows is the allocation
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.940]   of all investors to equities.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.300]   Right, you can see right now it's roughly 50%.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.700]   Back in the '70s and '80s, it was closer to like 25%,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.300]   and even dipped below there sometimes.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.860]   Now, the 1980s, the stock market was up 18% per year,
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.420]   yet investor allocations remained low
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.480]   throughout the whole decade.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.600]   They remained at 25% or lower, pretty much,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.060]   pretty much lower than 30% the whole time.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.660]   They didn't really start going up until the 1990s.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.940]   So there was a ton of wealth created in the '80s,
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.340]   but there wasn't a huge increase
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.340]   in allocations to investors.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.580]   Now, that happened in the '90s, too,
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.440]   but you can see that it finally went up
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.280]   and a lot of people got in,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.640]   but it wasn't just a ton of money pouring in the '80s.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.100]   The stock market was just up.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.940]   So I guess what I'm trying to say here is
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.320]   the reason stocks go into a bear market
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.680]   is 'cause certain investors sell,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.140]   but a lot of those losses happen so quickly
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.380]   that prices readjust in a panic.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.660]   So I'm on Team Michael and Team Joss here.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.100]   So I'm sorry, I'm splitting the baby.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.260]   They're like my children here,
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.420]   and I'll be like, I agree with both of you.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.180]   Like, they need to settle this through paper, rock, scissor,
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.700]   is what I'm trying to say.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.540]   Rock, paper, scissor?
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.740]   - It's one of those things, I feel like
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.580]   the more I've thought about it,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.980]   the more confusing it kind of is, but--
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.820]   - It hurts your head.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.060]   - A lot of people realize that,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.380]   like when we're talking about taxing unrealized gains
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.580]   is when I think people really start to understand this,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.580]   right, is like, well, wait,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.260]   just because it's gone up on paper this much
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.300]   doesn't mean I actually have that money.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.860]   It's not real. - It's hard to, yes.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.020]   It's not like there's a dollar for dollar,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.100]   this is why the stock market grows over time
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.700]   and your wealth compounds, right?
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.940]   You hope that you have more money at the end of it
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.460]   than you put in.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.940]   But yes, I'm willing to say
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.460]   I'm team Josh and team Michael here.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.660]   They're both right.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.060]   - I highlighted one line
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.420]   that I thought was a super hot take from that article.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.740]   It says, "Buy and hold is painted
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.940]   "as the informed, responsible, pro-American thing
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.320]   "to do with a portfolio,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   "but in terms of financial stability,
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.360]   "it can actually be very destructive behavior."
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.520]   Isn't that a hot take?
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.360]   It sounds like a hot take to me.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.900]   - A little bit, yeah, we'll take it.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.860]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.220]   - Okay.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.360]   Up next, we have a question from Ben.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.500]   "Question about changing risk tolerance.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.640]   "I've been invested fairly conservatively for my age,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.040]   "age 40, at about 50/50 bonds and stocks.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.520]   "I've been through a few bear markets
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.720]   "as I started saving seriously just before the GFC
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.360]   "and feel more comfortable hanging on
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.440]   "through awful markets like we're in.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.920]   "I stressed out during the GFC,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.960]   "but held on and my stomach is getting stronger
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.620]   "each time I go through a downturn.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.600]   "My question is, if I'm more comfortable
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.520]   "hanging in there with a relatively conservative portfolio,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.100]   "is this a good opportunity to rebalance
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.360]   "and dial it up a bit?
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.940]   "Maybe more of a growth portfolio
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.520]   "of 75/25 stocks to bonds?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.700]   "This is all long-term blue hair retirement money,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.020]   "mainly index funds, diversified, et cetera.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.560]   "Job is stable and all that.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.540]   "Thanks a ton.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.660]   "Also for our super young people,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.140]   "GFC is global financial crisis."
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.140]   - Yeah, that's pretty crazy
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.460]   that someone might not know that.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.220]   I'm sorry, but it's fair.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.140]   We're old, Duncan.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.140]   All right, so this is essentially an over-rebalance, right?
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.500]   I actually think a bear market is a better time
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.480]   to do this than a bull market
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.540]   if you're gonna take more risk,
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.500]   but you have to still be careful
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.540]   'cause you don't know if there's another leg
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.380]   coming down at some point.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.540]   But asset allocation is definitely
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.300]   one of the most important decisions
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.820]   that you have to make as an investor.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.260]   And this is something we spend a lot of time
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.180]   with clients on.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.800]   So I wanted to bring one of our financial advisors on here
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.640]   to give some guidance
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.780]   on how they handle these type of situations
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.540]   'cause not all portfolios are set it and forget it.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.100]   There are times when you can switch,
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.340]   whether it's your risk profile
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.160]   or your circumstances or money changing.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.340]   So Alex Palumbo, actually one of the first advisors
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.480]   we brought into Ritholtz Wealth back in what, 2016, Alex?
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.900]   - January 17th, 2016.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.740]   But who's counting?
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.620]   - Same day as Bill Sweet.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.460]   - Okay.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.300]   So I was a few months before you guys.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.140]   - Shut up, Bill.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.960]   - He's an OG.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.800]   He's been here for a while.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.620]   - Can I shut up, Bill, real quick?
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.460]   - If you want.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.500]   - So I want a controversial hot take here.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.100]   Bill and I actually came up with this exact show idea
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.780]   four years ago and we got shut down.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.420]   So then you copied us.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.500]   So right now we're in the process
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.140]   of filing a class action lawsuit.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.980]   I wanted to let you know,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.220]   and my attorney's gonna reach out to you after the show.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.140]   I just wanted to give you a heads up on that.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.740]   - Okay, remove his feet, John.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.580]   That's how you get him out of here.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.900]   - Yeah, see you later, Alex.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.300]   Nice talking to you.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.100]   Okay, so Alex, a client's come to you and says,
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.380]   "Listen, I think I've been a little too defensive.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.300]   "My risk profile, I can handle it.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.900]   "I want to dial up my risk."
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.340]   How do you approach that conversation?
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.420]   How do you, and then if you agree with that and say,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.560]   "Okay, we're gonna come to an understanding.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.100]   "You're gonna go from 50/50 to 75/25 or 60/40,
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.260]   "whatever it is."
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.660]   How do you handle that transition,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.620]   assuming it makes sense for their plan?
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.060]   - Right, so I think you hit the nail on the head here.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.100]   It definitely, you prefer to hear this from a client
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.300]   when stocks are going down
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.740]   versus when stocks are going up, right?
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.440]   That's just like better investor behavior.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.660]   But to this particular listener's question,
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.220]   he said he feels more comfortable hanging on
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.160]   through awful markets like we're in.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.100]   Of course you do, right?
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.100]   You're in 50% bonds and that's really not the only time,
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.460]   but that's the main time
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.700]   that bonds actually show their benefit.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.860]   We know that equities will 100% perform better
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.980]   in the long term.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.540]   So objectively, of course, this is a good time.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.460]   The one thing that I would take some caution in
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.500]   for this particular client, if it were a client,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.340]   is that this person is 40 right now.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.020]   Their dollar amount in terms of their investable portfolio
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.180]   is going to increase exponentially, not linearly.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.420]   So like, yeah, you have 100, 200, 500K, 50K right now.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.260]   By the time you're 50,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.500]   you should have two to three X times the assets.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.300]   And in that concept, the drawdowns are more magnified,
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.260]   especially from a dollar perspective.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.460]   So yes, this is objectively a good time.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.880]   - I do think that's an important point as you age.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.200]   Even if your portfolio is a little more defensive,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.280]   because you have more money,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.860]   it could take a smaller drawdown percentage terms,
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.600]   and in money terms, it's gonna hurt a lot more, right?
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.440]   I think that is something
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.780]   that a lot of people don't think through,
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.580]   the differences between percentages and dollars.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.180]   That can make things way more painful.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.540]   - You cannot believe the amount of conversations I have
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.500]   with retired clients with, you know, five, $10 million.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.340]   They're like, "Do you see how much money I lost?"
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.300]   And it's no fault to them.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.700]   And I'm like, you have to try to focus on the percentages.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.260]   If only from a behavioral and psychological perspective,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.340]   it's so much easier to be like,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.900]   "Hey, I'm up 15% last year.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.420]   "I'm down 8% this year."
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.900]   Once you start looking at the dollar amounts,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.780]   if you're down 10% with $10 million,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.500]   you are on paper just lost a million dollars.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.940]   And if you have no income coming in,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.020]   it's really painful to deal with.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.540]   The last thing I'll mention to this particular listener
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.020]   and commenter and questionnaire,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.420]   is that working with an advisor helps with this a lot.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.900]   I've seen this time and time again,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.660]   is that if you're managing your own assets,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.660]   going from 50/50 to 60/40 seems like a big leap.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.700]   But if you have an elite or competent team behind you,
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.780]   who's managing the portfolios for you,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.980]   who can add context to your situation
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.300]   and show you the ramifications of increasing risk
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.220]   over the short, intermediate, long-term,
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.860]   it's much easier to deal with a more risky
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.420]   slash more volatile slash more equity-heavy portfolio.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.260]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.980]   And by the way- - Plug for Red Hole 12.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.420]   - Yeah, and you saying that you came up
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.660]   with the idea for Portfolio Rescue
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.260]   is kind of like the Winklevi twins
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.540]   saying they can't get up with Facebook.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.940]   I mean, come on, right, Duncan?
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.300]   He's trying to- - Yeah.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.860]   Yeah, or Grantham saying he called the spare market
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.420]   back like eight years ago. - I kinda wish that
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.100]   the Winklevoss did come up with Facebook.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.020]   I mean, did you watch the movie?
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.620]   It was pretty clear that Zuckerberg stole it,
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.700]   but I don't want our whole thing to get shut down.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.860]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.700]   - Okay.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.460]   - This is the not to brag of the year so far, by the way.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.620]   - Yeah, no, this one actually had me thinking
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.500]   that we need to add a button, a not to brag sound effect,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.460]   and so we might actually do that.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.060]   So this one is, "My wife and I received,"
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.340]   I've never heard of anything like this,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.700]   but let us know in the chat if you've heard of this.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.100]   "My wife and I received an unexpected wedding gift
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.440]   "of $200,000 in Microsoft stock.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.600]   "As a general rule, I don't own individual stocks,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.640]   "and the bogel in me wants to transform this
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.340]   "into a diversified index.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.000]   "However, I don't want to create a large tax event
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.440]   "just to hold equities.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.860]   "My thought is to slowly diversify over time,
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.660]   "sell 5% per month, considering that Microsoft
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.900]   "is a relatively stable blue chip.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.960]   "Is it better to rip the Band-Aid off all at once?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.600]   "Is there another creative solution that I'm not considering?
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.940]   "To further complicate the issue,
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.000]   "about 40% of this might be used as a down payment
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.220]   "for a house in the next few years."
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.060]   - All right, this is from Adrian.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.740]   - Good job, I mean, you really lucked out with that.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.580]   - This is from Adrian.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.180]   "Who the hell did you invite to your wedding
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.220]   "that gave you $200,000?"
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.120]   Alex.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.540]   Alex is gonna get married in what, two weeks, Alex?
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.620]   - 15 days, but who's counting?
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460]   - 15 days.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.740]   I'm gonna give you $75 in VTI stock for your wedding, okay?
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.460]   I know it's not Twitter, K and Microsoft, but.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.060]   - That's more than what you've given me so far, so.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.100]   - I think I got like a ladle and some steak knives
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.940]   from Bed Bath & Beyond for my wedding.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.760]   This is awesome.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.420]   Now, great problem to have.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.660]   Not a bad way to start out as a new layabouts.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.700]   Alex, I know that you've had a lot of clients come to you
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.220]   with concentrated stock positions,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.620]   whether they work for a company,
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.940]   they have Amazon shares or Google shares, whatever it is,
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.300]   or maybe we've had clients in the past
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.540]   who have invested in IPOs very early on
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.580]   and have huge capital gains,
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.060]   unrealized capital gains in these stocks,
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.380]   and they come to us and they say,
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.660]   "I know I needed to diversify
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.880]   "'cause I have 80 or 90% of my wealth in this one stock.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.720]   "How do I do it?"
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.860]   So how do you typically structure these sales
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.620]   when you have a concentrated position to deal with
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.420]   from a tax perspective?
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.220]   - Yeah, this actually was a really great question.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.500]   There's a lot of nuance here, and I have a ton to say.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.660]   Shocker to you, Ben, I'm sure.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.420]   I will say, I don't think this was that much of a brag,
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.220]   but wait until the next question, spoiler alert,
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.620]   for the big time brag.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.040]   But to answer this, this is a really good question.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.780]   So first of all, right off the bat,
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.500]   5% per month does sound like a reasonable strategy, right?
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.900]   Just like baseline.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.460]   Here's the two things that really stood out to me
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.740]   in terms of concepts to consider.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.980]   If you do this over two years,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.860]   you're pretty much attempting
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.860]   to spread out your tax liability, right?
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.700]   However, if the stock is valued at $200,000,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.300]   you just got married, you listened to Portfolio Rescue,
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.620]   assuming you're doing okay for yourself,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.260]   you're most likely always gonna be in that 15% tax bracket
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.660]   in terms of the capital gains, right?
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.940]   So like, if you can sell some now
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.640]   within that 0% tax bracket, that's great.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.960]   But I would take an educated guess
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.800]   that this married couple probably doesn't make
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.340]   that little of earned income
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.580]   to be at that 0% capital gains rate.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.820]   - Well, here, how does this,
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.460]   so how does this complicate matters?
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.780]   Because they said 40% of it,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.800]   they wanna use for a down payment.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.860]   So does having a goal attached to it make you think,
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.940]   do you at least rip the bandaid off for that 40%
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.300]   and just sort of get that into something
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.260]   and then slowly with the rest?
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.340]   Does that make sense at all,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.060]   where you're kind of doing a hybrid approach
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.100]   to dollar cost averaging out of this?
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.460]   - Yes, and I was, yes, of course it does.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.620]   That, everything I was about to say
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.660]   gets thrown out the window when you wanna use this
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.440]   for a new home within the next few months.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.260]   However, from working with clients,
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.320]   when you might wanna buy a home in a few months,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   that tends to be like,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.940]   I'm not gonna buy a home for a few years.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.320]   You don't want this money invested in an individual equity
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.140]   if you're gonna buy a home
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.360]   within the next three to nine months for obvious reasons.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.000]   But the one thing I'll say regarding the taxes,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.060]   these people are probably not gonna be
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.920]   in the 20% capital gains rate.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.940]   So you're probably always gonna pay 15% capital gains tax
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.460]   on these sales.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.220]   So you don't wanna let the tail wag the dog
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.580]   in the sense where it is good to space it out
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.380]   because you will have to pay taxes on this.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.700]   That's a slight benefit.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.740]   But one thing that's important to consider
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.660]   is over the next 20 months,
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.220]   if you sell like 5% of this stock over the next,
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.900]   5% over the next 20 months,
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.640]   there's almost 100% chance that that stock is gonna move
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   much more than 5% differently than the index, right?
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.540]   And so you don't wanna let the proverbial tax tail
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.500]   walk the dog, that's what Bill always says.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.100]   So keep that in mind is that Microsoft for better or worse
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.300]   is gonna perform much differently
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.420]   than the overall index most likely.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.580]   And you're probably always gonna pay
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.220]   15% capital gains as well.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.380]   Last thing I'll mention, Ben,
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.340]   'cause I know you don't like when I ramble
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.660]   is one thing I like doing for clients is like,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.740]   don't sell in October, November, and December
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.700]   because you're like,
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.740]   let's say you sell something December 31st,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.700]   you're guaranteed to pay capital gains on that
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.780]   unless you already have losses to offset this year.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.740]   What I do a lot of the time,
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.540]   let's say we get a new client in like October
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.900]   and their portfolio isn't extremely risky
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.740]   or there's not a lot of nonsense going on.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.880]   We'll wait until January 1st to recognize gains.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.860]   That gives us 12 months to tax loss harvest on the portfolio.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.200]   - You have a budget that you can work against basically
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.420]   for the rest of the year.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.260]   - Exactly.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.060]   So like sell 10% in July, August, September,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.620]   stop and see if you can harvest losses from there.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.860]   Now you might be thinking, Duncan,
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.100]   this is gonna be very difficult
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.820]   for your average retail investor.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.300]   That's exactly why you work
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.100]   with a comprehensive financial planning firm
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.440]   who can execute all this for you.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.620]   But in all serious, another RWM plug,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.980]   there's a lot of nuance to this question
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.060]   that from like the layman eyes, you might not consider,
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.100]   but there's a lot going on here.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.360]   And if you do it correctly,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.260]   you can probably save yourself a lot of money
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.020]   and be more informed in your decision-making.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.460]   - Just an awesome wedding gift though.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.760]   I will say whoever did this for them,
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.740]   kudos to you, Bill Gates or whoever did this.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.100]   - Ben, I'm holding you to that $75 in VTI
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.140]   'cause that was just said,
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.740]   but that's more than you've given me so far.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.140]   So I'm holding you to that.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:36.980]   Thank you.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.860]   - I'm still waiting for my invite to the wedding
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.060]   and then you'll get your 75 bucks in VTI.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.740]   - All right, this is very fair.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.580]   - Sounds fair.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.620]   - All right, one more, Duncan.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.980]   - Okay.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.080]   So up next, we have a question from Alex
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   and this is a two pager, so hang in there.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.920]   My wife and I--
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.840]   - So this is one of the better,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.720]   sometimes people give us emails
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.960]   and there may be some spelling errors
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.720]   and I'm not averse to do that myself.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.840]   And there may be some people that shorten things.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.200]   This is a very well-written email.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.040]   - Yeah, it was.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.400]   And they also have, they have a certain way with words.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.240]   - Yes.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   - As people will see.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.700]   My wife and I are in the process
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.520]   of getting our financial lives together
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.220]   and I have been going through the process
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.360]   of talking to financial advisors.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.360]   I've come out the other side of this process
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.800]   wondering what the value of a financial advisor is.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.680]   My wife and I have been extremely blessed
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.400]   over the past couple of years
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.680]   and we both find ourselves in a sexy ass tax bracket
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.520]   and are fortunate enough to be able
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.580]   to put a significant amount of money to work
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.880]   now and for the foreseeable future.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.040]   We are fairly young, I'm 33 and she's 27.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.520]   Don't have kids, no debt,
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.120]   and we're both maxing out our 401ks.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.680]   At this point, we are not worth much,
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.940]   but over the last couple of years,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.200]   we've seen our incomes grow
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.560]   and haven't had time to amass enough wealth
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   to get wealth managers with white wigs and soft rumps
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.200]   to have any interest in working with us.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.560]   I gotta say, I don't even know what that means,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.840]   but I don't fault them for this.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.860]   - But it's provocative.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.360]   - Yeah, no, I mean, it sounds like shots fired.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.440]   I don't fault them for this,
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.800]   but recognize it as the reality of the situation.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.120]   I enjoy learning about the market
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.200]   and feel like if we continually put our money
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   in an S&P 500 index, we might see the same
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.720]   or similar performance as we would see
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.360]   with any financial advisor.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.680]   Part of me wants it to be more complicated than that,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.080]   but as I've listened to you guys
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.760]   and your peers in the market over the past few years,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.300]   I can't escape the impression
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.800]   that if you were to put your money in the market
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.460]   continuously and keep it there,
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.320]   you'd be hard-pressed to make it grow better
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.720]   with less stress.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.480]   I would love it if you guys could blow some holes
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.800]   in this thesis, as it seems like there has to be
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.240]   some value provided by good people out there,
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.400]   that I need someone smarter than me
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.920]   to weigh it out real nice.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.240]   - All right, I will say--
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.400]   - Basically, they're saying that you shouldn't exist,
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.440]   you shouldn't have a job, Alex.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.960]   - Well, Alex is-- - Please put me in, Ben.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   - Hang on, Alex. - I'm not on this one.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.280]   - Hang on, Alex, before I let you lose here.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.480]   I will say there are now advisors who work with people
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.880]   who have higher incomes but don't have a lot in assets.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.780]   There's hourly financial planners now.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.320]   A little plug, we have an advisor dedicated
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.840]   to our lift-off program that people who have,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.920]   don't meet the minimums for the other wealth management
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.760]   that have the ability to automate it,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.600]   invest it through Betterment,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.980]   but then also talk to one of our younger advisors, Matt.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.660]   But I will say, hiring an advisor is not for everyone.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.520]   I think there are some reasons that you wanna do it, right?
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.680]   A lot of people make some mistakes,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.840]   some people have a life event, Alex is getting married,
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   I talked with a client of ours who was a young person,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.640]   young people, a young couple who was just having
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   their first child and they have an advisor with us
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.360]   and they were having a hard time working through
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.440]   some decisions that they were making financially
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.280]   and having this first kid
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.960]   and having an advisor can help.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.280]   Not everyone needs an advisor.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.480]   I know there are a lot of smart people
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.840]   who can do it on their own and don't need one.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.480]   But Alex, what are some of the main reasons
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.400]   people have come to you to kind of give this listener
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.060]   a reason for getting an advisor in the first place?
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.500]   With the understanding that you're probably a little biased.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.020]   - I mean, sexy ass tax bracket, soft rumps.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.220]   I mean, should we mark this not safe for work?
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.060]   I mean--
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.780]   - This is probably an English major.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.620]   By the way--
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.460]   - Soft rumps.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.460]   I thought you want hard rumps, right?
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.080]   - That's why we do squats and lunges here.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.920]   All right, so--
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.860]   - That's why I'm the director of fun, all right, so--
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.220]   - What are the reasons that people come to you?
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.800]   What are some of the main reasons people come to you
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.260]   and say, I need an advisor, I wanna hire you?
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.260]   - Yeah, initially I definitely wanted to eviscerate this guy
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.080]   Benny Market style, but then I took a step back.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.580]   One, 'cause you told me I can't rip apart our viewers.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.340]   But secondly, because he's actually probably right, right?
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.720]   For the reasons that you mentioned.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.740]   If he was, he 33 years old, 27 years old.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.060]   This is one of the unfortunate truths in the industry, right?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.380]   It's like younger folk who don't have the investable assets
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.620]   could benefit from some holistic financial planning advice.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.740]   They can't find good advice.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.820]   The Northwestern Mutual guy is right around the corner,
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.660]   the insurance guy.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.940]   But other than that, there's really no good place to look.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.420]   So right now, what I would recommend to this nega Alex,
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.740]   this anti-advisor other Alex,
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.780]   is listen to RWM content, what she's doing, right?
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.740]   The fact that you're listening to Portfolio Rescue
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.940]   makes me believe you're probably are perfectly fine
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.500]   with whatever diversified index investing strategy
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.460]   you are in.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.660]   However, ways that a good advisor can help you
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.640]   even when you don't have a lot of investable assets,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.560]   but you have a high income earning,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.900]   financial goal planning, right?
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.100]   It's very helpful to set yourself up on a pad
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.500]   and not just invest blindly,
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.860]   having no idea what your short, intermediate,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.700]   long-term net worth is going to be.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.020]   When you can retire, when you can part-time work,
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.740]   can your wife dial it back?
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.820]   Education planning, if you wanna have kids.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.320]   Tax planning, not just filing taxes,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.740]   but the tax loss harvesting example I just mentioned, right?
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.860]   Also access to strategies that you can invest in on your own
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.280]   if the price is right.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.900]   Lastly, and I think this is important
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.460]   and I'm gonna get more nuanced than we typically get,
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.580]   behavioral assistance, but not in the sense like,
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.360]   did you panic in 2020?
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.980]   Did you buy crypto in 2020?
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.300]   Did you get meme stunked in 2021?
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.420]   Did you sell anything this year?
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.060]   But did you buy this year, right?
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.500]   Did you rebalance this year?
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.860]   Like those are things that they actually don't show up
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.860]   in time-weighted returns,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.800]   but they can really add to your bottom line
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.220]   if you do them correctly.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.300]   What you don't need is insurance planning,
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.440]   especially 'cause you don't have kids.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.900]   Like, you need insurance, but not insurance planning.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.820]   You don't need complex estate planning.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.620]   And then can I go a little in depth
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.180]   on like hiring an advisor real quick?
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.200]   - Yeah, but I mean, so one of the reasons
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.900]   that people come to us is because
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.100]   sometimes they wanna outsource it
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.580]   and then they just don't wanna do it themselves.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.240]   They have more important things to do with their time.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.180]   If you were interested in this stuff and you follow us,
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.260]   you probably are, then that's fine.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.740]   But it could come to a point of your life when you go,
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.340]   you know what?
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.740]   I've been doing this on my own the whole time.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.660]   My spouse doesn't pay attention to it as much as I do.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.580]   I'm worried if I got hit by a bus,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.420]   what's my spouse gonna do, right?
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.500]   - Contingency plan is good here.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.620]   Let me quantify for this here real quick, Benny Buckets.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.940]   All right, so let's say you spend
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.820]   three hours a week doing this, right?
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.660]   That seems reasonable
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.040]   if you're managing your own assets, right?
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.620]   Times 50, that's about 150 hours a year.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.580]   If this guy's in a sexy ass tax bracket
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.860]   looking for soft rumps,
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.140]   he's probably making at least $25 an hour, right?
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.060]   He probably values his time at $25 an hour.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.740]   I think that's a low number.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.840]   That's about $3,700 a year of his time
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.060]   that he's spending on managing his own finances.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.020]   Now, if you hire someone and pay them that exact fee,
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.780]   you're getting that value back.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.660]   And now that's assuming he can get the exact same returns
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.660]   and do the exact same processes and elite strategies
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.420]   that financial planning groups can give you.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.540]   So just assume that you can get a few basis points
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.620]   of value on top.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.940]   That's when you can start to quantify
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.340]   why someone in his situation would hire an advisor.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.380]   - I think what Alex is trying to say
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.500]   is that if you give him an email,
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.100]   he'll give you a 20 minute call
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.860]   about what it is to be an advisor
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.700]   and he'll walk you through.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.860]   And then when you're ready to hire an advisor,
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.420]   if you want to, go talk to him.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   - Do you value your time?
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   But to your point, Ben, and this is the last thing I have,
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.260]   there are those guys at Planet Fitness
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.660]   that pay $10 a month.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.800]   They are super jacked and they are an elite shape.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.860]   Like they don't need to hire a nutritionist
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.500]   or pay 200 bucks a month for CrossFit
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.720]   or do all these things.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.220]   There are the outliers,
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.740]   but those people, and just like the do-it-yourselfers
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.180]   who are 50 with 5 million bucks,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.260]   they're the outliers.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.020]   They're not the median or the mean, though.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.020]   - By the way, I used to have a membership
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.740]   at Planet Fitness, so thanks for that.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.860]   - Well, there can only be so many guys like me at the gym,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.500]   you know, but what I was gonna say is
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.340]   I feel like a lot of our audience
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.580]   are definitely more in the maybe inclined
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.660]   to be do-it-yourselfers, that kind of thing, right?
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.940]   They're watching financial content,
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.760]   they're trying to learn,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.980]   they're reading you guys' blogs and stuff.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.900]   And so, yeah, I feel like we might skew
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.740]   a little more that way,
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.100]   but yeah, I think the best explanation
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.040]   I have heard before is just when it's too complicated,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.740]   stressful, time-consuming, your situation,
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.700]   then that's the time maybe you would go to someone else.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.840]   - And if you're thinking about it,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.020]   there's nothing that can hurt from having a conversation,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.500]   and if you have a conversation
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.100]   and the financial advisor lays out
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.160]   all the things they can do for you,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.260]   which they should be doing,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.460]   these are the different things I will do for you,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.220]   if you don't think that those are worth the money,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.060]   then don't do it.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.160]   But you can at least have the conversation
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.020]   without completely handing over your life savings
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.740]   before beforehand, right?
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.580]   - Two other things.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.620]   - An hourly advisor is a good idea,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.720]   and paying a one-time financial planning fee
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.760]   is a good idea for these people.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.060]   - That's what I was about to ask you.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.860]   Can you explain to people how you're charged, typically?
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.340]   That's something I feel like no one really,
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.060]   I don't even quite understand.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.180]   - Yeah, so typically it's an AUM fee, right?
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.540]   Assets under management.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.200]   We charge you 50 basis points, 0.5% of your overall assets,
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.860]   and we do everything for you.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.100]   But for someone who has, it's actually,
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:34.940]   it's a good question.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.020]   For someone with like $50,000,
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.820]   if you charge them 50 basis points,
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.500]   that's $250 for the year.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.060]   Like, that's not a lot of money to pay for services,
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.640]   but you can pay, that's under the AUM model.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.480]   But younger people can pay,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.740]   "Hey, I'm gonna pay you 500 bucks to 1,000 bucks.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.580]   "Talk to me for an hour or two.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.240]   "Tell me what to do."
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.640]   The problem is you have to go and implement that yourself,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   but that can be really valuable
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.580]   if you do have the technical abilities
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.100]   to actually implement all of the things that I mentioned.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   And someone who's in their 30, 33 years old
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.420]   who's listening to Portfolio Rescue probably can.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.500]   And there's almost no doubt
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.280]   that if you go to the right place,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.540]   it's worth paying 500 bucks.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.540]   - By the way, and I also think it's okay.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.380]   Someone in the comments said,
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.380]   "I won't pay for a golf coach
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.420]   "that can't beat me on the course."
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.540]   And I haven't found one yet.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.020]   Tiger Woods has a golf coach, right?
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.740]   All the best golfers in the world have coaches.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.500]   Michael Jordan had trainers and coaches.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.100]   Even the best people know when to outsource.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.220]   So you just have to understand
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.820]   if outsourcing is right for you.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.540]   - Can you tell this guy to reach out to us
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.380]   so we can hire him?
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.620]   It sounds like he's really good at this.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.140]   - Can I follow up with one more question?
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.220]   Do you have one good red flag
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.780]   that someone should look out for
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.400]   if they're interviewing financial advisors?
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I already said it.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.060]   If you go to an advisory group or a financial planning company
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.060]   and during the first meeting, they mention insurance,
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.380]   that is a huge red flag, right?
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.020]   That's always a part of the puzzle,
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.780]   but that's never like, oh, you're 50 years old,
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.620]   you could really benefit
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.260]   from some indexed universal life insurance policy
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.140]   or, hey, you could really cover your spouse's income
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.260]   by buying this whole life.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.300]   That's the biggest red flag.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.540]   - Yeah, it shouldn't be selling you products,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.220]   it should be offering you solutions.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.220]   - Right. - So, yeah.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.700]   All right, Alex, after you get married,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.100]   you can come back and give us some advice financially
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.620]   on how to be a newlywed.

[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.020]   as Michael calls it, TCAF.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.140]   That hasn't, not growing on me yet, sorry.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.260]   - Yeah, I'm not 100% in on it.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.860]   - All right, keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.500]   Wanna thank Alex again for offering his advice today.
