[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.260]   Today, my guest is Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.720]   Dr. Conte is a psychiatrist who did his training
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960]   and then went on to be chief resident
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.320]   at Harvard Medical School.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.360]   He now runs the Pacific Premier Group,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.820]   which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.520]   focusing on solving complex human problems,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040]   including trauma, addiction, personality,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.960]   and psychiatric disorders.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.360]   Today, we discuss trauma in detail
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.920]   and the therapeutic process in detail.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   For instance, we discuss what is trauma?
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440]   How do you know if you have trauma?
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.340]   Dr. Conte shares with us, for instance,
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580]   that not every experience that we think is traumatic
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.920]   is necessarily traumatic,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.360]   and yet many people might have trauma
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   without even realizing it.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.280]   We also talk about the therapeutic process generally,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.160]   for instance, how to pick a therapist,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.500]   how to best approach and go through therapy,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.600]   and how to evaluate whether or not therapy
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.460]   and your relationship to the therapist is working or not.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.040]   We also talk about self-therapies
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.740]   because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620]   or can afford therapy.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.880]   And we talk about drug therapies,
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.920]   for instance, antidepressants, antipsychotics.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.240]   We talk about alcohol, cannabis, ketamine,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840]   and the psychedelics, including psilocybin, LSD,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440]   and we talk about the clinical use of MDMA
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   and what the future of that looks like.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.680]   The reason for bringing Dr. Conte onto this podcast
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.200]   is because I see him as the person
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.260]   who has the greatest and most holistic view of therapy,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.040]   trauma, drug therapies, talk therapies,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.520]   and how self-therapy and work with others can be integrated
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.860]   for both healing and growing from difficult circumstances.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.800]   Dr. Conte is also the author of an exceptional book
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.440]   entitled "Trauma, the Invisible Epidemic,
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   "How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It."
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.180]   That book describes trauma and its many features
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.820]   and many tools, some of which we discuss
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.320]   on the podcast today.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.100]   So whether or not you have trauma or not,
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.340]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.160]   you will have a much deeper understanding
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.760]   about what trauma is.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   In fact, I'm confident that you will gain insight
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.000]   into whether or not you have trauma or not,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240]   whether or not people close to you have trauma or not,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.280]   and the various paths to recovering
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   and indeed growing from trauma that we can all take.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.960]   As you will soon learn, Dr. Conte
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   is an exceptional communicator and has a unique window
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.780]   into the trauma and therapeutic process
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.240]   that I know that all of us can benefit from.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.760]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.540]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.000]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.600]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.440]   Our first sponsor is Roka.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.400]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   The company was founded by two
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.960]   all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.620]   and everything about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.940]   was designed with performance in mind.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.840]   I spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.100]   and I can tell you that our visual system
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.380]   has to contend with a lot of different challenges.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.500]   For instance, when you move from a shady area
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.020]   to a brightly lit area, your eyes and your brain
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.640]   have to adjust in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.780]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.060]   with the biology of the visual system in mind,
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.740]   so you never notice those transitions.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.680]   They're very seamless.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   You always see things with perfect clarity.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.440]   The other terrific thing about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.080]   is they are extremely lightweight.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.460]   Most of the time, I can't even remember
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.340]   that I'm wearing them.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.520]   I wear readers at night, and I wear sunglasses
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.860]   sometimes in the daytime when it is very bright
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.320]   or I'm driving and so on.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.600]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520]   go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.920]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.060]   to save 20% off on your first order.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.940]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.100]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.060]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.420]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.860]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.380]   to help you better understand your body
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.420]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.300]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.100]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.420]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.460]   can only be measured and assessed with a quality blood test.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.140]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.220]   we can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.540]   our biological age and see how that compares
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.060]   to our chronological age.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.980]   And of course, despite what our birthday cake
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.100]   screams back at us, it is our biological age
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.940]   that really matters.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.280]   If you're going to get blood tests or DNA tests, however,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.780]   you need to be able to interpret the data,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.940]   and that's really where Inside Tracker stands apart.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.700]   A lot of companies will give you a DNA test or a blood test,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.460]   they'll send you values of hormones, metabolic markers,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.700]   et cetera, but you don't know what to do with those data.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.920]   Inside Tracker is a very easy to use platform.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.860]   So when you get the numbers back,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.000]   you can click on any of the numbers that either are in range
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.260]   or out of range, too low, too high, et cetera,
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.180]   and it will direct you towards specific behavioral tools,
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.420]   so lifestyle factors, nutritional tools,
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.700]   supplement tools, et cetera,
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.860]   that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.180]   that are best for you, which is really an exceptional tool
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.420]   that makes all the blood tests and DNA tests
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.660]   really exceptionally powerful.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.060]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.660]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.420]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.300]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.180]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.260]   Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.180]   condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.460]   that you can read or listen to
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.540]   to extract the most important knowledge from those books.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.300]   I love reading physical books,
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.020]   literally physical hard copies of books,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.060]   and I like listening to audio books.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.660]   However, I also like to revisit books
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.100]   that I've read or listened to,
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.180]   and sometimes I just want to get the key points
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.620]   or the key takeaways from a book
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.640]   that I've never read or listened to.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.940]   Blinkist is terrific for all of that.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.220]   For instance, when researching our episodes on sleep,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.620]   one of the books that I read and found very valuable
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.920]   is Matt Walker, professor at UC Berkeley's book,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.140]   "Why We Sleep."
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.060]   I've read that book,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.640]   but then I wanted to also make sure
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.300]   that I hit the key takeaways.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.660]   Blinkist was essential for that.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.620]   Other books that I've read before and that I own and enjoy,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.380]   but I listened to the Blinkist version of from time to time
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.020]   are things like Tim Ferriss' "4-Hour Body,"
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.180]   or Tim Ferriss' "4-Hour Chef" book,
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.320]   both of which are excellent,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.700]   or Nassim Taleb's "The Black Swan,"
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.580]   and there are many other titles as well.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.700]   Blinkist is also a great way
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.120]   to finally get through many of the books
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.140]   that you've been meaning to read but haven't had time for.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.020]   With Blinkist, you get unlimited access
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.980]   to read or listen to a massive library
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.860]   of condensed nonfiction books.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.820]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.620]   just for our Huberman Lab podcast audience.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.020]   If you go to blinkist.com/huberman,

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.380]   blinkist.com/huberman to get 25% off
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.180]   and a seven-day free trial.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.820]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.780]   Paul, thank you so much for being here today.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.500]   - Well, thank you so much for having me.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.580]   - I've been looking forward to this,
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.220]   and I've received a ton of questions about trauma,
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.660]   about therapy, about how to assess where one is
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.560]   in their own arc of problems
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.580]   and addressing familial issues
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.620]   and relationship issues and so forth.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.060]   We could just start off very basic
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.700]   and just get everyone oriented.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.540]   - Sure.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.180]   - How should we define trauma?
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.340]   We all have hard experiences.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.780]   Some of them we might ruminate on more than others,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.740]   but what is trauma?
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.620]   - To make the definition relevant,
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.380]   I think we have to look at trauma
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.660]   as not anything negative that happens to us, right,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.980]   but something that overwhelms our coping skills
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.200]   and then leaves us different as we move forward.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.780]   So it changes the way that our brains function, right,
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.780]   and then that change is evident in us
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.560]   as we move forward through life.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.900]   - So how do we know if we have trauma or not?
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.820]   I've heard before, everyone has trauma.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.740]   For instance, I've heard that if we are a child
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.180]   or when we are a child and we request love from a parent
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.920]   or attention from a parent,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.220]   if they dismiss us, that that's a microtrauma.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.360]   Is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trauma?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.900]   Do we all have trauma?
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.140]   What are microtraumas?
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.540]   What are macrotraumas?
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.460]   - Right, I think traumas that we might categorize
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.940]   as disappointments, right,
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.220]   or things that are negative but not deeply impactful,
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.240]   I think is not a helpful definition, right?
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.220]   I think the helpful definition is something
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.760]   that rises to the magnitude of really changing us
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.420]   and something that we can see both in how we behave,
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.820]   we can see it in mood, anxiety, behavior,
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.020]   sleep, physical health, so we can identify it
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.540]   and we can also see it in brain changes.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.860]   So the fact that we become, say, more hypervigilant, right,
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.980]   more vigilant, and then we can see
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.540]   that different parts of the brain are more active.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.540]   So that definition, that definition captures how trauma,
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.460]   if it rises to a certain level,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.780]   like what we would say trauma
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.140]   that makes a post-trauma syndrome, right,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.540]   leaves us different, I think is the helpful definition
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.900]   of trauma because it's a clinical definition, right?
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.660]   It's changes in us as people and we can map those changes
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.940]   to identifiable shifts in our brain function.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.300]   - So how do we know if we've been changed by something?
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.420]   I mean, I can think back to childhood events
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.380]   where some kid on the playground or in the classroom
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.820]   said something I didn't like, something negative about me.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.060]   I think most people can do that.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.100]   We have a great memory for the kid that said something awful
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   or the parent or teacher that said something awful
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.740]   that really felt like it hurt us
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.500]   or at least it stuck with us.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.460]   So clearly one's brain, my brain in this example,
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.040]   has been changed by that event such that I remember it.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.560]   But how do we know if something has actually changed
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.600]   the way that we are because of course,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.620]   we don't know how we would be otherwise?
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.500]   - Right, that's difficult, right?
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.100]   It's doable, but it's difficult because the response.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.300]   So if the trauma rises to the level of changing our brains,
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.700]   and I don't just mean like we have a new memory, right?
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.300]   So we can have memories of something that was negative,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.980]   and in that sense, it changes the brain
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.600]   because now there's something we can call to mind,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.740]   but it doesn't change the functioning of the brain.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.740]   If trauma rises to the level of changing the functioning
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.140]   of our brains, then there's almost always a reflex
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.700]   of guilt and shame around the trauma that can lead us
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.900]   and often leads us to bury it, to avoid it,
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.420]   to feel that now there's something negative inside of me
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.160]   and it feels shameful or it feels like no one else
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.740]   would accept it, right?
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.200]   So what happens is people tend to avoid looking
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.580]   at the change in them, which is exactly the opposite
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.800]   of what needs to be done, right?
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.940]   The idea of in a viral pandemic, right?
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.740]   We wanna stay away from one another and isolate, right?
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.340]   But with the trauma epidemic,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.140]   we need to communicate with other people.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.020]   We need to communicate and put words
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.900]   to what's gone on inside of us.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   And very often a person knows, I mean,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.760]   I've done so much clinical work over about 20 years
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.380]   that has focused on trauma and a lot of the times
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.280]   the person knows, right?
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.100]   But they're not admitting it to themselves
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.260]   because they're afraid of it, right?
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.540]   They don't know what to do, but if they start talking,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.260]   then they'll talk about the event or the situation.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.140]   It could be something acute or it could be something chronic
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.260]   that really has been harmful to them, right?
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.380]   And then they feel different afterwards.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.820]   Like, oh, after that, I started thinking differently,
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.460]   feeling differently, but that doesn't always happen.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.900]   Sometimes it's a process of exploration through dialogue,
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.060]   right, whether it's written or whether it's spoken
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.300]   of the person sort of exploring the changes
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.780]   inside of themselves, maybe changes to their self-talk
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.300]   inside, changes to their thoughts about the world
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.780]   and whether they can navigate safely and readily in it.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.200]   And it anchors, as I talk about this,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.700]   the example I'll use at times is the example
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.620]   of my own life where, you know, when I was much younger,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.900]   in my early 20s, my younger brother took his life
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.220]   by suicide and, you know, the response of guilt and shame
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.140]   and hiding all of it inside of me was,
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.140]   it's just very dramatic, but I wasn't acknowledging it,
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.820]   right, 'cause I didn't know what to do about it
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.340]   and I felt guilty and I felt responsible
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.460]   and I felt ashamed, so there was an avoidance inside of me.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.500]   And then I wasn't saying to myself, hey, before this,
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.060]   you thought that you could be effective
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.460]   and you could make your way in the world
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.060]   and, you know, if you were a good person
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.500]   and you worked hard, you could make a difference, right?
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.600]   And then afterwards, I thought, I can't get anywhere,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.820]   the world's against me and, you know,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.500]   I felt like, oh, my options are all gone
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.540]   and, you know, I was like 24 years old, right?
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.020]   So I didn't see that the change was in me,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.420]   but I was taking care of myself poorly,
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.940]   like there was enough going on that was unhealthy
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.100]   that I couldn't avoid the realization that like,
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   hey, I'm different now and in these ways
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.780]   that are automatic, you know, my reflex to,
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.900]   can I make my way in the world?
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.940]   Can I have a good life?
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.780]   Can I be happy?
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.260]   Well, my reflexes to that were all different
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260]   and they were coming through the lens of heightened anxiety,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.780]   heightened vigilance, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame,
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.300]   and a sense of non-belonging in the world
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.480]   and was ultimately good and helpful people around me
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.940]   and my own realization and hey,
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.540]   things are not going well, right,
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.500]   that led me to then get some help
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.700]   and to be able to talk about it and realize like,
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.820]   oh, my gosh, I need to face these things
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.940]   that are going on inside of me.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.520]   - From a psychoanalytic, psychological,
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.340]   and maybe even a neuroscience perspective, two questions.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.980]   Why do you think that when we experience trauma,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.260]   these things that we call guilt and shame surface,
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.220]   you know, everything you're telling me is that
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.500]   in the end, that's not adaptive.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.280]   Why would we be built that way?
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.460]   So that's the first question.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.500]   And then the second question is, you know,
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.160]   how should we conceptualize, you know, guilt and shame?
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.220]   You know, I think that we hear guilt, we hear shame,
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.580]   you know, how should we think about it?
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.580]   I mean, those emotions must exist in us for some reason,
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.300]   but in this case, it seems like they don't serve us well.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.020]   So maybe in that order or in reverse order, you know,
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.580]   what is guilt really?
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.060]   What is shame really?
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.760]   And why is it that we seem to be reflexively wired
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.900]   to feel guilty and feel ashamed when that's
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.460]   the exact opposite of what we need to do
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.860]   in the case of trauma?
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.700]   - Right, right.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.120]   No, I think these are great questions.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.220]   And I mean, I don't think anyone knows the answers for sure,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.860]   but my read of all of that is that there's something adaptive
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.900]   that has happened in us through evolution
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.820]   that now becomes maladaptive
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.460]   in the way we live in the modern world, right?
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.940]   So if you think of, through most of human development,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.540]   you know, people weren't living that long, right?
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.320]   And the idea was to survive and reproduce.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.560]   So traumatic things that happened to us,
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.580]   it would make sense for them to stay with us, right?
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.580]   So, you know, if you ate a new food
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.140]   and got really, really sick,
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.540]   it's like, you better remember that, right?
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.500]   You know, if you see someone from the group of people,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.240]   you know, a couple miles away, right?
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.260]   And one of those people attacks you, right?
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.160]   It's like, you better remember that.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.860]   So the traumatic things that are sort of emblazoned
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.740]   in our brain are built to last, right?
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.140]   Things that are positive
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.260]   will generate some emotion inside of us,
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.400]   but things that are profoundly negative
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.700]   are much more likely to stay with us.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.220]   And I think that that was adaptive, right?
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.020]   When all of that was about survival, right?
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.740]   And I think the same thing is true with, say, shame, right?
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.140]   So I think here it makes sense to talk a little bit,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.100]   and actually I'm interested in your thoughts about this,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.640]   right, that the limbic system, right,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.300]   so the system often is called the emotion system, right,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.260]   in our brains, has actually, of course, varying function,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.500]   right, and one aspect is affect, right?
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.300]   So affect is aroused in us,
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.740]   which I think the meaning then is,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.700]   it's created in us without our choice, right?
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.180]   So if we're walking down the road
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.220]   and someone jumps in front of us or pushes us, right,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.260]   then there's a response of fear, anger, right?
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.320]   Heart starts beating faster, more blood to the muscles,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.940]   we're getting ready to fight, right, or run, right?
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.440]   And then we become aware of it, right?
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   So the aroused affect in us is also about survival,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.060]   and it has a very deep impact upon us,
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.980]   and shame is an aroused affect.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.300]   So it can be raised in us without our choice,
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.220]   and it's very powerful, which if you think about that,
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.200]   is an extremely strong deterrent, right?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.660]   So if you had, you know, imagine a tribe or a group of people
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.960]   right, that are sheltered together and, you know,
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.180]   someone eats half the food at night or something, right?
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.020]   And like, there's a very negative response, right,
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.420]   and that person feels shame because shame is so powerful
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.340]   to control behavior, right?
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.580]   So the way that trauma can change our brains
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.620]   and stay with us in a way that says, be more vigilant,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.460]   look at the world in a different way,
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.500]   act more defensively, right?
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.940]   And how that links to shame and to guilt.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.740]   So then guilt becomes what gets called feeling technically,
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.940]   where we relate the aroused affect to ourselves, right?
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   So shame, the aroused affect, and guilt, the next step,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.820]   right, when the shame gets related to self,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.120]   are such profound behavioral interventions and deterrents,
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.460]   right, that you can see, I think, how evolutionarily
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.680]   kind of all makes sense.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.700]   If we're fighting for survival, you know,
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.820]   and we're an elder statesman, if we make it to 20, right,
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.920]   this makes sense, but it doesn't make sense
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.560]   in a world where we live much longer, right?
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.080]   We navigate in all sorts of different ways,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.180]   and there's so much coming at us that can be traumatizing.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.860]   I mean, if you think about the news, right?
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.060]   I mean, how many times have I written a prescription
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.220]   for someone that says, no more news, right?
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.540]   - You've actually written those prescriptions?
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.900]   - Oh yeah, yes.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.940]   So glance at the news, like look at the news for news.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.840]   Anything going on, I need to know, right?
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.860]   But what are people doing is they're looking at it
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.100]   and they're clicking and they're clicking,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.620]   and there's a sense of being like enthralled
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.760]   in a very frightening way with the horrors
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.220]   that are in front of us.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.420]   And it shows how, yes, trauma can come
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.900]   through acute things that happen to us.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.500]   Trauma can come through chronic things,
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.880]   chronic denigration, whether it's based
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.660]   upon socioeconomic status, immigration status,
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.820]   race, religion, sexuality, gender identity,
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   these chronic traumas, right, of being denigrated
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.580]   by the society around us or treated as less than
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.600]   can change the brain.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.660]   But vicarious experiences can too, right?
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.620]   And we know this, it's not theoretical.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.780]   We know that the changes in the brain can come
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.660]   from vicarious experiences too, which is why people
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.620]   who are glued to the news and then feeling like,
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.500]   oh my goodness, like what is happening?
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.100]   You know, the mothers in the Ukraine who've, you know,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.180]   lost babies in the war, and like there are things
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.660]   that are so terrifying that if we spend so much time
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.740]   with that, it has a similar effect.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.400]   So our brains are built to change from trauma,
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.380]   but not in the way we experience trauma
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.660]   and not in the way that we live life in terms
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.620]   of the nature of living life and the duration of life
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.100]   in the modern world where these traumas that happen
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.460]   to us are often so bad for us because they change
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.380]   how our brain is functioning and then our entire orientation
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.900]   to the world is different.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.780]   And that could be for, you know, years and years
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.600]   and decades and decades.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.180]   It brings so much misery and suffering.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.000]   And at times it brings death.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.420]   If you think about a hundred thousand overdose deaths
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.100]   in this country in a year, a hundred thousand,
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.540]   where is so much of that arising from?
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.640]   As a person who's treated addiction very intensively
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.700]   over many years, I think that, well, I feel sure
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.700]   that the majority of addiction that I see and treat arises
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.340]   ultimately the roots of it are in trauma
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.300]   and are in trying to soothe something that's stuck inside
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.460]   that the person isn't letting outside because of the guilt
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.460]   and shame, but it's running around in their head
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.820]   and they're tormented by it.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.180]   And now there's a pull for these drugs
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.680]   or sometimes medicines to soothe.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.980]   So, you know, the opiates that were given
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.900]   after a minor surgery, right, are like, okay, yeah,
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.540]   they help the pain from the minor surgery,
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.700]   but what they're really helping is the pain inside, right?
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.740]   But that very quickly turns into addiction, danger, risk.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.180]   And we see that over and over again
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.780]   and not in a theoretical way.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.220]   Like I see that in people who have been in my practice
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.880]   with addiction arising from trauma
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.580]   who have subsequently died.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.940]   So it's sort of writ large in our existence
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.540]   in the modern world.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.180]   - Incredible to me that this is the way it works.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.660]   And what I mean by that is this idea
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.900]   that I've heard about before,
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.860]   I think it was a Freudian concept of a repetition compulsion
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.140]   that, you know, this is what boggles my mind
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.540]   as I'm hearing this.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.780]   Something happens to us or we observe something traumatic.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.260]   And instead of acknowledging that
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.800]   and trying to distance from it,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.180]   there seems to be a reflex of shame and guilt in many cases
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.160]   and stuffing it away.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.140]   And then a repetition of behaviors
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.760]   to continue to try and to stuff it away.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.840]   Like you're trying to pack, I don't know,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.140]   recently I was packing a home
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.100]   and trying to get a sleeping bag back into the bag.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.940]   It seems like it's always trying to mushroom out the top.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.780]   This kind of thing.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.660]   It takes a lot of ongoing effort.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.500]   And at the same time that if this thing really exists,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.140]   this repetition compulsion,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.140]   people will return over and over again
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.620]   to the kinds of scenarios
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.240]   or at least the kinds of emotional states
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.620]   that look just like the trauma or resemble it in some way.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.380]   So the question I have for you is,
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.880]   is the repetition compulsion a real thing?
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.420]   And why would we be wired that way?
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.180]   My understanding of this concept
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.300]   of the repetition compulsion
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.700]   is that we all want to solve our traumas
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.780]   and it allows us to put ourselves into micro
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.980]   or again, macro versions of that over and over again.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.020]   We get to run the experiment again and again
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.900]   in an attempt to solve it.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.900]   In the case of taking a drug that it's clear,
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.240]   certain drugs like opioids,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.340]   it's clear how that would not allow us to deal with it.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.220]   It's just masking the emotional state.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.980]   But why is it, for instance,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.220]   that somebody who experiences sexual trauma
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.600]   then places themselves into circumstances
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.020]   of more sexual trauma?
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.380]   Why is it that somebody who is in an abusive relationship
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.860]   goes on to have a second and third or fourth
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.300]   verbally or physically abusive relationship?
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.140]   Yeah, I mean, on the face of it,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.820]   you just go, that makes no sense.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.540]   And yet we see this over and over and over again.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.380]   - Yes.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.540]   The first thing I would say about the validity
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:50.540]   of the repetition compulsion concept is a strong yes.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.560]   Like, yes, we see that over and over.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.700]   It's not necessarily in everyone,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.380]   but boy, it is in a lot of people who have suffered trauma.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.920]   And I think there's a very good reason.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.340]   On the surface of it, it's like, it makes no sense.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.860]   But then if we think, well,
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.140]   how does our brains actually function, right?
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.700]   We're sort of trained, at least in Western society,
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.900]   I think, to think of ourselves as logical creatures, right?
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.300]   That like, oh, we're logical
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.640]   and ultimately everything in us
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.060]   can just boil down to logic.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.760]   And if we think about it enough,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.200]   we're gonna understand how to make the right decisions,
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.760]   which is completely not true, right?
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.620]   That the limbic system, right?
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.520]   The emotion system, so to speak, inside of us
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.140]   always trumps logic, right?
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.960]   If you think about, does it ever make sense
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.620]   to run into a burning building?
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.640]   I mean, logic says no, right?
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.340]   But if someone you love is in the burning building,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.000]   people run right in, right?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.260]   Because the limbic system says yes.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.580]   So when logic and emotion come head to head,
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.160]   emotion wins all the time.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.520]   If emotion is powerful enough, it will always win.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.620]   And so the limbic system is so important
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.900]   and the limbic system does not care
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.440]   about the clock or the calendar, right?
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.600]   And that's the answer.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.540]   And I'll sort of say why to the repetition compulsion.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.660]   So the limbic system doesn't know like,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.300]   oh, it's now, it's today, it's May, it's 2022.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.220]   It just doesn't care at all, right?
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.380]   So how I would relate that to the repetition compulsion
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.740]   is when people are repeating, what they're trying to do
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.140]   is to make things right, right?
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.260]   With the idea that if we can repeat the situation
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.800]   and make it right, it will fix everything, right?
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.360]   Which makes perfect sense if we think,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.800]   well, where is that concept coming from, right?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.620]   It's coming from the emotional part of the brain
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.620]   that wants relief from suffering of the trauma
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.860]   and does not understand the clock or the calendar.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.220]   So if I can solve something now,
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.160]   I will also solve something in the past, right?
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.580]   Which is why I can't tell you how many times
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.940]   I've sat with someone and say,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.100]   we're starting to do therapy, right?
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.500]   And a person will say, oh, gosh, like, I know,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.020]   look, look, you just can't help me, right?
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   I mean, you know, my last seven relationships
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.620]   have been abusive, right?
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.320]   And I'll say back something sometimes like,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.680]   well, look, if you tell me that you've had seven relationships
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.920]   that have been abusive in different ways,
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.760]   I'll agree with you.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.600]   Like, I only say that
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.160]   'cause that's never what someone says, right?
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.720]   But I think what you're gonna tell me
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.400]   is you've kind of had the same relationship seven times.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.860]   It's not seven things, it's one, right?
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.120]   And that's always, I don't think one time yet
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.920]   that has failed to be the case.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.720]   And that's how, so if you think about it,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.240]   that's how we start to elucidate what's going on.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.260]   So the light bulb that goes off,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.100]   like I have not had seven different abusive relationships.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.280]   I have had one that I have repeated seven times.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.840]   And now we start getting to what's really going on
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.940]   and what needs to happen.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.800]   That person needs to face what happened
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.720]   in that original abusive relationship.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.880]   And it always comes down to the same sort of concepts
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.320]   of the person feeling terrified
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.820]   while the abuse was going on,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.080]   feeling guilty, feeling ashamed,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.040]   feeling like, oh, they brought it on themselves,
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.640]   they deserve it, they don't deserve anything better, right?
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.440]   Because the brain is trying to make sense of it, right?
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.560]   Or I thought I could make that okay, but I couldn't, right?
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.820]   And then there's more guilt and more shame.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.260]   And if that's stuck inside of someone,
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.600]   like that's bundled up inside of someone,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.380]   you know, like a medical abscess inside a person,
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.000]   you know, a walled off infection inside the body,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.740]   this is the same concept in the brain,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.260]   then of course the limbic system is gonna wanna fix that.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.780]   And it fixes it by trying to let's recreate that situation
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.560]   and make it right this time.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.220]   And that's, I mean, it's I think one of the best examples
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.280]   of how the right approach of how like, let's look at that,
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.820]   let's talk about that, right?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.920]   What's really going on there?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.560]   Wait, who should feel guilty and ashamed?
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   Is it the person who was abused
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.060]   or the person who was abusing, right?
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.840]   And we can get at what's going on inside the person
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.160]   and that's what changes that.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.640]   And then the eighth relationship can be entirely different
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.040]   than the first seven, right?
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.400]   And I see that all the time.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.820]   I mean, this isn't esoteric or soft.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.380]   Like I see that play out clinically over and over again.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.740]   And why do things get better?
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.460]   Because we go to the trauma and we unlock it.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.020]   It's not hidden inside where it can control things, right?
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.340]   We bring it to the surface
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.000]   and then we can take away its power.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.620]   - I keep hearing in this narrative
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.620]   that so much of our reflexive response to trauma,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.580]   both emotional and the repetition compulsion
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.380]   in terms of behaviors is about some very deep attempt
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.940]   to change the past.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.080]   - Yes.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.940]   - And in fact, in an offline conversation,
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.380]   I recall you saying something about this,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.160]   that the number of behaviors and thoughts
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.200]   and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.460]   that human beings put in to try and change the past
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.460]   is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive, it sounds like.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.940]   And that really stuck with me
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.940]   because I think we all want to feel
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.140]   like we're in control of our future
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.100]   and how we feel in the moment.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.260]   And to some extent it works for a brief while.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.900]   You know, there's this thing that happened
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.500]   and it just evokes some internal arousal
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.980]   and then you have to know what to do with that arousal.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.580]   And I think for many people, including myself,
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.940]   there's this fundamental question,
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.740]   okay, the thought about the thing, the event,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.780]   or events, plural, evokes this arousal,
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.940]   this internal state makes some people feel sleepy
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.580]   and exhausted, other people feel really anxious,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.700]   other people feel angry.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.420]   I mean, arousal has all these different dimensions
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.000]   as you know.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.260]   And then there's this question about what to do with it.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:57.260]   And I'd love to hear maybe even just a top contour
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.340]   prescriptive of what does one do?
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.260]   I'll even just put myself in it, what do I do?
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.140]   So I'm feeling upset about something.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.020]   I feel like my options are healthy catharsis.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.960]   I can tell the story, feel it.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.620]   I can pack it down.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.300]   We hear that it's bad to pack it down,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.320]   but of course one has to be functional in life
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.620]   and deal with things.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.900]   And we have responsibilities at work
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.720]   and relational responsibilities, et cetera.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.920]   We need to sleep at night.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.980]   So catharsis, healthy catharsis,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.360]   packing it down at the other extreme.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.880]   Telling the story.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.020]   And yet I think a lot of people are afraid to tell the story
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.200]   because it's in that telling,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.320]   there's a perhaps a re-emergence of the arousal.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.640]   The arousal can become greater.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.780]   I mean, is that what people mean when they say
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.580]   things are going to get worse before they get better?
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.760]   I mean, so I guess the simple version
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.000]   of this long-winded question is it's clear
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.040]   we need to confront these things.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.200]   We can't change the past by a reflexive response
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.040]   isn't going to do that efficiently.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.180]   And so how do we deal with arousal?
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.460]   How does one take what they feel inside
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.160]   about something shameful?
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.440]   What do you do with it in a moment?
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.460]   And does that have to be done in the presence
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.520]   of a skilled trained therapist?
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.500]   Or as I'm driving to work in the morning
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.240]   and something comes up,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.640]   I can't deal with this right now, comes to mind,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.480]   what do I do?
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.840]   Do I deal with it right then?
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.720]   I know this is a big multi-dimensional question,
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.040]   but I think it's the one that a lot of people grapple with.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.000]   We want to deal with things.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.640]   How do we deal with that internal arousal?
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   We so often try and change the trauma of the past
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.080]   in order to control the future.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.600]   And what that really adds up to
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.860]   is the trauma of the past dominates our present, right?
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.760]   And it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.900]   And remember, we're talking about traumas
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.080]   that rise to the level of changing the brain.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.580]   So as you're saying, that involves re-experience.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.600]   It involves hypervigilance, increased arousal.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.120]   It changes in mood states, changes in anxiety,
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.440]   changes in sleep, changes in behavior.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   So these are all changes that, in a sense,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.360]   push towards dominating our present, right?
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.600]   And then we're not really living in the present, right,
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.380]   as we're trying to control the future.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.780]   We're not gonna do a great job of controlling our future
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.720]   if we're not really living in the present, right?
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.320]   And so the way to come at that,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.800]   and again, in the moment, if we're saying,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.280]   okay, in the moment, if I need to fall asleep, right,
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.040]   I might say, okay, let me try and put that out of my mind.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.260]   Let me try and thought redirect.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.220]   So there's short-term strategies
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.560]   that can let us be functional
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.440]   in the context of these changes.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   But the answer is to go look directly at that thing, right?
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.880]   Look at that trauma, explore that trauma.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.640]   And sure, that can be done with a professional,
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.780]   and sometimes that's what makes sense.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.140]   But not always, right?
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.880]   Sometimes it can be done by talking to another person,
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.480]   right, writing it down, right?
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.820]   Look at what's going on inside of me
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.560]   that my mind is so stuck to this.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.720]   Let's explore that.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   Because it's almost as if we're so afraid so often
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.700]   of looking at the trauma that has changed us
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.480]   that we'll look anywhere but at that, right?
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.080]   So it's like it's hidden in a closet
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.060]   and we'll shine the light everywhere else,
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.980]   but we're not gonna open that door.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.380]   And that's where people will say the same as I've heard
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.680]   over and over, and I myself have thought this at times,
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.160]   like, oh, if I talk about that,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.100]   I'm gonna start crying and never stop, right?
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.120]   Or I'm gonna just fall apart, right?
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.000]   Which is never what happens.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.520]   No one ever starts crying and never stops, right?
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.320]   What ends up happening is when the person puts words to it,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.600]   right, it could be in writing,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.480]   it could be talking to a trusted other or with a therapist,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.080]   right, things start to change.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.840]   I mean, just the fact that you can talk about it,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.900]   you can put words to it and other people don't recoil, right?
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.460]   I mean, how many times has someone said something
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.680]   for the first time, right?
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.320]   And when they're telling me about the trauma,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.560]   there's such an anxious looking like as if
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.240]   I'm gonna recoil from it, right?
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.040]   Meaning I'm going to recoil from them, right?
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.480]   And then there's a sense of surprise if the person says,
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   well, I was abused by this coach when I was a kid, right?
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   And there's not, okay, there's not a response of recoiling.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   You can see the change and people will say a lot like,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.720]   wow, I can't believe you can hear me say that
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.420]   and be okay with it, right?
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.480]   I mean, so you think about what's going on inside of them,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.440]   like what a sense of shame, a sense of,
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   this is something awful about me for people to recoil from.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.200]   And it's just not true, but here's where trauma is,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.840]   it's insidious, right?
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.140]   And it's pervasive, right?
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:50.640]   Because if that convinces us to continually hide it away,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.040]   then how do we explore it?
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.480]   Like that example of the person who says,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.080]   okay, I was abused by a coach when I was a child.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.320]   I mean, I'm thinking of a couple very real cases, right?
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.840]   People that I've taken care of.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.760]   And once they start talking about it,
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.760]   then they start talking about how,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.920]   you know, they were just innocent kids, right?
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.120]   Like they didn't know.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.780]   And like, they really wanted to be on the team
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.840]   where this coach was treating them as special.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.480]   And now they can look at themselves from the outside, right?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.680]   They can look at themselves
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.420]   like they would look at someone else, right?
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.760]   You think it's so easy for us to see what's real and true
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.080]   if it's someone else, right?
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.920]   If you ask someone,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.880]   what do you think of someone who's 10, 11 years old,
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.840]   who's abused and manipulated and abused by an adult?
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.720]   We say, oh my goodness,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.120]   I feel compassion for that person, right?
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.100]   But if it's us, right?
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.080]   Then, oh no, it's guilt and shame
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.480]   and we have to hide it away.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.240]   And when the person starts looking at it,
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   they can sort of see it from the outside
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.140]   and it starts to take the energy out of it, right?
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.000]   Then, well, who should feel guilty about that?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.580]   Who's done something wrong?
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.960]   And like, so now the conceptions come together,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.740]   which is often a reflexive, that was my fault.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.580]   Oh, I did it.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.040]   I went back to it.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.880]   I still stayed on the team.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.480]   I went back next season, right?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.920]   I let it happen again.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.340]   But all the guilt and shame inside the person
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.920]   gets juxtaposed to like, what really happened there?
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.120]   And then they say, right, I was a terrified child, right?
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.640]   I didn't understand at all.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.920]   And they can come to a place of compassion
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.600]   and now we are working against the guilt and shame.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.160]   And if the person cries about it, that's great, right?
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.400]   I mean, crying is one of the best coping mechanisms
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.240]   we have.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   It doesn't hurt us and it lets us grieve things.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.520]   We can't grieve if there's guilt and shame inside of us.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.520]   It just blocks grief, right?
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.960]   We have to, it has to be a clean slate, in a sense,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.800]   in order to feel sadness.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.640]   And then you see that it shifts from anxiety,
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.440]   anger and frustration, usually directed towards the self,
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.680]   guilt and shame, towards being able to process it
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.020]   and being able to bring to bear some compassion
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.680]   and being able to direct the negative emotion,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.120]   so to speak, where they're warranted.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.080]   And my goodness, the changes that happen.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.000]   I mean, it's not like people are miraculously cured, right?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.480]   But it's remarkable how just getting it out there
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.180]   and having like one hour of talking like that,
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.760]   like what we're talking about now, can leave a person
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.360]   feeling immensely better.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.700]   - It seems to me in hearing this,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.240]   that there's this weird wiring that we have.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.160]   Because what I'm hearing is when traumas happen to us
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.340]   or we observe them, what we need to do most
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.360]   is to confront those and the emotions around that directly.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.840]   But instead, our system defaults to guilt and shame
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.360]   and trying to hide it.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.540]   And this repetition compulsion of placing us back
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.600]   into things similar to those traumas,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.240]   or even maybe even worse traumas in an attempt to resolve it.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.920]   It's like the most maladaptive wiring diagram
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.340]   I could possibly think of.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.780]   Emotional and presumably physiological wiring diagram.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.920]   And this notion of trying to change the past
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.900]   by doing things now when the exact opposite
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.880]   is what's going to be beneficial,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.200]   also seems like the whole system seems completely backwards.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.400]   And I'm chuckling, as I said, it's not because I'm amused,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.240]   it's because I'm just baffled once again
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.260]   at how our wiring can often not serve us well.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.840]   But it raises what I think is an important
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.080]   and interesting question, which is earlier,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.800]   you were talking about how people will seek out media
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   that's really disturbing.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.180]   They'll traumatize and re-traumatize themselves
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.780]   on a daily basis.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.460]   So that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.900]   where the person will have the same relationship
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.520]   with seven different, same abusive relationship
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.660]   with seven different partners in sequence.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.420]   Seems terrible.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.540]   And yet, as I say this, it also is becoming clear to me
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.480]   how this almost seems like a poor but desperate attempt
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.180]   to resolve it in some way.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.920]   And so the fork in the road, if I understand correctly,
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.480]   is to really get to the seed incident,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.640]   really get to the thing that started it all,
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.040]   as opposed to repeating it all. - Yes.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.800]   - Does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist?
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.980]   Is there a benefit to taking a walk
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.900]   and thinking about these things,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.120]   breaking down and crying if that's what's necessary,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.720]   or feeling angry if that's what comes up?
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   The reason I ask it this way is because I worry,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.180]   I'll just speak to my own experience,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.240]   I worry that in reactivating
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.740]   or touching into the emotions around something,
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.600]   that that is itself a form of the repetition compulsion,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.060]   because you're feeling it all over again.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.580]   You're not seeking out something to evoke that feeling.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.940]   So I realize this is a little bit
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.700]   of a circular argument or question,
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.660]   but I think it's one that I really struggle with
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:57.140]   in trying to parse all the outcome-based therapies
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:03.940]   that I hear about and the recommendations
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.780]   that people make.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.680]   I mean, how should we conceptualize this?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.020]   Something happens.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.400]   Sounds like we need to deal with that thing directly.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   Do we need to do that with somebody else?
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.480]   Can we do that on our own?
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.100]   If we don't have resources
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.140]   and we have to do it on our own,
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.940]   can't hire someone, can't pay someone to work with us,
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.940]   how do we do that in a way that isn't retraumatizing
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.140]   ourself in a major way or in a minor way?
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.680]   How do we know where we are in that landscape?
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.640]   - Right.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.620]   Again, those are, I think, great questions,
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.440]   and I think it starts with real introspection.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.060]   When things are bouncing around in our minds,
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.380]   often it's very non-productive.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.020]   It's the same thing over and over again,
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.140]   and that's not helpful for us.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.380]   So there's an idea which sometimes gets called
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.060]   an observing ego, the ability to stop
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.580]   and look at what's going on inside of ourselves.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.260]   And so if we're just thinking about it
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.120]   and we're thinking in the same way we sort of,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.880]   in a sense, always think about it,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.540]   then all we're doing is reinforcing the trauma.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.900]   But if we can distance enough to be like,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.500]   huh, I'm interested in what's going on inside of me, right?
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.860]   Like I think of a certain person who really loves music.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.900]   And then at some point in our therapy work,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.160]   I learned, like, she was taking long drives,
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.820]   but the radio wasn't on.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.540]   And I was like, well, what's going on, right?
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.540]   And I asked, and what was going on?
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.700]   And she was running over and over again in her head,
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.740]   like, I'm a loser, I'm a loser, right?
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.900]   And she didn't want the music on
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.900]   because the music would drown out what she felt
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.120]   she had to say to herself, right?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.780]   And it was that like, wow, that's interesting, right?
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.220]   And then her ability to observe that and to think,
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.660]   why am I doing that when it comes into her mind?
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.020]   Like, what is that trace to?
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.340]   When did I start doing that?
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.380]   Like I said, I'm saying it for a point of exaggeration,
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.380]   like nobody comes out of the womb,
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.700]   programmed to think I'm a loser, right?
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.500]   So we don't think that when we're born, right?
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.340]   So where does that come from?
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.420]   Then we can think in ways
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.180]   that allow us to have new thoughts, right?
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.140]   That we weren't having.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.420]   It's not just bouncing around in our minds.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.660]   And if we speak or write,
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.180]   there are even more mechanisms
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.300]   that come online in our brains, right?
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.220]   That are then sort of monitoring mechanisms.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.140]   We think in a different way if we're using words, right?
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.700]   And we are better able often
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.300]   to bring in that observing ego,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.780]   like what's going on inside of me.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.260]   So it can be very helpful to think,
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.880]   it can be helpful to talk to someone,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.620]   to a trusted other, friend, family, clergy, to write.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.500]   I mean, these are things that can be done
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.840]   without expending any resources, right?
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.180]   And sometimes it can make really a big difference, right?
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.800]   There's a way, when did I start thinking that?
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.300]   And like interestingly in this case,
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.880]   okay, we did it in therapy,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.780]   but it became very clear what that was rooted to, right?
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.780]   And then in the therapy, which was still relatively young,
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.540]   but we'd done several sessions
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.380]   and we weren't talking at all
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.180]   about what we needed to talk about, right?
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.280]   But that's what got us to what we needed to talk about.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.480]   And when did that start?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.740]   And now we're in that same place of exploring that.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.280]   And what was the reflex to it?
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.500]   And the sense of guilt and sense of shame.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.400]   And it's where all of that came from
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.020]   that just got boiled down to I'm a loser, right?
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.300]   Which this person didn't even have in their mind.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.080]   Like I didn't think about myself that way, right?
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.640]   And it's so interesting, right?
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.820]   That our memories don't in and of themselves have meaning.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.940]   It's like they're flat or colorless, right?
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.400]   And they're colored in by the emotions
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.060]   that we attach to them, right?
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   So the idea that certain memories now before the trauma
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.660]   were changed, right, by the trauma.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.900]   So I tell the story sometimes of a person
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.040]   who like won an award when they were in high school
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.180]   that they thought was, oh my gosh, like it shows,
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.520]   like I can do it, right?
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.900]   And get out there that after trauma,
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.900]   they saw the award with a negative emotion attached to it
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.340]   that was like, oh, it was given to me
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.340]   and I didn't deserve it.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.820]   And almost it was mocking.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.060]   Like there's gonna be the greatest achievement of my life
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.500]   and I was 17 or so.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.020]   And to have someone think like that's not how they felt
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.900]   about that at the time, it's the trauma that changed
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.980]   the self-talk, the internal state going forward.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.240]   And you're talking about miraculous in a negative way,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.260]   also change that going backward, right?
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.020]   And when we can really look at like,
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.460]   where did that come from?
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.860]   And we can start unraveling it, it changes.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.580]   So in those cases, often it's helpful
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.500]   to have a good therapist.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.180]   It's not always necessary and it certainly,
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.840]   it's not always possible, right?
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.080]   So we need other strategies.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.620]   And some of those, I write about some of those in the book
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.180]   of how can we sort of get at trauma
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.220]   without those formalized mechanisms?
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.660]   And sometimes if the symptoms are significant enough,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.140]   like we really do need to talk to somebody professional
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.380]   who can help us get to the root of the trauma.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.020]   And there's so many times that's the answer
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.580]   to what's going on with people.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.900]   You know, people I've seen have had five residential stays,
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.780]   I'm not exaggerating this, for mental health reasons,
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.180]   for substance reasons, and no one's ever taken
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.540]   a trauma history, right?
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.100]   And then when you take a trauma history, you say,
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.980]   well, that's obviously where this is all coming from, right?
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.280]   Like that's when the drug use started truly thereafter,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.260]   the negative self-talk and the negative feelings
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.600]   that led to the drug use.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.260]   Then you go after the trauma and you can change things.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.820]   Whereas trying to change things
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.540]   without looking introspecting, talking about the trauma,
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.160]   I think of course was futile.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.460]   - Do you think that people who can start
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.940]   to have negative fantasies?
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.260]   I mean, you mentioned this woman who would take
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.820]   these long drives to berate herself.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.320]   I'm not familiar with that,
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.700]   but I'll give a little bit of personal disclosure here.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.140]   I've felt several times in my life
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.700]   that I will start to create a narrative
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.120]   about something that truly hasn't happened,
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.940]   about something terrible that somebody is going to do
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.920]   that's going to upset me.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.740]   And for the longest time, I would wonder,
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.700]   why am I doing this?
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.420]   And I have a couple ideas about why.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.940]   One is that I was attempting
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.400]   to just avoid thinking about other things.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.260]   It's just anger is such an attractive emotional force.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.900]   In a sense, it's an attractant.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.180]   It's not attractive, we don't like it.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.020]   And yet oftentimes anger is a great way
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.400]   to replace feeling something else, feeling sad
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.700]   or having to come up or to do work or to do something useful.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.700]   So it has this kind of like gravitational force to it.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.800]   That was one idea.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.560]   The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.120]   then actually that relationship
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.200]   could actually seem a lot better in reality.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.160]   It's almost like creating this negative contrast.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.220]   It's like, oh, well then it's not that bad.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.560]   And then the third possibility is I have no idea why,
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.000]   but it seemed like a reflex
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.400]   and I spent some time thinking about it.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.320]   I can't say I've resolved it completely,
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.120]   but why would somebody have a narrative
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.440]   or a default narrative when driving or when walking of,
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.680]   I'm just going to spend some time
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.080]   and think about how terrible this thing is going to turn out
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.860]   or how someone's going to upset me or harm me
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.780]   or how terrible I am.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.780]   It seems again like maladaptive thinking, maladaptive wiring
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.800]   and yet I have to assume that it serves some purpose.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.600]   I mean, I think there are three factors there
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.080]   and they're all bad.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.720]   And I think you spoke to at least two of them, right?
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.760]   They may, I think, speak so powerfully
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.480]   to how insidious trauma is
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.320]   and how these are real brain changes inside of us.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.600]   So I would say the three factors,
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.200]   punishment, avoidance and control, right?
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.100]   So the trauma inside of us that makes a guilt and shame
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:52.100]   so often, so often leads to a desire to punish oneself,
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.980]   right?
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.340]   And the idea that, oh, that was my fault or I deserve that.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.900]   Well, what do we do if something is someone's fault
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.200]   and someone now deserves punishment, right?
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.860]   I mean, we punish them, right?
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.900]   We send them to jail, we give them a fine, right?
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.760]   We punish them.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.740]   And so what we do is punish ourselves, right?
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.460]   And if we tell ourselves we're a loser
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.600]   or this awful thing is gonna happen, right?
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.580]   Then part of what we're doing is saying to ourselves,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.200]   see, right, you deserve that.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.700]   You're not gonna have anything better, right?
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:21.060]   It's a negative, it's a very negative way
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.340]   that the brain tries to make us, in a sense, do better
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.080]   by hurting us more for the things that we couldn't
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.380]   and shouldn't have been able to,
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.300]   weren't expected to control in the first place, right?
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.100]   The second is distraction.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.900]   As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:41.740]   can distract us from affect, feeling, and emotion
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.140]   that can be much more negative.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.500]   You know, anger, it can be more gratifying
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.740]   than certainly than guilt or shame,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.060]   although guilt and shame can serve a punishment purpose.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.220]   But if anger is directed also towards ourselves, right,
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.660]   then it can serve punishment too.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.300]   So punishment, avoidance, and the sense of control
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.540]   that if you think ahead to something awful
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.900]   that you're imagining is going to happen,
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.060]   well, maybe that will let you avoid it, right?
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.380]   I mean, you can see the brain here,
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.020]   in a sense, really confused.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.200]   I mean, part of the brain wants to punish,
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.300]   part of the brain doesn't want to think about it at all,
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.480]   and part of the brain wants to make it better.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.020]   And then how all of that resolves
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.480]   if we're not aware that, hey, this is in the context
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.520]   of our brains being deeply impacted by trauma,
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.620]   so what's going on here is all maladaptive, right?
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.060]   'Cause these negative fantasies of the future,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.380]   they may help us feel better
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.020]   about something in the present,
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.740]   but they don't help us make anything better, right?
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.860]   They don't help us make anything better.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.540]   So this is the kind of the sequelae.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.160]   This is where trauma and all this reflexive stuff
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.300]   that happens after trauma ultimately lead us.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.120]   And you can see how we get lost,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.780]   how I've seen over and over again in my own life,
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.820]   in the lives of other people,
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.180]   how, man, we get stuck in those situations.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.860]   That's why I see people sometimes,
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.060]   this has been going on for 30 years, 40 years, right?
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.220]   And it's just been going on over and over and over again
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.700]   because there's no natural end to any of this, right?
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.420]   Unless we look at it in a different way
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.340]   that we've knowledge and information like,
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.220]   whoa, this isn't the way it has to be.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.720]   Let me bring a novel perspective to this.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.180]   It doesn't change on its own.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.180]   - I'm struck by your statement
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.420]   that these thoughts or behaviors can make us feel better,
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.280]   but they don't actually make anything better.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   In that way, this mode of imagining terrible outcomes
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.500]   starts to immediately seem like taking opioids.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.820]   You feel better in the moment,
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.500]   but it doesn't actually make anything better
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.300]   and it probably makes things worse.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.140]   - Yes.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.260]   - And just a question of how much worse
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.560]   and in what direction.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.140]   - Yes.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.540]   - And so I just want to just pause on that concept
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.700]   because I think that concept of makes us feel better
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.920]   but doesn't make anything better.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.740]   I think it answers an earlier question
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:10.260]   about what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.400]   We need to confront the thing,
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.520]   but we don't want to go into the repetition compulsion.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.460]   So it's a knife edge there to navigate through trauma.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.300]   - Yes.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.200]   - Working with a very skilled clinician like yourself,
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.280]   I think is the ideal circumstance for people.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.020]   And of course, there are people who can't access support
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.160]   from somebody for whatever reason.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   You've talked about journaling as a useful tool.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.180]   Maybe you highlight some of the other things
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.580]   that people can do on their own.
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.940]   And then I'd also like to talk about
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.580]   what makes for a good therapist.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.580]   What should people look for
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.300]   for those that are seeking therapy,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.760]   especially nowadays when a lot of therapy
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.020]   is being done remotely.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.660]   But let's just start with the,
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.600]   let's just call them self-generated
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   or zero cost sorts of things.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.660]   Journaling being the first,
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.780]   and then what are some of the others?
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.780]   And what kind of structure would you recommend
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.700]   someone put around journaling?
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.940]   Carry a journal around all day
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.260]   and jot things down as they come up
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.540]   or sit down and spend an hour
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.280]   writing in complete sentences, for instance?
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.120]   - Yeah.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.140]   If I could add something to what you had just said
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.540]   before the question, right?
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.780]   That we have these short-term coping mechanisms in us, right?
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.420]   And in a way it makes sense, right?
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.500]   If we find ourselves in just terrible situations,
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.380]   then a short-term coping mechanism
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.040]   can get us through them, right?
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.680]   So our brains are built that way
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.980]   and that's part of survival too, right?
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.020]   And whether now in the modern world,
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.700]   whether it's food, it's drugs, it's sex, it's alcohol, right?
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.020]   Or it's negative thoughts, right?
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.800]   This is short-term soothing.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.600]   Even the negative thoughts and anger is short-term soothing
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.480]   at the expense of long-term change, right?
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:59.240]   And that's where addictive pathways can come into play
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.720]   and that's where again,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.800]   how we're built evolutionarily for survival
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.200]   doesn't help us in the way humans have evolved.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.480]   Like we haven't lived this way
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.880]   throughout 99.9 something percent of human history, right?
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.260]   So we're not adapted to this.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.800]   So I want to just make a point of saying that
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.160]   about the short-term soothing
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.680]   at the expense of long-term change, you know?
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.520]   And then the question you had asked about say journaling
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.980]   or what can we do that's outside of a professional,
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.060]   I think the hallmark of it
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.800]   has to be bringing new eyes to it, right?
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.680]   Like thinking about self with a curiosity
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.440]   instead of just a simple automaticity or repetition, right?
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.640]   Like why am I thinking about this?
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.180]   When did this start?
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.460]   Why is this in me?
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.520]   It's that whether it's words or whether we're writing
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.660]   that's so important.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.160]   So I think for journaling, it depends on the person.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.560]   I mean, we don't want somebody carrying around
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.980]   a journal all day if then there's a compulsion
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.080]   to I need to write about everything
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.260]   that's going on in my mind, right?
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.480]   Like that might be good to,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.340]   okay, write a little bit at night, right?
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.080]   Or someone who might think,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.720]   sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.920]   and it could be unpredictable, right?
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.860]   I want to have the journal with me.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.940]   So, ah, that thing is back in my mind now.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.520]   Let me write about it, right?
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.240]   Because then putting words to it
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.560]   and then being able to read those words, right?
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.000]   And when people read, even do a little bit of journaling
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.600]   and they read like, oh, I thought again
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.840]   about how I'm a terrible person who can't have a good life
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.000]   because I was in such a bad car accident
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.640]   or because that person attacked me
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.240]   or because when I was in school, I was bullied
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.760]   because I looked different than everyone else, right?
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.520]   Or I acted different for everyone else.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.880]   Wow, you know, to actually see that written out,
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.360]   it's, you know, it's a little bit of that,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.760]   it's a little bit of that,
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.280]   like when you're saying it to someone
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.900]   as if it were someone else, right?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.840]   Because now there's enough distance from it.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.860]   Like I'm looking at the words I wrote, right?
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.800]   That we get some distance and we can start to integrate
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.880]   some of the, not just the compassion,
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.460]   but integrating compassion and logic, right?
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.320]   Of like, okay, I feel a sense of compassion.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.560]   Oh wait, what does this mean?
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.560]   What really happened here, right?
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.440]   And gosh, I did start thinking differently after that.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.480]   I started, that's where this came from, right?
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.080]   That's why I'm saying this.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.960]   It's those kinds of revelations that we can have
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.600]   through, again, the written or spoken word.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.760]   And I think, again, that involves a trusted other
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.320]   or writing, right?
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.400]   And I think that those are ways we can do this
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.660]   where we bring some de novo perspective
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.200]   to something that often has been bouncing around
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.040]   inside of us.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.400]   And it's amazing to me that I can see such intelligent
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.560]   and pathically attuned people who've had the same thing
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.320]   running over and over again in their mind for years.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.220]   And it just points out that our brains
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.320]   don't automatically say, hey, wait a second.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.480]   I've been spinning wheels here for a long, long time.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.440]   Like, was there another way to look at this?
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.320]   We need something from the outside,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.080]   which can just be knowledge, right?
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.940]   Which is why I think what we're doing here
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.800]   or the reason I wrote the book that I wrote
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   was apprehending this amazing surprise to me, right?
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.600]   Which is like, wow, like some huge percentage
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.040]   of everything I'm treating is rooted in trauma
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.280]   and the opacity of trauma, right?
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   Which is why we don't see that, oh, the depression,
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.680]   the panic attacks, the life change, the addiction,
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.320]   the maladaptive choices, like, oh, this is all coming
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   from trauma because it hides itself in that opacity.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.520]   So we need a de novo perspective if we're doing it
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.480]   on our own and we need that if we're doing it in therapy,
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.920]   which might link to like finding the right therapist, right?
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.120]   Which is also part of your question.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:48.120]   - Yeah, I definitely want to know about how to assess
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.300]   and find the right therapist.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.300]   Before we cover that, however, something came up
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.100]   in the course of your answer.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.040]   I can immediately relate to this idea
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   that certain behaviors are really maladaptive
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.920]   and are stuffing things down or avoiding the topic
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.160]   is problematic and bringing a curiosity
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.800]   and an introspection and almost a third personing
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.840]   of the experience that we've had in order to try
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.160]   and address it truly from a new perspective.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.640]   It occurred to me as we were discussing this, however,
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.600]   that some people, and yes, maybe I'm talking a little bit
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.000]   about my own experience, we have a sense of our own identity
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.480]   and how people view us and our ability
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.160]   to be functional in the world in ways that we like.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.320]   Effective at work or a good brother or a good mother
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.320]   or father or human being in the world.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.680]   We have relationships.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.840]   And I think that one thing that I have heard
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.720]   and maybe I've experienced is that sometimes
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.680]   those maladaptive thoughts or behaviors,
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.400]   the things that generate a kind of a repetition of anger
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.340]   or of arousal or activation or sadness,
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.880]   that we have some internal process where we funnel that
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.720]   into a functionality in the world.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.480]   So I'll give a more concrete example.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.760]   So in thinking about things that have upset me in the past
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.900]   and in imagining bad outcomes in the future,
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.960]   there's a certain internal state of arousal
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.240]   that comes about.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.560]   And for many years, I was able to use that,
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.040]   not to feel angry, but rather to work an extra three hours
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.400]   a day or to pack my schedule
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.820]   with work and social engagement so I could show up
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.180]   in a way that I hopefully was a very good brother
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.780]   to my sister, for instance.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.940]   So in a way it was a transformation of something negative
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.900]   inside of me into a functionality in the world
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.960]   that was actually very rewarding and beneficial.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.100]   And yet in describing it, I can immediately see
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.120]   how it would be wonderful if I could source
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.540]   from something else.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:58.000]   And yet you can imagine and I can imagine
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.040]   how one would be reluctant, maybe even terrified
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.020]   of giving up that source, it's a fuel.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:08.560]   And I think in knowing some of the traumas of other people
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.040]   and their reluctance to work through those,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.480]   obviously I'm not a therapist,
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.980]   I sense this over and over again
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.780]   that one's positive identity can often be linked
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:20.840]   to something difficult in their past.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.960]   And so people are reluctant to give up this fuel
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.000]   because in that sense, it's functional.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.480]   The only thing that allowed me to kind of start
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.180]   to address this and why I'm still so curious about this,
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.520]   'cause I don't think I've worked through this process
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.600]   completely, again, a little more self-disclosure there,
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   is that I was told that these words,
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.160]   just imagine how much better it would be
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.980]   if you could source from a different fuel,
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.360]   a fuel that felt better.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.180]   Maybe, it was on this sentence,
[00:59:55.180 --> 01:00:00.180]   it was maybe you could actually be much more effective.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.360]   Maybe you could be 10 times the better brother.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.460]   Maybe you could have 10 times more
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.320]   insider work capacity, et cetera.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.820]   So it's on that hint of a promise
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.900]   that at least I was inspired to start looking
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.520]   into these things and reading about trauma in your book
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.240]   and elsewhere and start to think about this.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.300]   So again, I realize this is a long-winded question
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.320]   and a somewhat complex idea, but I think,
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.120]   or I hope that people will be able to resonate
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.280]   with this idea that sometimes we want to stay attached
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.160]   to this short-term soothing,
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.920]   that the punishment, distraction, or control,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.960]   because it evokes this arousal
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.880]   and then we can apply that arousal.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.280]   - Yes, yes.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.040]   I think what you're describing maps, I think, clinically
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.800]   to what gets called sublimation.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.640]   So there's something negative inside of us,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.560]   but we sort of transfer that energy,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.500]   we transfer that into something that is adaptive
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.800]   or that is positive, right?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.120]   So the idea of anger, right?
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.400]   When I think of that thing and it makes anger in me,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.480]   I channel that into harder work, right?
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.640]   Or I channel that into like,
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.000]   I'm gonna go be nicer to my brother, something like that.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.720]   And there's validity to that, right?
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.680]   And, but it can become like self-justifying.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.320]   If a person thinks, well, like,
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.080]   look at what this is doing for me, right?
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.160]   I wouldn't work as hard without it, right?
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.360]   Now we start to become attached to the trauma,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.120]   whereas I think what you had said is absolutely true,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.280]   that just because we can sublimate
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.160]   some of the negative affect feeling emotion
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.960]   that comes from trauma into something productive,
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.840]   doesn't mean that that's best, right?
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.000]   I mean, you know, we can get to our destination
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.160]   by taking a very circuitous route, right?
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.720]   We might waste an hour getting there, but we get there.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.280]   That doesn't mean that that's best.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.400]   And it also doesn't look at all the negative, right?
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.220]   In this example, the wasted fuel, the wasted time, right?
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.840]   We get somewhere, but we are not optimizing.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   And I have yet to see one person who has addressed the trauma
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.140]   and become less functional, right?
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.080]   It's always either they're just as functional,
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.720]   but they're happier, right?
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.080]   Or more functional, because as you said,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.880]   like just because we may be able to sublimate,
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.960]   well, maybe what's going on will be 10 times better, right?
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.180]   If we weren't sublimating,
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.000]   because the sublimation limits us, right?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.480]   It limits our perspective to only what we can see and do
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.360]   through the lens of the trauma.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.500]   And that is never better than the alternative.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.180]   - Thank you for that.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.400]   - Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.120]   - Let's discuss how one could or should go
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.720]   about finding a really good therapist.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:39.120]   Typically, in my experience, this is done by word of mouth.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.960]   You know, there's this person,
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.800]   you might want to work with them, they're really great.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.200]   But what are some of the characteristics
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.800]   that one should look for?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.400]   And should we take into account whether or not
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.800]   we are a person who, you know, for instance,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.040]   I've heard this from listeners,
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.080]   although I'm definitely not talking about myself here
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.520]   in cloaking something.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.740]   Some people will say, you know,
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.520]   I want to work with a somatic therapist
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.560]   because I've actually heard someone say,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.680]   I think in feels, you know, I feel stuff in my body,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.760]   so I want to work with someone
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.220]   who can really acknowledge that.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.960]   Or someone else will say, you know,
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.720]   I want to work with somebody who has this orientation
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.400]   or that orientation, or is open to my particular lifestyle,
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.440]   or isn't going to tell me
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.080]   that I have to leave my relationship.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.920]   You know, I feel like people already show up
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.760]   to the question of who to work with,
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.960]   with all these, you know, things internally,
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.520]   some of which are voiced and some of which aren't.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.000]   So I'd love for you to talk about maybe
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.160]   some of the core features of a really good therapist,
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.480]   and then how to look for a therapist,
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.320]   and also how to think about oneself
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.620]   in looking for a therapist
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.760]   because of these kind of predispositions.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.960]   - Right, right.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.300]   Well, there's a lot of data about this over the years
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:53.120]   that if you look at what are the top 10 important factors
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   to find in a therapist, just repeat rapport 10 times, right?
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.520]   I mean, that's the key.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.100]   And if you think about that, it's pretty amazing, right?
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.480]   Because therapeutic modalities can be so different, right?
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.000]   And I think what that's telling us is,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.560]   in a way, something very obvious, right?
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.880]   Like, what does rapport mean?
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.840]   Like, you know, somebody's paying attention, right?
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.680]   It's trust, it's a back and forth.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.900]   It's like, yeah, even I'm doing something difficult,
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.520]   I'm doing it with someone who's really helping me,
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.040]   someone who's in it with me, right?
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.480]   Someone who's really paying attention,
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.520]   wants me to be better, that's indispensable.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.960]   I mean, it's just indispensable.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.900]   And I write in the book,
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.120]   is someone, a therapist is not making eye contact,
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.620]   or this is the way they do it, right?
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.320]   And you know, you gotta fit into the box
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.540]   of the way they do it.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.780]   That is not going to be helpful.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.660]   And then what I think about that is,
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.880]   the different modalities,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.500]   it doesn't actually tell us that,
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.980]   oh, the modality is irrelevant.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.800]   I think that's not true.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.480]   I think that good therapists are not pigeonholed
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.800]   by a certain modality.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.920]   They may come at the world largely through a psychodynamic,
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.060]   or a CBT, or a DBT lens.
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.360]   There's lots of different ways to do therapy.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.160]   But when you really talk to those people,
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.400]   really good, experienced therapists,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.560]   it's all coming through the vehicle of the rapport,
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.220]   but they're practically shifting to what the person needs.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.420]   You know, I don't understand the idea that like,
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.580]   oh, I just do this, right?
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.420]   I don't do that.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.340]   And when people are pigeonholed that way,
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.980]   I don't think they help their patients very well, right?
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.280]   We have to be diverse enough to say,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.700]   hey, I want all the arrows in the quiver, right?
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.940]   And even though there might be one that I favor,
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.000]   and that's the lens I see things through,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.140]   no, I can be versatile, I can shift,
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.660]   I can adapt to what this person needs.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.840]   And I think if you have that, you've got a,
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.240]   if you have that, you've got a winning combination.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.820]   - Great, so people should perhaps try a few therapists
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.880]   and maybe have a session or two or three
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   to see if the rapport feels like it's taking root.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.240]   Is that, do you have that right?
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.200]   - Yeah, and I think that's why word of mouth is important,
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.720]   right, if someone you trust tells you,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.480]   hey, this is a good person, that says a lot, right?
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.160]   It already makes the pretest probability is quite high.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:06.080]   But yes, it's interesting to see when people have a therapist
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.260]   or they called their insurance
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.340]   and they're assigned a therapist, this thought that like,
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.260]   oh, that's the person I have to have now.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.980]   And it's like, no, you should look at that like anyone,
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.380]   you would be interviewing, right, for a job, right?
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.940]   But you gotta bring, again, the right set of thoughts
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.980]   to that to be helped, right?
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.520]   Which is like, I want someone who has rapport with me.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.940]   I don't want someone who's gonna make it easy, right?
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.700]   Who's like, well, it's, gosh, it's kind of pleasant
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.100]   because then that means they're not talking
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.520]   about the difficult things, right?
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.900]   So if one brings like, I know this isn't gonna be easy,
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.920]   I gotta talk about difficult things, right?
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.440]   Even if one doesn't recognize,
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.420]   oh, I gotta talk about the trauma in me, right?
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.320]   But to go to therapy thinking, no, it's,
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.740]   I mean, sometimes it's enjoyable,
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.860]   but a lot of times, right, it's not, right?
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.940]   It's hard work, it can be excruciating, we can cry doing it.
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.180]   But to say, right, that that's how I'm gonna be helped
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.180]   and I want someone who's gonna do that with me,
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.900]   you know, who's really looking at
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.360]   what's going on inside of me, how do we help me?
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.440]   And I can feel sort of the robustness of that.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.580]   If one brings that approach and then looks at the therapist
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.880]   through that lens, you're very likely to then move on
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.060]   from someone who's not a good choice, right?
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.940]   And really stick with someone who is,
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.400]   even though that doesn't mean
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.560]   it's always like pleasant and enjoyable.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.600]   I mean, it has to not be that sometimes.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.060]   - Right.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.340]   Maybe we could drill a little deeper
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.540]   into the mechanics of therapy.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.120]   I put out a few questions to audience
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.720]   asking what they want to know about therapy
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.100]   and it was amazing.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.600]   I got hundreds, if not thousands of responses saying,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.060]   how should I show up to therapy?
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.500]   So for instance, should people take
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.260]   a five minute meditative drop-in before
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.460]   or should they just show up cold and let it emerge?
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:46.700]   During therapy, is it a good idea to take notes
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.180]   or to not take notes?
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:52.540]   And then post-therapy, how should clients, patients,
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.880]   as they're sometimes called one or the other,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.320]   I never know which, how should they process that information?
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.840]   Should they take some designated time afterwards
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.380]   and in an ideal world, take a 30 minute walk afterwards
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.820]   and think about the material
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.620]   or should they set it aside and come back to it?
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.120]   Of course there are constraints, work and family, et cetera.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.980]   But there's a lot of knowledge out there
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.340]   about how to best show up to a workout,
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.700]   warm up for five, 10 minutes, then do this, et cetera.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.620]   And then the cool down.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.880]   I mean, here we're talking about hard psychological work
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.340]   aimed at bettering oneself.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.040]   So to my knowledge, I've not ever seen this information
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.840]   anywhere, it'd be very useful to hear your thoughts on this.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.300]   - Yeah, well, I'm not trying to duck the question,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.800]   but I think it varies so much by person.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.520]   So if you think about the first part of your question,
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.020]   I think was how to show up to therapy, right?
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.180]   And I think the answer would be,
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.820]   whatever lets you be fully present when you're in therapy.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:50.020]   Now, for some people, there's gonna be, I show up early,
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.520]   I sit, I calm myself, I meditate a little bit.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.440]   I mean, that's how then they're present, right?
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.440]   For other people, they just show up, walk into the room,
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.280]   they can stop another present, right?
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.480]   'Cause whatever works for that person
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.660]   so that they're really there, their thoughts,
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.320]   their energy is really in what's going on.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.540]   And the same thing applies on the other end.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.040]   Now, there are people who are really well-served
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.000]   by going for a walk if they can
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.660]   or sitting quietly after therapy,
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.200]   kind of putting that in order, right?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.840]   Otherwise they lose some of it, right?
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.040]   Or like some of the ahas, right?
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.920]   Or the, oh, that's an interesting thought
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.300]   that they really need to put it in order.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.520]   Maybe that involves taking some notes during therapy, right?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.880]   For other people, they need to do the exact opposite.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.900]   They need to like leave, not think about that at all,
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.560]   and then they can reflect on it later and learn from it.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.360]   So, you know, we're so different.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.820]   Human beings, there's such a diversity in us
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:43.160]   that I think there's no hard answer to that.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.040]   It was like being present when it's happening,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.780]   then being able to sort of consolidate
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:53.160]   and retain what's been gained is most important.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.880]   And I think we have to figure that out person by person.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.580]   I mean, I try and do that in the work of like,
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.500]   what's serving this person best?
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.580]   And sometimes we, you know, sometimes it evolves
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.220]   and sometimes we talk about it, but it varies so much.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.960]   - If someone were thinking about embarking on therapy
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.120]   or more therapy to address trauma
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.460]   or just general issues of life,
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.380]   what is the frequency that you recommend?
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.340]   I could imagine two extreme models.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.420]   One is, okay, I'm going to finally tackle this trauma.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.140]   I'm going to do therapy three times a week,
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.260]   but for a shorter period of time, you know,
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.900]   six months, you know, over and out,
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.440]   versus this open-ended model of once a week,
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.400]   typically for as long as it takes.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.820]   - Right, right.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.580]   I think that also varies.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.820]   And I work with people in varied ways
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.000]   from someone who's doing well,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.700]   and like we meet for a half hour every six months, right,
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.800]   to doing week-long hourly sessions,
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.140]   to spending three intense days with someone in a row, right?
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   So I think as far as like kind of guiding principles,
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.100]   what I have found in my own life,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.760]   'cause I value my own therapy tremendously,
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.900]   so I found in my own life and in my own clinical work,
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.400]   that if it's less than once a week,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.560]   then it's hard for us to retain, really.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.620]   You know, we spend a lot of time kind of catching up,
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.460]   okay, what's happened?
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.960]   Let's get back to the place we were at before, right?
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.260]   Which is why I think if we're really going to get somewhere,
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.400]   we're not just trying to maintain something, right?
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.560]   Then I think once a week for an hour
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.280]   is really kind of the minimum, right?
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.440]   But more intensive work, it's like the more intense it is,
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.200]   it's not linear, right?
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.480]   It's an exponential gain.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.520]   Like we do a lot of intensive work, right?
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.040]   Where someone will come and do 30 clinical hours with us
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.500]   over the course of a week.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.040]   So five or six different clinicians, 30 clinical hours.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   And we've found that the benefits of doing that are immense.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.380]   It's like I say, a year's worth of therapy consolidated.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.640]   And you take both 30 hours,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.920]   let's say we go almost every week,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.980]   maybe that's 45 or 50 hours,
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.560]   but 30 hours with that kind of intensity
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.840]   is worth probably 60 hours done in a different way.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.080]   Because then it's in us in an active way, right?
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.840]   It's in the therapist in an active way.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   It becomes very, very dynamic.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.960]   So I think turning up the intensity,
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.720]   if there's something that we really need to process,
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.840]   absolutely makes sense.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.760]   And I do that in my own life is something now it's like,
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.480]   whoa, something is really distressing me.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.640]   And it's linking into prior trauma.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.260]   And I can see what's going on in me.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:36.160]   Now I start to have ruminative thoughts with negativity.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.200]   Like I got to go more, right?
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.240]   Because I got to do that processing
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.040]   so I can get to the place that I am,
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.880]   which is not that,
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.320]   it's not that the trauma has no impact on me, right?
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.200]   It's that the impact is much less
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.940]   than it was before the therapy.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.840]   And that I most often, more often than not,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.680]   have an ability to see
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.440]   when it's now intruding into my thoughts.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.040]   And it's taking me away
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.640]   from like what I really think and believe,
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.000]   or being able to draw logic and emotion together
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.400]   and make good decisions.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.320]   Turning up the intensity then absolutely makes sense.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.280]   - This very deep, intensive work of 30 hours in a week,
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.160]   what brings somebody to the type of work of that sort?
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.300]   Is it a suicide risk or a severe addiction situation?
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.280]   I mean, how does one gauge how much therapy
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.320]   they ought to be doing?
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.320]   And should it always be on the therapist
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.200]   to decide that frequency?
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.440]   What would bring someone to a situation
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.080]   of five therapists in 30 hours a week in one week?
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.600]   - Right, right.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.840]   Yeah, it's usually a person
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.800]   who is really distressed by something,
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.320]   whether that's, it's so negatively impacting their life.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.360]   Or sometimes a person comes to a realization,
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.680]   I just can't take this anymore, right?
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.480]   Or I'm sick of this cyclical depression
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.960]   and I got to stop having panic attacks.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.880]   Like I need help, right?
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.680]   But it's usually some crisis point
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.640]   with the idea of crisis and the meaning of,
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.060]   okay, something comes to a head
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.120]   and after it things are gonna be different, right?
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.760]   Not a crisis and things are gonna be negative afterwards,
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.240]   but a point where then that cognitive flexibility
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.300]   comes to the fore of like,
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.360]   wait, I need to do something different, right?
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.480]   So that's often what brings us.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.120]   You know, sometimes it's other people pointing it out
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.480]   or somebody's had an intervention somewhere,
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.800]   or yes, that person has been hospitalized
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.120]   after a suicide attempt,
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.780]   or they've gone back to rehab again for the third
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.080]   or fourth time and their life is really in danger.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.280]   Sometimes it's that, and sometimes it's a person realizing,
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.200]   yeah, I just wanna, I wanna look at myself,
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.040]   I wanna understand myself better.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.060]   You know, I know that what's going on in me
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.100]   isn't as good as it can be, right?
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.940]   So I think people can come to it
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.560]   for all sorts of different ways.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.320]   And I think, yes, I think a lot of times
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.960]   it would be the therapist to say it looks more work,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.320]   you know, more intensive work or can make a difference.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.000]   But I think the person also needs to, you know,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.980]   take ownership, right, of their own therapy
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.960]   and say, if I don't feel hoped enough,
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.540]   well, I have to think about that, right?
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.240]   And talk to the therapist about that
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.960]   'cause maybe that therapist isn't a match, right?
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.480]   Or maybe you talk to the therapist
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.640]   and the therapist can change his or her approach, right?
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.320]   Or maybe you talk to the therapist
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.280]   and increase the frequency, right?
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.380]   But the idea is to be aware of it, right?
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.760]   And if one's needs aren't being met, to acknowledge that,
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.480]   right, 'cause people can get into a rhythm of therapy
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.840]   where it's really not helping them, right?
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.240]   But they either feel sort of nihilistic about it,
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.640]   like, oh, I'm no better and I'm going to therapy, right?
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.760]   Or sometimes there's a sense that while I'm in therapy,
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.160]   so I'm kind of checking that box
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.560]   of doing something for myself,
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.400]   but it's not really getting me anywhere.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.200]   And then the part of the brain that's controlled
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.240]   by the guilt and shame and avoidance
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.080]   thinks that's a great idea, right?
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.320]   So again, this ability to observe ourselves
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.520]   and like, what's going on?
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.680]   Am I being helped in the way, do I feel helped, right?
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.560]   Am I in some ways even like happy that I'm not feeling helped
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.720]   'cause I don't have to face this thing
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.160]   I don't want to face, right?
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.840]   Or am I too afraid to say I need more help, right?
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.760]   Do we really need to look at ourselves?
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.440]   And this is where the insurance systems
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.560]   often are very difficult
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.520]   'cause it's hard sometimes for a person to say,
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.780]   oh, I need more therapy 'cause that may not be possible,
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.620]   right?
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.640]   So there are sort of negative factors
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.700]   in the world around us,
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.560]   but ultimately I think the answer to the question
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.120]   comes down to observing ourselves
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.560]   and taking ownership of like what's going on in us
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.800]   and how we're feeling
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.120]   and then feeling that commitment to self
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.740]   or to self-care to say, I need to go change this.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.960]   - And for those that maybe don't have the means
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.880]   or insurance or access to do even one day a week therapy
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.360]   in the journaling model,
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.240]   could one perhaps take an entire day,
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.520]   as awful as it might seem,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.240]   to do a lot of journaling and thinking and walking,
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.400]   you know, do a self-generated intensive,
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.240]   do you think there's utility to that?
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.760]   - I mean, there could be, but again, it depends by person
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.120]   'cause there could also be something negative about that.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.920]   If it's, you know, someone who's not at the point,
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.940]   not ready for that, right?
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.920]   I mean, we don't come at,
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.500]   you know, we don't come directly at the trauma immediately,
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.300]   at least most of the time we don't do that, right?
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.600]   And we often don't explore it in depth.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.840]   Like this idea that, oh, that person now has to go through
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.360]   every second of the trauma is actually not true.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.040]   I mean, sometimes it is,
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.440]   but that's not the common situation, right?
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.840]   It's more often that person has to acknowledge,
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.480]   like the example of like, I was sexually abused.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.160]   And if they acknowledge that and say, okay, like, gosh,
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.440]   what has that done to me?
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.640]   That doesn't mean, well, let's parse out every moment
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   of like how that was and the terror of that, right?
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.220]   So that can lead people to a worse place, right?
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:49.220]   So I think the idea of biting off small pieces, so to speak,
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.100]   where a person is writing, right, or is talking.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.440]   But I think if one is writing,
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.360]   it is good to communicate with another, right?
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.220]   Another trusted person.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.780]   And if there's not someone in one's personal life,
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.720]   you know, they're clergy members.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.020]   Even if one isn't affiliated with an organized religion,
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.240]   you could probably go places and get a clergy
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.680]   to want to help you, right?
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.760]   I mean, there are people out there
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.040]   who want to help other people.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.380]   So we say, what if someone has no one?
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.180]   I mean, almost never do we have no one here, right?
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.900]   'Cause we could probably go find someone.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.040]   But we need to take that in pieces.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.480]   So there's some risk to trying to do the intensive thing,
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.120]   you know, on one's own.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.600]   And that's where I would put in,
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.040]   if a person's having suicidal thoughts
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.680]   or even thoughts of death, of not wanting to be alive,
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.840]   I don't deserve to be alive.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.460]   I mean, these are warning signs for really getting help.
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.760]   So there are some signs that say,
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.840]   hey, don't try and do that on your own, right?
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.440]   Go try and find a resource.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.320]   And it's, you know, things that get to that level
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.520]   of severity of, and often a person knows that.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.380]   I mean, am I in a place where I know I'm not healthy
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.040]   and I'm having kind of scary thoughts?
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.960]   Then we need, that's a person
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.120]   who really shouldn't be doing that on their own.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.240]   - Great, thank you for that.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.400]   - Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.140]   - So we've been talking a lot about talking.
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.720]   And now I'd like to talk a little bit about chemistry.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.560]   - Yes.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.380]   - Drugs.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.260]   - Yes.
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.240]   - So maybe first we could talk prescription drugs.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.840]   I mean, you're a psychiatrist, so you're approved to
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.320]   and presumably do prescribed medication
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.360]   where appropriate.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   And this is a vast landscape, of course.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.720]   We've got ADHD.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.320]   And I should just tell you, I get more questions
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.840]   about ADHD and the drugs related to ADHD and dopamine
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.320]   than any other topic, any other topic.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.520]   So there's ADHD, there's OCD, there's depression,
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.480]   there's antidepressants and so forth.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.720]   Is there some way that we can wrap our arms around
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.720]   all of that as a way of wading into this drug question
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.680]   and just address, how does one decide
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.280]   when medication is useful?
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.920]   Because in the end, the dissection tool
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.840]   that the psychiatrist or therapist has is language.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.840]   And at some point, one has to make an assessment
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.760]   about dopamine or serotonin
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   or whether or not a given drug would help.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   And most therapies, I believe don't involve
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.240]   putting someone in a brain scanner.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.840]   And to my knowledge, there still is not
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.680]   a very good blood test to assess,
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:14.680]   oh, is this person's dopamine low or high?
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.960]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.760]   And ultimately that, and I know there are companies
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.680]   out there, so I'm not trying to undermine those companies.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.120]   But if I happen to do that in this statement,
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.840]   if you take a blood test and find that your serotonin
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.160]   metabolites are low, my understanding is it's possible
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.600]   that you are too low in serotonin in the brain,
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.160]   but that's a very indirect window
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.680]   into what's really going on.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   So how do you think about prescription drugs
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.560]   in the context of treating trauma and other conditions?
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.800]   And then maybe we'll drill into some
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.520]   of the more specific conditions.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.640]   - Sure, I mean, I would first comment that, right,
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.880]   there aren't tests for these things.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.640]   And I think the tests for metabolites,
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.520]   I mean, things are so different, you know,
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.000]   by the time what we're talking about has been metabolized,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.160]   you know, often to some very significant extent,
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.280]   left the brain, now it's in the peripheral blood
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.400]   that we really don't learn from that.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.960]   And I think that we tend to overutilize medicines
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.320]   in this country because we have a healthcare system
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.520]   that often, that's so based on throughput
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.880]   that we wanna polish the hood
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.360]   when there's a problem in the engine, right?
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.040]   So we overutilize medicines often as an endpoint, right?
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.720]   Oh, we're gonna make that person's depression better
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.440]   with an antidepressant.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.240]   Well, I mean, maybe, right?
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.800]   But most of the time, for that person's depression
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.400]   to really get better and stay better,
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.800]   they need to unravel what's driving the depression, right?
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.120]   So the first step is,
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.840]   I think there are two steps to it, right?
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.000]   The first assessment step is,
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   is there a diagnosis that the vast majority of the time,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   if not sometimes all the time, really warrants a medicine?
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.080]   So the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right?
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.080]   These are diagnoses that we understand more about them
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.600]   and what's going on in the brain
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.880]   and how medicines can treat or stabilize them,
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.680]   which doesn't mean the medicine is necessarily,
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.000]   it's not a substitute for therapy, right?
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.240]   But sometimes the medicine and therapy can go hand in hand.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.160]   So for OCD, for example, warrants therapy,
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.360]   but it almost, not always,
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.920]   but it almost always warrants medicine too
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.760]   so that you can ease the systems
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.880]   that are making the rigidity and the repetition in the brain.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.000]   So the first kind of branch point can be,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.120]   what is the diagnosis?
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   What is the level of severity, right?
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.960]   And I think that's very, very important.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.120]   Where I think it's a little more, maybe even interesting,
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.120]   is using medicines to help the person engage in the therapy
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.520]   as productively as possible.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   And here's where I think we're so limited
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.400]   by how we categorize medicines
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.280]   and this sort of pharmaceutical, insurance-driven,
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.600]   medical system we have that I think throws us off
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.840]   in tremendous ways.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.000]   So you think about how medicines are categorized,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.760]   so antidepressants.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.440]   And the vast majority of people
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.240]   who are helped by antidepressants,
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.480]   they don't have clinically severe depression, right?
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.600]   Those medicines create more distress tolerance in us, right?
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.960]   And if you think about how helpful that can be,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.800]   if you're gonna go,
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.960]   now you're gonna do something difficult,
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.760]   where you're gonna bring that trauma
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.160]   or the stressors to the surface and you're gonna process
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.120]   and you're gonna try and make life change.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.080]   If we can make more distress tolerance in us,
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.720]   that can be so, so much better, right?
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.520]   And think about the category of medicines
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.960]   that are called antipsychotics,
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.600]   which really puts people off, right?
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.680]   But most of the prescriptions for antipsychotics
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.600]   are not for psychosis, right?
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.520]   And there are ways in which low dosing
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.680]   of some of those medicines can help intervene
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.920]   in negative pathways, right?
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.200]   In pathways that are about distress
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.160]   and sending out those tendrils of neurons
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.480]   that are about hypervigilance and avoidance in our brain.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.520]   And we can often get at that.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.800]   And if you can improve someone's distress tolerance
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.400]   and you can use medicines that take away
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.480]   what clinically is rumination, right?
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.360]   Not the standard meaning of that word,
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.880]   but the clinical meaning of it,
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.240]   where there are distress centers in our brain
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.040]   that are overactive.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.240]   And then we get stuck
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.320]   in these maladaptive negative pathways,
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.280]   where we think about something over and over and over again
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.240]   with no real chance of solving it,
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.640]   because that's not what's going on inside of us.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.080]   So medicines can help that,
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.760]   but we have to have some flexibility
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.200]   around their conception.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.320]   And the modern medical system of a 15 minute visits,
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.400]   you know, to a psychiatrist that are weeks apart,
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.160]   I mean, I don't understand how that goes well, right?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.280]   In the vast majority of times,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.440]   I think it doesn't go well
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.200]   because it's not enough time to do the therapy,
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.040]   even generate the understanding.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.240]   So then medicines get thrown at the person.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.040]   This is how, you know, we use,
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.800]   I think approximately five times as much medicine,
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.200]   I think across the board as say the Dutch population, right?
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.080]   They think, well, why is five times more
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.600]   is a lot more medicine, right?
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.760]   And you know, they have a healthcare system
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.960]   and a cultural system that to the best of my understanding
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.560]   is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself, right?
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:19.600]   So if a person comes in and cholesterol is high, right?
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.560]   The first order of business is,
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.200]   hey, you can take better care of yourself, right?
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.120]   Like this person really needs to lose some weight,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.480]   exercise more, right?
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.080]   They're not just jumping to like,
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   let me give you a medicine
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.040]   and, you know, and shift you through the healthcare system
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.920]   and out the other side of the door, right?
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.280]   And the same thing is true in mental health, you know,
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.400]   and I'm not trying to be critical
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   to the psychiatrist or the nurse practitioners
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.600]   or people who are practicing in that way,
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.080]   because oftentimes there is no choice, right?
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.280]   If they're working in a healthcare system
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.760]   that the standard is highly spaced
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.480]   or spaced apart 15 minute visits,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.320]   what alternative is there, right?
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.560]   But to look at, okay, I'm gonna use medicines
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.600]   because I don't have another tool to bring to bear.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.200]   So I think the healthcare system
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.720]   and its focus on throughput and its short-term,
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:08.560]   talk about, you know,
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.600]   we talk about short-term response, right?
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.760]   There are short-term soothing
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.800]   at the expense of long-term health.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.480]   And I think that is the metaphor
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.800]   that applies to our healthcare system, right?
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.520]   Where if we are gonna try
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.480]   and treat a symptom in a short-term,
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.080]   we're gonna do it in a 15 minute visit,
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.800]   that we're gonna do it in a way
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.120]   that maybe it soothes the symptom, maybe it doesn't,
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.920]   but it does not get at the problem.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.080]   We need to invest more resources to get at the problem.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.760]   And I think that's where a sort of protest, you know,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.600]   if people, as a society,
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.640]   we say, look, we don't like the way our healthcare is going,
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.840]   like we need more focus on what the actual problems are,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.080]   that yes, we would spend more money,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.480]   you know, treating people and taking care of people
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.160]   'cause it's more human time,
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.280]   but ultimately less suffering, less death, right?
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.920]   And ultimately more productivity.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.520]   I think as an economy, we would save so much money
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.380]   if we spend money on the human aspects of mental healthcare
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.000]   because people would be more functional.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.960]   They're spending less time in the hospital, right?
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   They're more productive when they're working.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.080]   There's less entry into the criminal justice system.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.000]   So I think medicines get overused
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.200]   in part for systemic reasons,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.440]   in large part for systemic reasons,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.200]   and also for some of these categorization reasons.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.640]   Oh, that person meets some technical criteria
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.340]   for depression, we've got to give them this medicine
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.600]   instead of really thinking, wait,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.640]   what's going on in this person?
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.000]   And I see this over and over again.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.040]   I see someone who's on seven medicines
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.200]   and they're on seven medicines
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.120]   to treat seven different symptoms.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.280]   And now they have side effects
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.380]   from all those seven medicines.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.180]   Maybe two of them are to treat the side effects
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.900]   from the other five, right?
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.480]   And that's bad, right?
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.160]   And if you really get at what's going on in them,
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.720]   now they're doing much better
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.100]   and maybe they're on two medicines, right?
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.280]   So I don't know if that's a helpful answer to that.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.080]   - It is, it's a very helpful answer.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.600]   I mean, I think at least in the spheres
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.040]   that I run these days,
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.520]   I hear a lot of negative statements about antidepressants.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.720]   I think, you know, I'm old enough to remember
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.360]   the book "Listening to Prozac"
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.940]   and I remember when Prozac and things like it
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.840]   first started showing up and the excitement.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.980]   And then nowadays I hear more about the problems
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.380]   with all these drugs, you know?
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.220]   And maybe that's just 'cause I have arms
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.500]   in both the scientific,
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.040]   but also in the kind of wellness community
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.140]   where people think a lot about behavioral change.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.580]   Fortunately, I think that they do that.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:33.080]   But of course these drugs, as you mentioned,
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.460]   can have enormous utility as well.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.140]   I'd like to just pick up on one theme
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.140]   that I haven't heard a lot about anywhere else,
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:42.200]   which is the short-term versus the long-term use
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.040]   of these drugs.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.040]   'Cause I could imagine, you know,
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.760]   someone feeling like they're finally gonna tackle something
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.900]   that's been inside them for a long time,
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.720]   either because they're really struggling
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.540]   or because they're just done with not working it through.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:29:00.540]   And they decide to start a medication
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:04.100]   that would give them higher levels of distress tolerance
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.700]   for a short while.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:06.740]   I mean, is there anything to say
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:11.740]   that someone couldn't take a properly prescribed medication
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:15.940]   for a week or for the first three months of the work
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:17.500]   and then know that they can come off it?
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.980]   Because I think that the black and white model
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.340]   of, okay, you're either gonna start this drug
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:25.140]   and stay on it forever, or be taking some drugs forever,
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.040]   or you're not gonna take anything.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.940]   I mean, that just seems to,
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.100]   life doesn't, does life have to work that way?
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.700]   Is there short-term use that can be effective?
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.100]   - Yeah, absolutely, yes.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.860]   Yes, in American medicine,
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.420]   we are so much better at starting medicines
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.760]   than we are at taking them away, right?
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.800]   And part of that, I think, is driven
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.780]   by such a strong presence of the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.440]   And the pharmaceutical industry
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.860]   does a lot of very good things, right?
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.220]   But, you know, there's such thing
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.300]   as too much of a good thing, right?
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.460]   And then as a society, when something seems positive,
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.020]   this, I think, also is human nature.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.840]   We can over-invest in it, right?
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.240]   So you think about when Prozac
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.560]   and those kinds of medicines came out,
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.160]   they were safer medicines,
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.780]   they're billed as antidepressants,
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.780]   and the thought was, well, they're gonna fix depression,
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.980]   right, and it's not how that works, right?
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.220]   So if we look at them as tools, right,
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:22.500]   then we can deploy them sometimes for the longer term,
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.280]   'cause sometimes that's necessary,
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.040]   but absolutely for the shorter term, I mean, absolutely.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.100]   If we thought of Prozac and those kind of medicines,
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.100]   not as, oh, they're antidepressants,
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.540]   we thought, look, what they do
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:38.740]   is they seem to make there be more serotonin
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:42.980]   in certain circuits that are important for mood regulation,
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.700]   anxiety regulation, distress tolerance,
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.960]   so those medicines can really help somebody
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.540]   if they're very severely depressed
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:51.940]   and we wanna sort of get them feeling better.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.380]   They can also help someone
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:56.120]   if they could use more distress tolerance
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.560]   in a discrete period of time, right?
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.460]   When we think about them that way,
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.660]   we think about them as tools that we could apply
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.020]   for short-term or long-term.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.560]   We don't see them as fixes, right,
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.500]   and we don't see them as then substitutes
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.380]   for the human-to-human work that needs to be done.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.240]   I mean, I've been in my training at times
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.900]   in healthcare systems,
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:20.060]   and I've seen in many other circumstances
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.060]   that look at medicines as answers,
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.260]   and this idea that, oh, that person is a,
[01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:27.940]   and a lot of times there'll be a number, right?
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.860]   The number is the diagnosis,
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.380]   and that number gets this medicine,
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:36.140]   and I'm not sure we could be more misguided than that,
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.700]   and that's what leads to adding medicines,
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.020]   adding medicines, it's not working,
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.580]   of course it's not working,
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.540]   because no one's really paying attention to what's going on,
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.020]   so add more medicines and then medicines for the medicines,
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.860]   and I mean, we know this is true.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.900]   We know this is true,
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:52.020]   but we haven't had the wherewithal as a society
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.340]   to say, like with a lot of things in society,
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:56.340]   to say, hey, this isn't okay, right?
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.660]   I mean, we need more.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.380]   Give these people who are trying to help us,
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.940]   they need more latitude to help us,
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.500]   so we need more human-to-human contact
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.380]   to get at what's really going on,
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.380]   and yes, that's an investment of time and energy
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.100]   and money in the short term,
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.540]   and sometimes that's money from the systems, right?
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.820]   But if we do that, my goodness,
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:17.540]   look at the payoff of that.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:22.700]   - What is your thought about anxiety and ADHD
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:27.260]   as a separate phenomenon in terms of medication?
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.020]   - Again, ADHD is the thing
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.900]   that seems to come up most in questions.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.820]   I can't tell you the number of, especially students,
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:37.100]   but also young working professionals
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:41.740]   and even people who are outside those categories
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.020]   who are interested in or are taking
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:50.860]   Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, R-Modafinil, or Vyvanse
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.620]   because they seem to struggle focusing without it,
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:57.460]   or, and I don't know 'cause I'm not one of those individuals,
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:01.580]   or because they seem to just like how well they can focus
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.540]   when they do take those compounds.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.340]   And so my understanding is these compounds
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:09.340]   mainly increase dopaminergic transmission in the brain,
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.420]   also adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain,
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.660]   so they're more or less stimulants.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.260]   They look a lot like, at least chemically,
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.100]   they look a lot like cocaine and amphetamine,
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:20.020]   although they're not quite cocaine and amphetamine.
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.340]   So should we be concerned about this?
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.620]   Is this a different sort of epidemic?
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:28.460]   Can these drugs be used to train the brain to focus
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.860]   and then people can withdraw from these drugs?
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.020]   I mean, I think this is a huge topic
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.700]   and one that maybe warrants its own episode entirely,
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.540]   but as long as we're on the topic,
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:40.100]   what are your thoughts about medication for ADHD?
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.340]   - Sure, I think medication for ADHD
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.900]   can be extremely effective.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.700]   And the studies show us that, right?
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.660]   They show us that if there is ADD,
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.460]   then medication for ADD is very, very helpful.
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.220]   And that's true in youths.
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.460]   It seems to be true if adults have adult ADHD or ADD,
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.380]   like we kind of know that's true,
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:05.140]   but all attention deficit
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.940]   is not attention deficit disorder, right?
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:11.940]   And there we go to the reflexive 15 minute visits,
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.860]   throw medicines at things, right?
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.620]   Attention deficit can come from many, many places.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.460]   And one of them is anxiety, right?
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.940]   There's so many other reasons, depression affects attention,
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.340]   poor sleep affects attention, poor diet can affect attention,
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.780]   stress in life can affect attention.
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:32.180]   So, and certainly trauma and the thing,
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:35.180]   the problems that trauma spins off can affect attention.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:38.260]   So, you know, this is really the truth
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:42.900]   that while teaching once about medicines and pharmacology,
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.780]   I was frustrated about how the answer to everything
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:47.940]   was like, what medicine do we use?
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:48.860]   What medicine do we use?
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:51.620]   As opposed to like, this is just one piece of the puzzle.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.660]   And I told an anecdote,
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.460]   which I think it was a clinical anecdote.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.540]   Like, what do you think is going on?
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:00.500]   And I think that if I told that to,
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.740]   I don't know, middle school students or something,
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.020]   they would probably say,
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.820]   you just told the story of a person
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.460]   with a rock in their shoe,
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.780]   which is the story that I was actually telling, right?
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:13.220]   But several people I was talking to,
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.220]   they're physicians, right?
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.660]   ADD, right?
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.340]   It's like, no, every time the person steps down,
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.980]   the rock hurts and they're not able
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.620]   to maintain attention, right?
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.980]   Like, that's what's going on.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:27.140]   But we're so programmed to think about medicines
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.940]   and inappropriate use of ADD medicines.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.180]   As you said, there's dopaminergic impact.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.580]   There's epinephrine, norepinephrine impact.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.460]   We're affecting what are called prefrontal alpha-2 receptors
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:41.380]   that like really need to be helped if there's real ADD.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:44.620]   But if there isn't, that is not a good thing to do,
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.680]   which is why it is quite fascinating
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.980]   that when people have ADD,
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:52.200]   they tolerate generally stimulants very well
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   without the other problems that can come of stimulants.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.700]   And again, I don't claim to know why that is,
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.780]   but we see that phenomenon.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.840]   But when people are being treated for ADD
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.120]   and they don't have ADD,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.900]   which sometimes they know they don't have ADD,
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.540]   but the stimulants make them function better,
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.620]   so they go to somebody and get the stimulants,
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.340]   that's not a good thing to do, right?
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:15.080]   'Cause stimulants, when they're not needed over time,
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.000]   they do affect our physical function.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.540]   They affect our judgment, right?
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.820]   There are a lot of negative things that come from that.
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:22.900]   They can affect the vigilance inside of us.
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:26.680]   So yes, it's a valid diagnosis,
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.540]   but it gets made when it's not present very often,
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:32.500]   which we see with a lot of diagnoses
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.660]   that you can throw medicine at.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.840]   We see the same thing with bipolar disorder.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.500]   True bipolar disorder is extremely important
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.600]   to utilize medicines effectively.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.180]   But how many people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.820]   if they absolutely don't have bipolar disorder?
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.840]   But it can be a catch-all diagnosis
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.340]   because there's, in a sense,
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.860]   something to do for it, in quotes, right?
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.580]   And you can throw medicine at it, right?
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.680]   So, I mean, what do we expect, right?
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.320]   If we have a healthcare system
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.540]   where you have 15-minute visits with your psychiatrist,
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.500]   of course we're gonna throw medicines at everything.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.120]   And then the training paradigms
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.380]   are gonna look at it through that lens.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.780]   And then very often, again, I gave the example
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.980]   of seeing somebody on seven medicines.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.060]   I mean, the first thought I have is,
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.100]   how many of those medicines are actually counterproductive?
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.040]   And a lot of the time, it's not like,
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.060]   oh, every now and then one is counterproductive.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.580]   No, that's the case.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.380]   That's the case a lot of the time.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.180]   And again, I come back to,
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:28.740]   if we're not putting thought into it,
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.700]   what other result would we expect?
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.060]   - Thank you for that answer.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.500]   I'm very curious what constitutes
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.980]   negative effects of stimulants.
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:40.660]   So if somebody's taking Adderall or Ritalin
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:43.180]   in order to work longer hours or focus
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.780]   because they have attention deficit,
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.860]   but not necessarily ADHD.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.580]   And again, I'm not recommending anyone do this.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.980]   I've just heard the numbers that have come back,
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:52.880]   at least from surveys and discussions
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.060]   with colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.260]   other college campuses,
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:59.340]   that upwards of 75% of college students
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.140]   use semi-regularly these drugs off,
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   not by prescription, just to study and to learn.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.180]   - Yes.
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:09.820]   - I can imagine sleep issues because these are stimulants.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.500]   What sorts of other issues can they create
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.820]   for people, problems they can create?
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.840]   - I think a touchstone maybe for,
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.620]   that's running through our conversation, right?
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:21.620]   Is prioritizing the short-term benefit
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.540]   over solving a long-term problem, right?
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:27.060]   Which we might say is a human tendency.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.940]   And we see it across the topics that we're discussing.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:32.940]   So short-term use of stimulants,
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.060]   sure, people are more alert.
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:35.660]   They can stay awake more.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.360]   They can study more intensely and longer.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.580]   Okay, there's some short-term benefit of that.
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:43.420]   Over there, even there, there can be problems, right?
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:46.240]   But we can say, let's just say for sake of argument
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.080]   that in the short term,
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.400]   there's something to be gained by doing that, right?
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.460]   But, oh my goodness, there's so much that is,
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.200]   there's so much risk to that, right?
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.100]   And how many times have I seen someone
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:57.960]   who they're doing that
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.180]   and they're just doing that to study, right?
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:02.860]   And now they're addicted to the amphetamines
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:06.320]   and their behavior changes and they don't know it.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.420]   Talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive,
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:14.380]   sort of suspicious outward look, view of the world,
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.140]   that we see a lot of that.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.700]   So we see judgment impairment.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.900]   We see heightened levels of anxiety.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.900]   We see more impulsivity in decision-making.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.880]   And sometimes we can get to the point
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.260]   of seeing frank psychosis.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.700]   Now that's not common,
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.040]   but have I seen young people
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.100]   who've done exactly what you're describing, right?
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:37.420]   They're using Adderall or they're using Ritalin to study.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.000]   And then I see them when they're coming into the hospital,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.080]   they're screaming about how someone's trying to hurt them.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.660]   Boy, then it's the worst case scenario,
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.000]   but it shows like that's where that can go.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.940]   And how much is there between the,
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.200]   oh, I'm just using it to study
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.060]   and that severe outcome
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:56.720]   that is actually quite negative for a person.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.800]   It might change how they think about that friendship
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.320]   or that relationship, right?
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.680]   A lot negative happens when we change our brains
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.340]   without an ability to see like,
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.140]   what is it actually doing to us?
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.580]   Which is part of my whole theme about trauma, right?
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.460]   It changes our brains and we don't know it, right?
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:15.460]   Well, the same is often true
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.960]   of amphetamines used inappropriately.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.940]   It shifts our brain and we don't realize
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.300]   that we're a little bit more impulsive
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.820]   in our decision-making, a little bit less trusting.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.820]   These are significant negative things
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.240]   that if we don't know it,
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.580]   person will just say,
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:30.700]   oh, I'm just using it to study.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:32.460]   I'm using it to work more.
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:36.720]   That's not without its high level of risk.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.640]   - What are your thoughts on cannabis?
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.800]   I've said it many times on this podcast before.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.640]   I'll say again,
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.020]   I feel fortunate that I've never really been attracted
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.540]   to alcohol or drugs of any kind,
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:52.380]   so much so that if all the alcohol and all the marijuana
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.060]   and all the cocaine and amphetamine disappeared,
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:59.180]   I wouldn't notice any change in my life, right?
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.220]   And I feel lucky in that way
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.680]   'cause I know a lot of people feel an attraction
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.320]   to these things as almost a gravitational force
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.380]   from their first drink, they just feel,
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:09.940]   I once heard it described in this,
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:12.180]   I think it was in an Augustan Burroughs book, "Dry,"
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.380]   where he was an alcoholic.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.420]   He said that the first drink he had,
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.260]   it felt like this magic elixir
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:20.380]   that meshed with the physiology of his blood
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:21.700]   in the most seamless way.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.520]   And as I was reading this, I thought, oh my goodness,
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.540]   first of all, that's the most foreign experience for me
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.060]   in terms of alcohol.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:32.200]   And second, gosh, that must be terrible,
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.660]   and you can, but at the same time,
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:34.500]   you could really understand
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.900]   why someone would be drawn to that.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:40.380]   So cannabis nowadays is legal or decriminalized
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.380]   in many areas of the US.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:46.020]   A lot of people seem to use the argument,
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.020]   it's better than drinking,
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:53.100]   or they only do it for sleep or anxiety management.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.660]   I'm not looking to demonize or support the cannabis.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.260]   So what are your thoughts about cannabis
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:01.300]   for anxiety management, depression,
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.820]   and maybe even for ADHD for that matter?
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:07.940]   - Sure, if I could make an alcohol comment, right?
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.060]   The number of times I've seen alcohol,
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.100]   like having been a good idea for coping with something,
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.260]   it approaches zero, right?
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:18.980]   The alcohol for coping is just never good.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.780]   And there's an additional risk factor
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.580]   that there are certain genetic profiles
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.460]   where people respond strongly to alcohol,
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.180]   like as you're saying, it's not just,
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.460]   oh, there's a little bit of short-term relief of distress,
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.460]   but there's a sort of euphoric response.
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:36.380]   And those genetics, we don't understand them completely.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.600]   They seem to be in Northern European populations,
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.260]   more prevalent as you had West in Northern Europe.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:45.700]   So we understand that where risk factors are demographically,
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.940]   but we can't pinpoint that for any one person.
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:50.060]   And there's a tremendous risk of that
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:52.660]   when a person responds so strongly to alcohol
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.700]   or habituates coping to alcohol.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.520]   Cannabis is a little bit of a different story.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.700]   I mean, how I have seen that play out,
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:02.860]   and again, this isn't coming from any expertise
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:06.300]   around the neuropharmacology of it,
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.260]   like how is this really working in the brain?
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.660]   It comes from an observation that what it seems to do
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:15.220]   is to narrow our attentional perspective, right?
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.500]   So it's why people will say,
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.420]   well, they wanna use cannabis before watching a movie
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:20.700]   with friends or something, right?
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:24.220]   And I think, okay, I think why people are doing that
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.340]   is because a cognitive spectrum narrows,
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:29.500]   and then instead of worrying about that thing at work
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.340]   or that relationship issue, one can just be present, right?
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:36.460]   For it gates out other attentional intrusions, right?
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.340]   So in some ways, I mean,
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.700]   I've absolutely seen it be helpful to people.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:43.340]   I mean, it's been legalized in Oregon,
[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:45.460]   which is where I spent a lot of my time,
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.540]   and it's not where all of my practice is.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:50.340]   But what I have seen is it is at times helpful,
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:51.580]   say, around sleep, right?
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:54.300]   Because a person can gate out other intrusive thoughts
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.420]   and they can just relax and go to sleep.
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:58.900]   But there can be another side of that too
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:01.140]   that at higher levels of distress,
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.140]   at higher levels of tension,
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:06.500]   what it can do is narrow the focus of cognition
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.740]   to the thing that is negative, right?
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.340]   So the idea that, oh, this is a treatment
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.060]   for depression, anxiety, trauma is not true, right?
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.900]   Can it be helpful under certain circumstances?
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.540]   Like, I think the answer to that is yeah.
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:22.780]   I mean, I know the answer to that is yes
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:24.940]   'cause I've seen it play out clinically that way,
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:27.380]   but it can also be harmful too.
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:30.300]   So there again, like anything that has any power,
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.180]   power to influence our brains,
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.300]   we wanna be thoughtful and careful about it.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:36.780]   I mean, do I think that it's safer than alcohol?
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:40.060]   Yes, I mean, I think we so clearly see that.
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.380]   Does that mean it was just uniformly safe?
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:43.460]   No, right?
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.780]   So we wanna be respectful of anything
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:48.140]   that can change how our brain is working.
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.340]   And I think that certainly includes alcohol
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.700]   and I think it certainly includes cannabis too.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:58.180]   - I'd love to talk about psychedelics for two reasons.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:01.460]   One, there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:04.620]   in psychedelics as a therapeutic clinical tool.
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.220]   I know there's also recreational use
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.620]   and I'll just preface all this by saying that my stance is
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.020]   we absolutely know for sure
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.660]   that these are controlled substances.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.780]   They're illegal to possess, sell or use
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.780]   in most of the country.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.700]   There are a few areas where they are decriminalized
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.700]   and psychedelics is a broad category, of course,
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.420]   and we can touch on some of the different ones.
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:32.260]   But whereas five years or so,
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:34.620]   five years ago or so, I was truly afraid
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.460]   to say the word psychedelics in any kind of public venue.
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:41.420]   There are laboratories at Stanford working on ketamine,
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:45.540]   psilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal models.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:48.380]   There's terrific work going on
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:49.940]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.300]   and Matthew Johnson's lab and others
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.780]   looking at the clinical applications
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.380]   mainly of high dose psilocybin and LSD.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:58.300]   There's the MAPS trials with MDMA.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:01.780]   So nowadays it's safe for an academic like me
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:02.980]   to say the word psychedelics.
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:05.700]   And I'd love to approach this question of psychedelics
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.780]   from a place of true exploration and curiosity,
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:11.940]   but with the preface that we're talking about this
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.180]   in a legal clinical setting.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.220]   And the legality is something that's now in process.
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:22.300]   I don't think it's completed, but that's my understanding.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:24.180]   But there are trials.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:29.180]   You can go to clinicaltrials.gov and put in MDMA
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:30.780]   and you'll see a bunch of clinical trials
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.660]   that are happening in the recruiting subjects.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:36.540]   So I think it's safe to have the conversation now.
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.940]   And I'd love your thoughts about psychedelics.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.220]   Maybe we could start with psilocybin and LSD
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:46.140]   as a broad category of drugs that at least my understanding
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:49.380]   is they touch on mainly the serotonin system,
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:52.620]   some specific receptor activation and modulation
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:55.980]   tend to change notions of space and time,
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:57.540]   adjust internal state.
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.820]   Maybe we would start there
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.780]   and then maybe venture into some of the other ones.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.340]   So what are your thoughts on these drugs
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.940]   for therapeutic potential,
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:07.860]   also potential hazards, et cetera?
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:10.340]   - Yeah, I think if we look at the true psychedelic,
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:13.980]   so psilocybin and LSD, like ketamine and MDMA,
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:15.620]   they're different categories of medicine.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:19.060]   They're these sort of novel tools to bring to bear.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:22.980]   But if we start with psilocybin, LSD, true psychedelics,
[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:27.980]   I think why they have gained so much momentum
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:31.140]   over the last several years is because the data
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:35.660]   coming from the labs and the academic centers
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.060]   is so powerfully positive.
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.740]   And as someone who's, I'm interested in anything
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.900]   that's potentially helpful, right?
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:44.540]   And I wanna learn and understand that
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:47.180]   because a lot of things that are potentially helpful,
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.820]   you go and look at the data and you see
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:51.220]   that that's not helpful or that's harmful.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.980]   I think what we have seen with psychedelics
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:56.860]   is that they're so helpful, right?
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:58.660]   And the trials are bearing that out.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.140]   And of course, these are used in professional hands
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.740]   and with the right kind of guidance
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:06.180]   are extremely powerful tools, but used in the right way
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.300]   by someone who knows how to utilize them
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:10.140]   in the right set and setting
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.140]   can have an immense positive impact.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:16.740]   And that's why I think that the thought is there
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.500]   across people and more and more people feel comfortable
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.380]   saying it and talking about it.
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:23.100]   I mean, we're in the state of Oregon now
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:26.500]   where the thought is we're moving towards legalization
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.780]   of psilocybin early in 2023.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:32.300]   And it's part of the new data, right?
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.660]   And how it meshes with the older data, right?
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:37.500]   How it meshes with data from the '60s and '70s
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:40.140]   that showed such a strong, powerful impact
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:41.300]   of these medicines.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:42.660]   And I have a whole set of thoughts
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.620]   about what's happening there
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.700]   and they're just, they're conjectures, right?
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.180]   But my read of, you know,
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:51.820]   as best I can try and understand the neuroscience
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:56.540]   and the clinical applicability and the changes is,
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:59.620]   you know, what happens is we see less communication,
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:03.180]   less chatter in the outer parts of the brain, right?
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:04.740]   In the outer parts of the cortex.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.660]   And I think that as human beings,
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.780]   we sort of glorify the parts of the brain
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.500]   that only we have.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.860]   I mean, certainly in my growing up, right?
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:16.100]   I mean, what did I learn?
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.780]   Even if you think about like learning about the brain
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.860]   in high school, right?
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.420]   I learned that like, wow, we're great as humans
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.020]   'cause we have language and other animals don't
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.660]   and we can use tools and like, aren't we so great
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.380]   because we have this part of the brain
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:31.700]   that other animals don't and it lets us function, right?
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:34.660]   Okay, there's some truth to that, right?
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:37.540]   That we can do things others can't do
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:42.540]   but we get lost often in the outer parts of the cortex
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:46.340]   which I think are about survival, right?
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.300]   So we come back to the things you and I talked about
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.420]   early on of like, why are these trauma mechanisms in us?
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.700]   Right, so much of what's going on in our brains
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.100]   is about survival.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:58.540]   And I think living, so to speak, in the cortex, right?
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:01.780]   In the outer part of the brain is consistent
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:03.540]   with a focus on survival.
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:05.100]   So if you think that's where language is,
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:08.020]   that's where vision is, that's where executive function is,
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.980]   so planning and task execution.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.420]   So, so much of that is about making our way
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.420]   in the world around us.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:18.340]   So we tend to glorify that and think,
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:21.380]   well, that's in a sense where our existence is, right?
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:24.140]   And I believe that is not true, right?
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:25.700]   And again, can I say that for sure?
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.900]   Of course not, right?
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.420]   But my read of 20 years of doing clinical work
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:31.380]   and thinking about all sorts of medicines
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:35.740]   and thinking about the psychedelics in a lot of depth,
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:36.820]   I think that what they do
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.220]   is they take us out of the cortex, right?
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:41.340]   'Cause that's where we run into these problems.
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.700]   That's where we bounce things over and over again,
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.820]   that the distress centers deep in our brain,
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:48.540]   in the brainstem, kind of ally
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.900]   with the outer parts of the cortex.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.700]   And they say, right, we're in distress,
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.220]   we wanna stay alive.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.420]   Often a lot of us have had trauma
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:58.340]   that makes these changes in the brain.
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:50:59.780]   And then we're thinking all the time,
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:02.620]   like what would I do if there were war?
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.340]   What would I do if there's civil war, if someone bombs us?
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:07.740]   What will I do if the economy collapses, right?
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:09.380]   What will I do if somebody gets sick?
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:12.180]   We're thinking all this future projection
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:15.660]   that is all coming from a place of fear, right?
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:18.340]   It's all coming from a desire to think about things
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.700]   and control the future with this part of the brain
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:23.660]   that is so uniquely human, right?
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:26.220]   And I think when we take the neurotransmission
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.100]   out of those places, right,
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.180]   and we set it in a part of the brain
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.220]   and say the insular cortex, right?
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.820]   The parts of the brain that are sort of in the middle,
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.540]   right, which I think,
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:39.460]   I believe is where our humanness really is.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.220]   So the psychedelics make there be less chatter,
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:44.660]   communication in these other parts of the brain,
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:48.020]   and then we become seated in the part of the brain
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:51.140]   that I believe is most about our experience
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:52.620]   of true humanness.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.380]   Which is why when you read about people
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.220]   who have experiences, and I've heard about them,
[01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.700]   people talk to me about this, right?
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:01.340]   They've utilized it, they talk with me.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.340]   So whether it's someone telling me their story
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:05.420]   or it's coming from research data,
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:07.980]   you know, it's why people can sort of see with clarity
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.860]   that, oh, that trauma,
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:13.060]   like that thing is not my fault.
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.260]   Or like we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:18.060]   We relieve ourselves, release ourselves from guilt.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.420]   And it's like, why is this so helpful to people?
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:24.260]   And I think it's because it can do
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:27.160]   what we are trying to get at in good therapy.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.340]   But it can really catalyze that
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:32.480]   by just putting a person in that part of the brain
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.660]   that can see it for what it is
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.020]   without all that chatter in the cortex
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:38.240]   about how you gotta think it's your fault
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.220]   or you won't avoid it again.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.020]   And that makes the repetition compulsion.
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.780]   How do I think ahead to the next thing that might happen?
[01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:44.440]   And what else bad might happen?
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.460]   I mean, we don't get anywhere doing that.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.540]   And I think where we get somewhere
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:51.100]   is when we seat ourselves deeper in the brain,
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.840]   which I think we do if we're like doing really good therapy
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.820]   and we're, you know, we're in the deep parts of the brain.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:01.260]   But these psychedelics, the medicinal value, I believe,
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.640]   is putting us in that part of the brain
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.620]   where a person can really find truth.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:08.780]   And that's why I think that it's come so far
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.380]   in these few years,
[01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:14.380]   because I think that is very clinically evident.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:16.160]   And I think we're gonna see more and more
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:20.580]   the value of that and how what the psychedelics do
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:23.740]   can become, I believe, a heuristic for understanding like,
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:26.440]   wait, how are our brains really functioning?
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.720]   And what are the parts that really matter
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.600]   to our experience of being human?
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.000]   It's those parts of the brain, right?
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.700]   The deep parts of the brain, the insular cortex,
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:38.520]   and the areas around it that say light up
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.760]   when a person has an experience of spiritual ecstasy
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:45.800]   or an experience of connection with another person, right?
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.120]   So we kind of have these telltale markers
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.900]   that something is going on there
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.360]   that's very important and very special.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.860]   And I think we're more attracted
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.060]   to the outer parts of the brain
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.900]   because they're easier to study, right?
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.700]   I mean, as you know better than I do,
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:01.220]   we started studying the brain through lesion studies, right?
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:03.340]   'Cause it was easier to see if a person got hurt
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.180]   in this part of the brain
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.820]   or had a stroke in that part of the brain, what changes.
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:09.720]   So we look at the cortex 'cause one, it's easier to study
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.580]   and we tend to glorify it.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:14.740]   And I think that has been misguided.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:18.140]   And I think that we're learning
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:20.100]   about how that's been misguided
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.580]   through the study of these novel modalities
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.100]   from Western perspectives, but of course,
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.460]   they've been used for a long, long time in other cultures,
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.660]   but novel from our perspective.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:32.140]   - Yeah, I'm fascinated by this idea
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:34.260]   that in these middle brain structures
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:36.680]   is where our humanity lies.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.280]   And as you said, I also wonder whether or not
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.160]   other animals experience life more from that orientation
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.200]   with less chatter.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.860]   We can only guess, but the dog lover
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.020]   and being in the presence of animals
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.460]   that seem to just be present in what's happening
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.540]   in their immediate environment,
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:59.540]   not too much anticipation. - Right, I mean,
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:02.140]   what you're talking about is sentience as important.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:04.500]   And sentience is extremely important, right?
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.920]   And if we're going to overvalue, say, language,
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.500]   then I think we undervalue sentience, right?
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.040]   Which is why I think we tend to undervalue animals, right?
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.500]   And they're suffering because, well,
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.140]   they're not saying anything about it, right?
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:17.980]   And, you know, they're not writing about it.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:19.900]   So, okay, it's easy to ignore.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.340]   And we think about, again, the hubris of that, right?
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.280]   The, oh, because we can think and talk and write,
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:27.500]   like we must be feeling more than species
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.340]   that don't do that.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:31.060]   I mean, I think that that is so true
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.660]   and that we're going to understand more about sentience
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.560]   in other species and how, you know,
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.700]   that's at the core of existence.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:43.500]   And my hope would be that we value more humans and animals,
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.500]   right, through the evolution of that understanding.
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:52.380]   - The hallucinations that accompany psychedelics like LSD
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.660]   and psilocybin have such an attractive force to them
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:56:00.080]   as a concept and as an experience.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.500]   And so I think most often when people hear hallucinogens,
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:07.700]   they think, and psychedelics, they think about hallucinating.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:08.540]   - Right.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:09.360]   - It makes sense why they would.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:12.460]   But what's so interesting to me is nothing in your answer
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:16.020]   about psychedelics, psilocybin and LSD focused
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:17.860]   on hallucinations per se.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.820]   It was more about feeling states, accessing a feeling state
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:24.420]   or a relation to an event or to a person or to oneself.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.280]   Maybe even I caught hints of maybe even empathy
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.680]   for oneself for the first time.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.060]   None of that had to do with seeing sounds
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:36.140]   or hearing colors and, you know,
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:39.020]   these kind of cliche statements about hallucinations.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.500]   So I am aware of laboratories,
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.060]   one at University of California Davis in particular,
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:46.620]   but a few others that are trying to generate
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.300]   chemical variants of psychedelics
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.940]   that lack the hallucinogenic properties,
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:56.740]   but maintain these other properties as therapeutic tools.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:59.260]   And as I say that, I realize that people
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:02.260]   in the psychedelic community are probably thinking,
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:03.100]   oh, that's horrible.
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.980]   That's the dismantling of the core thing.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.600]   But the simple question is,
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.740]   do you think the hallucinations are valuable for anything?
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.260]   - And I think we're really getting
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:14.700]   into the philosophical, right?
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.900]   The ontological, right?
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.980]   There's this sort of trying to understand being, right?
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:22.420]   And I don't claim to know the answer to that.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:26.660]   I think that at times it seems like the hallucinations
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:31.660]   have a metaphorical or a symbolic way of being helpful,
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:36.020]   right, because people will come to understand things
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:41.020]   that they hold dear and true after the experience, right?
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:43.980]   That often, not always,
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:46.900]   come through the lens of the hallucination.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:50.260]   So are the hallucinations necessary?
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:53.660]   Are those hallucinations sometimes important, sometimes not?
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:55.860]   I mean, I think we don't understand that,
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.900]   and I think we want to be respectful
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.900]   of the sort of mystery of that.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.500]   But what I think is fascinating is,
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.680]   you think about substance abuse and what that means is,
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.580]   well, one aspect of that is that a person has experiences,
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.700]   thoughts, conceptions of self in the world
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:12.060]   with the substance that,
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.260]   without the substance, they know are wrong, right?
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:16.460]   People talk about liquid courage, right?
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:17.660]   And, "Okay, I feel better about myself
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.420]   and I feel courageous 'cause I've had a couple of drinks.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.340]   Now, after that, I feel normal about myself
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.260]   and that was false," right?
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:26.340]   And we see that.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.700]   That's part of what substance intoxication means, right?
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:33.500]   But what we see with the psychedelic medicines
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:35.860]   is something that's incredibly different, right?
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:39.300]   That people are having experiences that are so de-linked
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:42.160]   from our normal experience of reality.
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.100]   And then when they come, in a sense, back online,
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.680]   in a normal cognitive way, they realize like,
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.780]   "Wow, now I'm applying all those mechanisms
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:52.440]   of trying to understand truth to that
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.980]   and what I see is that it's true and wow, it's true."
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:58.480]   Like, I mean, we hear that all the time, which tells me,
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.100]   "Hey, something different is going on there."
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.620]   And of course, these are powerful tools, so misused,
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:05.340]   like very bad things can happen.
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:07.260]   But you think about the clinical utility
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:10.740]   and what does it mean that so many people
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:14.380]   change for the healthier or even change their lives
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:17.060]   after an experience because it so resonates.
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:19.220]   It's like, "Oh, now I understand something that's true."
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:20.740]   And it's not something bizarre.
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.560]   It's like, "I wasn't responsible for being raped that time."
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:27.900]   Or, "I'm not less than, even though my sexuality
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.260]   or my gender identity is different
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:31.580]   from some silly binary concept," right?
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.140]   Like people kind of often get it
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:34.800]   and they feel differently about themselves
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.700]   and guilt and shame are impacted.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.580]   So I think we're likely to see
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:42.480]   that they are powerful anti-trauma mechanisms,
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.780]   again, used clinically in the right hands.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.760]   And I think that we're also gonna see
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:49.380]   that they're heuristic for understanding our brain
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:52.940]   that goes against what I see as some of the reflexive hubris
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.820]   of, "Well, the outer parts must be the best
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.920]   because that's what makes us human
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.060]   and other animals don't have it
[01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:59.320]   and we're better because we're human."
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.180]   It means it makes no sense, you know?
[02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.860]   - I'd like to talk about MDMA.
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.580]   And I'll preface this by saying I was a participant,
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:08.540]   actually, technically I'm still a participant
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:09.660]   in a clinical trial.
[02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:12.960]   So I have experience of doing it twice.
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:16.880]   The trial involves three separate dosings of this.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:21.400]   I was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial,
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.700]   mostly because I was aware
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.340]   there can be some cardiac effects.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:27.440]   And I liked the idea there'd be a clinician on hand.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.220]   And I'll just say that I found the experiences
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.900]   to be profound, beneficial,
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:38.940]   and very different from one session to the next.
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.940]   The first one felt a whole collection of ideas
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:47.800]   and relational things came up
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:49.780]   that felt very powerful and transformative.
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:51.900]   And I do think that I learned there.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.860]   I exported a number of things.
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:56.100]   My particular experience isn't relevant here,
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:59.020]   but the second time I expected it to be the same way.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:03.120]   And it was very mellow and relaxing
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.560]   and was deeply tied to kind of notions of acceptance.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:11.240]   So there weren't all these revelations and wow, new insights.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:13.860]   It was very much about sort of grounding
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:16.520]   into a kind of a calmer state.
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:20.260]   So I have the personal experience of benefiting from these
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.060]   in ways that I think still benefit me
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:25.460]   and was very struck by the power of MDMA.
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.820]   And my very crude understanding of the pharmacology
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:31.260]   and the state that is being under MDMA
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:35.280]   is that it encourages or increases dopaminergic transmission
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.480]   but also serotonergic transmission,
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.600]   which is, to my knowledge,
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.320]   a kind of a rare state for the brain to be in.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:42.940]   That typically it's more of a seesaw
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:46.180]   of dopaminergic drive towards external goals
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.120]   or more serotonergic drive towards more placidity
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.460]   or comfort with what one already has.
[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:55.020]   And so with both those systems amplified,
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.820]   the only way I can describe it subjectively
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.620]   is that everything sort of funneled back in
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:03.180]   and it was almost like a pursuit of inner landscape.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:06.540]   And I can only imagine what it would be like
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:10.500]   in the context of doing this with somebody else
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:11.620]   also taking MDMA.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.640]   I have no idea what that's like.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.240]   That's my report of the experience.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:18.060]   I know that the experience can vary.
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:20.780]   What are your thoughts about the chemistry
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:24.900]   and what sorts of states do you think MDMA is creating
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:29.460]   that can explain why it's a useful therapeutic tool
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:32.980]   in some cases and what sorts of cases those might be?
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:34.080]   - Sure, sure.
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:37.900]   To clarify, I think part of what we're starting with
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:40.860]   is like this is very different than the psychedelics, right?
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.380]   Which are seeding our consciousness
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:44.540]   in these deep centers of the brain, right?
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:48.100]   Whereas what MDMA is doing is sort of flooding
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:50.480]   with positive neurotransmitters, right?
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.780]   In certain parts of the brain.
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:55.460]   And I think what that creates is a greater permissiveness
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.460]   inside to entertain or approach different things, right?
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:03.760]   So I think where we see it's tremendous,
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.240]   my read of the data is around potentially,
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.960]   and we're seeing in some of the trials, right?
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:10.360]   Tremendous benefit for trauma, right?
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.480]   And you think about what we were talking about earlier,
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.860]   how this reflexive guilt, shame,
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:17.320]   hypervigilance, avoidance, right?
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.960]   And when these systems are flooded
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.520]   with these neurotransmitters,
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:23.900]   it's more permissive to sort of think about that, right?
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:25.580]   And to think about that without, again,
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.840]   all the chatter of that's your fault,
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.820]   or you're never gonna get anywhere because of that,
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:31.500]   or you know what that means, right?
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:33.620]   They can kind of go away and then we can think about it
[02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:36.800]   in a way that isn't through the lens of fear, right?
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:39.080]   And I think that's the power there
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:42.360]   is that it's permissive of approaching something,
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.600]   contemplating something, you know, a different, a novelty.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:48.620]   We talk about a de novo approach.
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:51.700]   And I think that's also why the experience can vary
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:54.080]   because you could also see how
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.680]   if you're not thinking about something, right?
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.260]   So there's not a clinical guidance to it.
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:01.380]   You could be in a state where like,
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:02.720]   I just feel good, right?
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.480]   And I'm thinking about good things
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.440]   and like that can feel good, right?
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.520]   But that's not necessarily problem solving, right?
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:11.240]   So the clinical guidance says,
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:15.240]   hey, let's take that state and do something with it, right?
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:16.800]   Now that you're in this state,
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.140]   hey, let's make cable, the sun is shining, right?
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:21.500]   You're in a state where we can look at things
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:22.880]   that are traumatic, right?
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:25.800]   We can approach them from a de novo perspective.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:26.800]   And I think it's part,
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.240]   I think that explains why you had these different experiences
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.500]   from one to the other,
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.060]   because your brain is just in a state
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:34.160]   that's conducive to something, right?
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:37.700]   But if there's not the mechanism to have that thing happen,
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.740]   like conducive to something therapeutic,
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.420]   then you might go there on your own,
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:43.260]   or you might just be in a state
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:46.640]   where you have a sense of wellbeing and you sit with that.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.340]   - Which sort of seems like a waste to me.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:51.980]   I mean, this is what I tell people when they ask about MDMA.
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.520]   I said, at least from my experience,
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:55.800]   that the potential hazard there
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.960]   is that in that very high dopaminergic,
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.200]   serotonergic state,
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.440]   there were moments where I felt like I could get excited
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:05.020]   about any one specific concept
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:08.100]   that I might even just think about, for instance,
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.800]   water and how nourishing it is,
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:13.020]   and really just go down the path of water and the world
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:13.860]   and all the water.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:18.380]   And you can, you're in a state that is very prone
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.900]   to suggestion, internal suggestion.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:22.300]   And so the guidance turned out,
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.740]   the guidance from the clinician turned out
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:26.420]   to be immensely valuable in allowing me
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.220]   to go into my own head for bits of time,
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:32.100]   but then also to resurface and share and exchange
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:33.580]   in a way that to,
[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:35.580]   I'm trying to really get something out of it
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:37.140]   that was useful and that I could export,
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:38.420]   because of course water is wonderful,
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:39.380]   but I'm not really interested
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.580]   in growing my relationship to water.
[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.620]   And I really felt like I could understand for the,
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:46.660]   I never went to raves or anything growing up,
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:48.740]   I never did MDMA recreationally,
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:50.440]   but I understood for the first time
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:52.980]   how people could get really attached to an environment
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.180]   and feel connected to things,
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.040]   because I think with all that serotonin,
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.500]   you just feel connected to everything around you.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.060]   So I think it's a slippery slope there.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.020]   And I don't know what the future
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:05.620]   of the clinical use of MDMA looks like,
[02:06:05.620 --> 02:06:08.180]   but I would hope that whoever's thinking about
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:11.140]   guiding these sessions is really thinking carefully
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:12.700]   also about evolving the practice
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:16.300]   to help people really move through in a sequential way
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:18.900]   so they can leave with something valuable.
[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:21.340]   - Yes, 100%, 100%.
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.700]   These are such powerful tools.
[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:25.180]   And again, if they're powerful tools
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:29.760]   and we're using them without respect for them, right?
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:32.340]   Without clinical guidance, we incur risk, right?
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:34.700]   I mean, you know, getting obsessed with water,
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:36.940]   well, and it probably isn't going to hurt you, right?
[02:06:36.940 --> 02:06:39.340]   But if someone is out using it,
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:40.740]   there's around other people,
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:43.060]   what one can feel positively about
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:44.920]   or become sort of obsessed in the short term about
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:46.300]   can be very counterproductive, right?
[02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:47.580]   There can be a lot of risk to that.
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:52.380]   So I think it anchors back to these are very powerful tools.
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.860]   We're coming to understand them much, much more,
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:56.260]   and we're coming to understand
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:59.220]   that they have immense potential to be helpful to us.
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:03.220]   But I think and hope that that only also increases
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:06.540]   our respect for those modalities
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:09.660]   and what can come, what negative can happen
[02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:11.860]   if we're not respectful.
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:13.040]   - It's going to be very interesting
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.300]   to see where all of this goes in the next few years,
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:16.940]   not just in Oregon, but elsewhere.
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:19.040]   It's one way or another, it's happening.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:22.180]   It seems to have a momentum that is not going to stop.
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.700]   So very exciting area to be sure.
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.180]   - I agree.
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:29.660]   - I have a question about language.
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:32.820]   In your book, you talk about how we need to be careful
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:35.140]   about the use of language around trauma
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:39.140]   and maybe problem solving and problem describing in general.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:43.260]   You know, at one extreme you hear that your brain
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:45.460]   and your body hear every word you say,
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.960]   and we have to be so careful with language.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:51.820]   And that actually frightened me for a number of years
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:53.080]   'cause I would hear that and I thought, gosh,
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:54.740]   if I just think that something is bad,
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:56.200]   now it's going to hurt me worse,
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:00.900]   which itself is part of that whole packing down of an issue.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:05.080]   Very hard to avoid thoughts without distraction.
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.300]   So that's one extreme.
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.020]   On the other hand, you know, I can say,
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:15.860]   I can tell somebody I love them with a tone of hatred.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.220]   I can tell somebody I hate them with a tone of love.
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:23.420]   So how should we think about language in parsing trauma?
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:25.300]   And in your book, you talk about,
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:28.180]   you give some cautionary notes about talking
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:30.580]   about depression, trauma, and PTSD
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.580]   in terms that might diminish their real severity
[02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:37.020]   in some cases.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:39.380]   And I was really struck by that.
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:40.760]   So maybe just touch on, you know,
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.160]   how should we talk about these things in a way
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.740]   that doesn't diminish them for ourselves
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.140]   or for other people?
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:49.380]   And at the same time honors the fact
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:51.700]   that there's a lot of trauma out there
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.820]   and there's a lot of depression out there
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.740]   and we need to talk about it.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:58.760]   - Yeah, I think this is a very complicated
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.580]   and in many ways convoluted topic.
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:03.060]   Like I think it's wonderful that we have language,
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:06.700]   but boy, language leads us astray often too.
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:09.500]   And you think about how people define words.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.100]   Like someone says a word, what is it?
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:13.500]   Does a person know what that word means?
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:15.220]   What nuance are they taking from it?
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.740]   That we just have to be very careful
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.380]   what we're saying and what we're communicating.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:21.760]   And I think this doesn't mean,
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:24.900]   because, you know, there's a sort of phenomenon now
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:27.180]   where people are trying to control language,
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.020]   I think too much.
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:28.940]   Like you can't say anything
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:30.580]   that someone else might find hurtful.
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:32.260]   You have to refer to people
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.140]   in ways they choose to be referred to,
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:37.260]   even if those are ways that others don't understand
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:39.220]   or ways they themselves have decided
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:42.180]   or ways that might be psychologically
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:43.780]   or clinically unhelpful.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:47.780]   So I think the over control of language is not good,
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:49.940]   but I think the specificity of language
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:51.320]   of what are we trying to say?
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.700]   How are we defining it?
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:53.860]   Even the word trauma, right?
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:54.780]   We're talking about trauma,
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:56.700]   so we want to define what that means, right?
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.400]   It doesn't just mean like, oh, anything kind of negative,
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.180]   right, because then that dilutes it down
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.660]   to meaning nothing, right?
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:07.660]   It also doesn't just mean, you know, injury in combat, right?
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:09.500]   Like we have to talk about what that is.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.260]   So I think anchoring it to something
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:13.160]   that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.060]   our coping skills and changing us,
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:17.100]   like then at least I define it that way
[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:18.860]   and I can communicate that to you
[02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:21.680]   and we can understand what we're talking about, right?
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.120]   I think that another aspect of language,
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:26.220]   while again, we need this middle ground
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:28.660]   and I don't think that it is okay
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:32.520]   for the over control of language to shut down expression,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:35.260]   but we also have to acknowledge, you know,
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:38.060]   how we're so much less distanced from each other
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.460]   through social media and I think social media
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:41.860]   can do very, very good things
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:44.000]   as hopefully we're doing now, right?
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.960]   But it can also be used to harm people from a distance,
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:52.020]   right, and how much hatefulness is there out there
[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:54.380]   that I think comes from anger and frustration in people,
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.020]   again, back to trauma, right,
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.600]   where people just want to be angry
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.140]   and it's not really issues that they're talking about,
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:02.560]   but then there's a target of that anger
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:06.200]   and, you know, people feel beleaguered by that
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:10.640]   and the words that people use sometimes are so awful
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:11.800]   that someone reading that,
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.260]   like if you're in the demographic
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:15.840]   that's being targeted, right, and you're reading that,
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:18.280]   I mean, how does a person not feel,
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.320]   not feel beset upon, vulnerable, right?
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.920]   And then I think that also fuels, you know,
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:27.440]   things like we just had this terrible shooting in Buffalo,
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.780]   right, like just hate motivated, right?
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:32.280]   And I think that because that kind of language
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.520]   becomes very real to people who may take it in,
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.680]   it fuels their hate and then they do something to enact it,
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:41.380]   which of course creates greater fear and vulnerability.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:44.760]   And I think there was some civility and decorum
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:47.800]   that was in our world not that long ago, right?
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:49.440]   I mean, you know, I'm in my early fifties,
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.840]   I'm not that old, right?
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.320]   But I remember a time when in political discourse,
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:56.960]   people were civil to one another, right?
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.080]   Now, so much, I mean, it's not all of it, right?
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:01.540]   But there's an acceptance of things
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.380]   that are just bombastic, right?
[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:05.900]   There's like, it's a circus sideshow sometimes
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.060]   of people being just angry and aggressive
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:11.820]   and it's not really linked to anything,
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:13.420]   although it's allegedly linked to something,
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.900]   but then other people's anger can attach to it
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:17.260]   and it's not about what it's about,
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.340]   but it's about aligning with the anger.
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:24.340]   And I think that there is so much damage
[02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:25.380]   that comes from that.
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.240]   And I think, you know, should we have,
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.960]   should it be okay that people sometimes are talking,
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:34.100]   communicating, using language in ways
[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:37.340]   that would like get us suspended from middle school, right?
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:39.680]   Ways I don't want my eight-year-old to see.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.760]   I mean, is that really okay?
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:43.640]   Or do we need to take a stand
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.140]   for like rational use of language?
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:47.860]   I don't want my use of language to be over-controlled
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:50.400]   by someone who thinks they sort of understand better
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.580]   than the rest of us how to communicate with those, okay?
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:53.420]   I don't want that.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:57.580]   It's stereotypically a sort of idea of the left, say, right?
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:12:59.060]   At least in our society.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:03.700]   But I also don't want language that can be so angry
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:07.580]   and so aggressive that it is perpetuating
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:12.060]   or spreading vulnerability and that it facilitates trauma.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.320]   And I think we could set standards as a society
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.660]   where we say, look, I don't want anybody in power
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:19.620]   who's gonna behave that way, right?
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:21.420]   I don't care if their whole agenda is like,
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:23.020]   make Paul Conte's life better.
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:25.120]   I'm still not gonna vote for you, right?
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.820]   If you're behaving towards others
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:28.120]   in a way that's denigrating,
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:31.580]   you're behaving in a way that I feel essentially ashamed of,
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:32.420]   right?
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:33.260]   And I feel that a lot, right?
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:36.220]   I see the politics, you know, I see things play out.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.580]   It's not always political.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:39.780]   Of course, not always political, but I see things play out.
[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:41.820]   And I think, oh my gosh, I feel embarrassed.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:43.900]   Like we're somehow okay with this.
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:44.860]   Well, it doesn't matter which side
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.460]   of the political spectrum it's coming to.
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:48.980]   And I think that's an indicator
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:53.980]   that what we're doing is really hurtful to us.
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:55.500]   People become more angry.
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:57.660]   They attach to the anger.
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:59.100]   People feel more beleaguered.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.600]   There's more divisions between us.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.860]   And it seems more and more like,
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:04.320]   well, we can only really identify with people
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:05.340]   who are just like us.
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.380]   And like, what does that really mean?
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:09.380]   I mean, the divisions that it creates between us.
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:13.420]   And that, you know, that promotes so many negative things.
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:14.260]   Right?
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.380]   I mean, think about ways in which it promotes
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:16.340]   white supremacy, right?
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:17.780]   It's just one example, right?
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:19.180]   And we've seen that play out,
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:21.780]   that this is really bad for us.
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:23.880]   And we've got to look at that.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.260]   I mean, if we don't look at that,
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:28.180]   I don't think it's always something is going to happen.
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.740]   Like something is happening, right?
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:31.080]   It's happening now.
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.860]   - Yeah, and it really, to my mind,
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:35.860]   it really seeps down into the soil
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:39.220]   of everything that we're talking about on all sides.
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.060]   - Yes.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.340]   - People are activated.
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:45.420]   People are upset about one thing or the other.
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:46.260]   - Right.
[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:47.860]   - And no one is immune from upset,
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:50.000]   regardless of political affiliation.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.040]   And everybody seems to be upset nowadays.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:55.220]   And as I was hearing you talk about this,
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:58.780]   I feel a lot of resonance with what you said,
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.260]   and I also am hoping you run for office.
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:03.100]   (laughing)
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:05.260]   - So I don't think I have the gumshoe for that,
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:06.740]   but thank you for that.
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:08.060]   - Oh, that would be wonderful.
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:09.180]   - Thank you.
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:11.500]   - I'd like to talk about a concept
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.020]   of taking care of oneself.
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.700]   This comes up in the book.
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.540]   - Yes.
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:18.240]   - This is something we talk a lot about on this podcast.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.340]   I mean, I think people have heard me blab endlessly
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.800]   and I'll probably go into the grave
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:25.120]   telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.540]   and to try and get proper sleep
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:31.500]   and to have a few tools for reducing their anxiety
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.680]   in real time and on and on and on.
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.340]   You know, we hear about this concept
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:37.700]   of taking care of oneself.
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:41.300]   And I think at a surface level,
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.180]   it can sound a little bit light.
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:46.140]   You know, oh, take care, take good care.
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:50.060]   But to me, it's a deep and powerful concept.
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:53.020]   And I was very happy to see it in your book
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:56.460]   and also to learn a lot of ideas
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.860]   about what that really looks like.
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:02.100]   Because whether or not somebody is in the early stages
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:04.300]   of considering whether or not they have trauma
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:06.380]   or is in the deep stages of working that through
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:09.460]   or has made it through the tunnel some distance,
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:12.980]   taking care of oneself is an ongoing process.
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:17.020]   I'd love for you to just describe
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:21.020]   what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinician.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:23.720]   And of course, the practices and things
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:25.300]   that you encourage people to do.
[02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:28.940]   But how should we think about taking care of oneself?
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:31.980]   Because on one extreme, you could imagine massages
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:36.640]   or treats, vacations and chefs for hire
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:39.420]   that take care of everything for ourselves.
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:41.700]   And on the other extreme, you could say,
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:44.660]   you know, leaning into life in a way
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.380]   that you're paying attention to small things
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:48.100]   while working very, very hard.
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:51.040]   So it's such a big concept.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:53.480]   But how do you think about taking care of oneself?
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:55.420]   How should I take care of myself?
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.980]   How should people take care of themselves?
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:57.900]   - Sure.
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:01.740]   I see here what I think is a very fascinating dichotomy,
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:03.180]   right, that in some ways,
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:05.680]   like think about how complex our brains are, right?
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.380]   How complex our psyches, our unconscious minds are.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.640]   There's so much complexity there.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:14.340]   But on the other hand, psychological concepts
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:18.460]   that are consistent with health are often very simple, right?
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:21.020]   By which I don't mean light, right?
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:23.980]   But simple, straightforward, right?
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:26.580]   And I think self-care is absolutely one of them.
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:28.020]   I mean, how much is talked about
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:29.500]   how to take care of oneself
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:32.280]   that just skips over the basics that are necessary
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:33.740]   as a building block for all else.
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:36.380]   So it doesn't matter how many chefs or vacations
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:38.100]   or whatever a person has,
[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:41.100]   if the basics of self-care aren't squared away.
[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:43.820]   And it's not a light concept to say like,
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:46.340]   look, are you sleeping enough, right?
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:47.500]   Are you eating well?
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.540]   Are you getting natural light?
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.080]   Are you interacting with people
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.000]   who are good to interact with, right?
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.440]   Are you accepting negative interactions in your life?
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.900]   Are you living in circumstances
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:00.420]   that make you feel okay or not?
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:03.940]   They're very, very basic premises,
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:07.740]   but so often we're not looking at them at all, right?
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:09.620]   We're not looking at them at all
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:12.020]   because we tend to skip over them.
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.220]   And we tend to skip over them either
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:16.360]   because again, in some automatic way
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.140]   that sometimes is trauma-driven
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:20.180]   or we're not gonna look at that, right?
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:21.940]   And often not taking care of ourselves
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:24.480]   can have the punishment, distraction, right?
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.020]   There's so much that can come into that
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:30.100]   or our sense of power is tied
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:31.420]   to not taking care of ourselves.
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:33.300]   I mean, I'll give you an example is
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.140]   I tend to, for whatever reason, do reasonably well
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:39.260]   with very poor self-care, right?
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:41.300]   And like that was very adaptive
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:43.140]   when I was in some medical training, right?
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:45.620]   And I'm like, okay, I can eat a lot today.
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:46.580]   I can not eat, right?
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:47.780]   I can sleep two hours.
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:49.840]   I can sleep eight, right?
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.740]   I mean, overall, that's not good.
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:54.340]   And it hasn't been good for me as I've aged,
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:55.980]   but then I realized, look,
[02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:58.060]   I'm doing all these things that make myself healthier,
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:00.260]   but like what, I ignore that, right?
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:01.300]   And why am I ignoring it?
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:02.120]   That was a key question.
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:03.140]   Why am I ignoring it?
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:05.220]   Because somewhere inside of me as it was,
[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:07.300]   and still to some extent is,
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:10.460]   this idea that my ability to be really functional, right?
[02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:13.060]   To generate success in the world around me
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:15.660]   is tied to my ability to do that, right?
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:17.540]   That, oh, but if I stop doing that
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:19.700]   and now I'm like, I'm eating and sleeping regularly,
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:21.060]   then I'm gonna lose some edge.
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:23.740]   And so, and even I think about this all the time,
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:27.580]   but I realize, hey, I'm also, I'm not doing it inside.
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:32.140]   And I think it's really grounding to the basics
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.520]   that really help us of like,
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:35.260]   what are the basics of what I'm doing
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:36.460]   and not doing in my life?
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:39.980]   Diet, exercise, sleep, people, circumstances,
[02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:42.360]   leisure activities, I mean, sunlight.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.600]   I mean, I think immensely important
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.180]   and dramatically undervalued.
[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:48.500]   - Well, I wanna thank you for that.
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:51.580]   And I wanna thank you for today's discussion.
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:54.320]   I found it to be incredibly informative
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.660]   and I know our listeners will also.
[02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.700]   I also wanna thank you for the work you do.
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.000]   I mean, you obviously run an incredibly robust
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.860]   clinical practice that I'm aware
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.700]   that you're constantly trying to improve,
[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:08.940]   even though it's operating at the highest levels already.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.740]   And I really, the reason why you're here today
[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:15.540]   is because I've done a wide and deep search
[02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:18.460]   for people in these areas.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:22.340]   And there are so few who have the background
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.940]   in medical training and physiology
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:28.220]   in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric realm,
[02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:33.220]   and also have a grounding toward the future of what's coming
[02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:36.900]   and who can encapsulate so many different orientations
[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:39.560]   and bring them together into a coherent piece.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.640]   So I really thank you. - I so appreciate that.
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:45.600]   - Yeah, and for your book, which is incredible,
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.260]   I will go on record saying,
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.420]   I think this is the definitive book on trauma.
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:53.800]   And I really encourage people to read it
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.780]   and will continue to encourage people to read it.
[02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:59.820]   So many valuable takeaways and insights and tools there.
[02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:03.340]   So on behalf of the listeners and myself,
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:05.980]   thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:06.860]   - You're very welcome.
[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:08.540]   And again, I take that to heart
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:10.440]   and I'm very appreciative of being here.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.900]   So you're very welcome and thank you as well.
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:13.780]   - Thank you.
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:15.420]   Thank you for joining me for my discussion
[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:16.940]   with Dr. Paul Conte.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:20.480]   I also highly recommend that you explore his new book,
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:22.900]   which is "Trauma, The Invisible Epidemic,
[02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:25.480]   How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It."
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:26.840]   It's an exceptional resource,
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.280]   both for those that have trauma
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:30.460]   and those that don't have trauma
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:33.340]   or those that suspect they might have trauma.
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:36.100]   Again, it's a deep dive into what trauma is
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:39.320]   and offers many simple tools that anyone can apply
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.100]   with a therapist or not in order to heal from trauma.
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:45.000]   And if you'd like to learn more about Dr. Conte
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.480]   and the work he does directly with patients,
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:50.540]   please check out his website, pacificpremiergroup.com.
[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:52.900]   We've also provided a link to both the book
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:56.540]   and pacificpremiergroup.com in the show note captions.
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:59.020]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.040]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.660]   That is the best way to support this podcast.
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:31.060]   Not so much in today's episode,
[02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:33.900]   but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.560]   we discuss supplements.
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.920]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:40.340]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:42.780]   for things like improving the transition time
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:44.600]   and the depth of sleep each night,
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:47.500]   for improving focus, for managing anxiety,
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:49.420]   and for many other aspects of mental health,
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:51.400]   physical health, and performance.
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:53.380]   For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:55.660]   has partnered with Momentus Supplements,
[02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:58.580]   because first off, they are of the very highest quality.
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:00.480]   They also ship internationally,
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:03.080]   which many other supplement companies do not.
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.760]   And we wanted to have a one-stop location
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:08.500]   where people could find and access the supplements
[02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:10.660]   that are discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:14.000]   So if you go to livemomentus.com/huberman,
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.900]   you will find many of the supplements
[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:18.380]   that are commonly discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:21.260]   I should just mention that the catalog of supplements there
[02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:23.780]   will be expanding in the weeks and months to follow,
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:26.400]   but already a number of them for sleep and focus
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:27.640]   and other aspects of mental health,
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:29.820]   physical health, and performance are already there
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:32.460]   at livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.320]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:36.800]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:39.360]   There I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:40.980]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:42.200]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.780]   but much of which is distinct from the information covered
[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:46.780]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:47.980]   We also have a newsletter
[02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:49.940]   called the Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:52.100]   where we offer distilled information,
[02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:54.080]   so lists of protocols and key takeaways
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.660]   from podcast episodes.
[02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.460]   If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:58.980]   all it requires is your email.
[02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:01.420]   Please know that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.540]   We have a very clear privacy policy.
[02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:06.180]   You can find all that by going to HubermanLab.com.
[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:08.700]   There's a menu there where you can sign up
[02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:10.020]   for the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:12.360]   You can also immediately get access
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.900]   to some example newsletters
[02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:16.480]   so you know what the newsletter is all about.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:18.100]   So thank you once again for joining me
[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:20.260]   for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte.
[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:22.620]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.500]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:27.080]   [upbeat music]
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.660]   (upbeat music)
